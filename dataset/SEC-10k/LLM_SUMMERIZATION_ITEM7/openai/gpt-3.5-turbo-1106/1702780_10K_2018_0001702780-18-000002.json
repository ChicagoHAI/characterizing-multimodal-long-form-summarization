required by applicable federal securities laws.\nCertain numerical figures included in this annual report have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, such numerical figures shown as totals in various tables may not be arithmetic aggregations of the figures that precede them.\nOverview\nAll dollar amounts, except per customer and per share data, included in the following discussion, are presented in thousands.\nOur Business\nWe deliver broadband, pay television, telephony services, Wi-Fi hotspot access, proprietary content and advertising services to approximately 4.9 million residential and business customers. Our footprint extends across 21 states through a fiber-rich broadband network with approximately 8.6 million homes passed as of December 31, 2017. We have two reportable segments: Cablevision and Cequel. Cablevision provides broadband, pay television and telephony services to residential and business customers in and around the New York metropolitan area. Cequel provides broadband, pay television and telephony services to residential and business customers in the south-central United States, with the majority of its customers located in the ten states of Texas, West Virginia, Louisiana, Arkansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Arizona, California, Missouri and Ohio.\nKey Factors Impacting Operating Results and Financial Condition\nOur future performance is dependent, to a large extent, on the impact of direct competition, general economic conditions (including capital and credit market conditions), our ability to manage our businesses effectively, and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace, both with suppliers and customers. For more information see Risk Factors\u201d and Business-Competition\u201d included herein.\nWe derive revenue principally through monthly charges to residential customers of our pay television, broadband, and telephony services. We also derive revenue from equipment rental, DVR, VOD, pay-per-view, installation and home shopping commissions. Our residential pay television, broadband, and telephony services accounted for approximately 45%, 27% and 9%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. We also derive revenue from the sale of a wide and growing variety of products and services to both large enterprise and SMB customers, including broadband, telephony, networking and pay television services. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 14% of our consolidated revenue was derived from these business services. In addition, we derive revenues from the sale of advertising time available on the programming carried on our cable television systems, which accounted for approximately 4% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated revenue.\nRevenue increases are derived from rate increases, increases in the number of customers to our services, including additional services sold to our existing customers, programming package upgrades by our pay television customers, speed tier upgrades by our broadband customers, and acquisitions of cable systems that result in the addition of new customers.\nOur ability to increase the number of customers to our services is significantly related to our penetration rates.\nWe operate in a highly competitive consumer-driven industry and we compete against a variety of broadband, pay television and telephony providers and delivery systems, including broadband communications companies, wireless data and telephony providers, satellite-delivered video signals, Internet-delivered video content and broadcast television signals available to residential and business customers in our service areas. Our competitors include AT&T and its DirecTV subsidiary, CenturyLink, DISH Network, Frontier and Verizon. Consumers' selection of an alternate source of service, whether due to economic constraints, technological advances or preference, negatively impacts the demand for our services. For more information on our competitive landscape, see Risk Factors\u201d and Business-Competition\u201d included herein.\nOur programming costs, which are the most significant component of our operating expenses, have increased and are expected to continue to increase primarily as a result of contractual rate increases and new channel launches. See -Results of Operations\u201d below for more information regarding our key factors impacting our revenues and operating expenses.\nHistorically, we have made substantial investments in our network and the development of new and innovative products and other service offerings for our customers as a way of differentiating ourselves from our competitors and may continue to do so in the future. We have commenced a five-year plan to build a FTTH network, which will enable us to deliver more than 10 Gbps broadband speeds across our entire Optimum footprint and part of our Suddenlink footprint. We may incur greater than anticipated capital expenditures in connection with this initiative, fail to realize anticipated benefits, experience delays and business disruptions or encounter other challenges to executing it as planned. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Capital Expenditures\u201d for additional information regarding our capital expenditures.\nCertain Transactions\nThe following transactions occurred during the periods covered by this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations:\nOn June 21, 2016, Altice USA acquired Cablevision for a total purchase price of approximately $9,958,323. The Altice USA operating results include the operating results of Cablevision from the date of acquisition.\nIn July 2016, we completed the sale of a 75% interest in Newsday LLC and retained the remaining 25% ownership interest. Effective July 7, 2016, the operating results of Newsday are no longer consolidated with our results and our 25% interest in the operating results of Newsday is recorded on the equity basis.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net income (loss) excluding income taxes, income (loss) from discontinued operations, other non-operating income or expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing costs, gain (loss) on interest rate swap contracts, gain (loss) on derivative contracts, gain (loss) on investments, interest expense (including cash interest expense), interest income, depreciation and amortization (including impairments), share-based compensation expense or benefit, restructuring expense or credits and transaction expenses. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry. Internally, we use revenue and Adjusted EBITDA measures as important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides management and investors a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business and operating results by excluding items that are not comparable across reporting periods or that do not otherwise relate to the Company's ongoing operating results. Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), and other measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Since Adjusted EBITDA is not\na measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies.\nResults

Most of these accounts are also not entirely free, as they typically generate revenue through pay-per-view or other pay services and certain equipment fees. Free status is not granted to regular customers as a promotion. In counting bulk residential customers, such as an\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\napartment building, we count each subscribing family unit within the building as one customer, but do not count the master account for the entire building as a customer.

</tr>\n</table>\nAltice USA - Comparison of Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nPay Television Revenue\nPay television revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $4,214,745 and $2,759,216, respectively, of which $3,113,238 and $1,638,691 was derived from the Cablevision segment and $1,101,507 and $1,120,525 relates to our Cequel segment, respectively. Pay television is derived principally through monthly charges to residential customers of our pay television services. Revenue increases are derived primarily from rate increases, increases in the number of customers, including additional services sold to our existing customers, and programming package upgrades.\nPay television revenue for our Cablevision segment increased $1,474,547 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to the consolidation of the Cablevision results as of June 21, 2016, the date of the Cablevision Acquisition. Our 2016 results do not include pay television revenue\nof $1,468,006 recognized by Cablevision for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016. Pay television revenue was also impacted by rate increases for certain video services implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2017, an increase in late fees and an increase in pay-per-view revenue. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in revenue as compared to the prior year due to a decline in pay television customers.\nPay television revenue for our Cequel segment decreased $19,018 (2%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was due primarily to a decline in the number of pay television customers and a decrease in premium video services revenue, partially offset by certain rate increases, and an increase in late fees.\nWe believe our pay television customer declines noted in the table above are largely attributable to competition, particularly from Verizon in our Cablevision footprint and DBS providers in our Cequel footprint, as well as competition from companies that deliver video content over the Internet directly to customers. These factors are expected to continue to impact our ability to maintain or increase our existing customers and revenue in the future.\nBroadband Revenue\nBroadband revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $2,563,772 and $1,617,029, respectively, of which $1,603,015 and $782,615 was derived from our Cablevision segment and $960,757 and $834,414 was derived from our Cequel segment. Broadband revenue is derived principally through monthly charges to residential customers of our broadband services. Revenue increases are derived primarily from rate increases, increases in the number of customers, including additional services sold to our existing customers, and speed tier upgrades.\nBroadband revenue for our Cablevision segment increased $820,400 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to the consolidation of the Cablevision results as of June 21, 2016, the date of the Cablevision Acquisition. Our 2016 results do not include broadband revenue of $673,010 recognized by Cablevision for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016. Broadband revenue also increased $147,390 as a result of higher average recurring broadband revenue per broadband customer (driven by rate increases, the impact of service level changes, and an increase in late fees) and an increase in broadband customers.\nBroadband revenue for our Cequel segment increased $126,343 (15%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was due primarily to higher average recurring broadband revenue per broadband customer (driven by rate increases, the impact of service level changes, and an increase in late fees) and an increase in broadband customers.\nTelephony Revenue\nTelephony revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $823,981 and $529,973 of which $693,478 and $376,034 was derived from the Cablevision segment and $130,503 and $153,939 was derived from our Cequel segment. Telephony revenue is derived principally through monthly charges to residential customers of our telephony services. Revenue increases are derived primarily from rate increases, increases in the number of customers, and additional services sold to our existing customers.\nTelephony revenue for our Cablevision segment increased $317,444 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to the consolidation of the Cablevision results as of June 21, 2016, the date of the Cablevision Acquisition. Our 2016 results do not include telephony revenue of $342,142 recognized by Cablevision for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016. Offsetting this increase was a net decrease of $24,698 due primarily to lower average revenue per telephony customer and a decline in international calling.\nTelephony revenue for our Cequel segment decreased $23,436 (15%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was due primarily to lower average revenue per telephony customer and a decline in telephony customers.\nBusiness Services and Wholesale Revenue\nBusiness services and wholesale revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $1,298,817 and $819,541, respectively of which $923,161 and $468,632 was derived from the Cablevision segment and $375,656 and $350,909 was derived from our Cequel segment. Business services and wholesale revenue is derived primarily from the sale of fiber based telecommunications services to the business market, and the sale of broadband, pay television and telephony services to SMB customers.\nBusiness services and wholesale revenue for our Cablevision segment increased $454,529 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to the consolidation of the Cablevision results as of June 21, 2016, the date of the Cablevision Acquisition. Our 2016 results do not include revenue of $411,102 recognized by Cablevision for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016. Business services revenue also increased $43,427 primarily due to higher average recurring telephony and broadband revenue per SMB customer and an increase in\nEthernet revenue resulting from a larger number of services installed, partially offset by reduced traditional voice and data services for commercial customers.\nBusiness services and wholesale revenue for our Cequel segment increased $24,747 (7%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher commercial rates and customers for broadband services, an increase in certain pay television rates and increases in commercial carrier services.\nAdvertising Revenue\nAdvertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, net of inter-segment revenue, was $391,866 and $252,049, respectively, of which $321,149 and $163,678 was derived from our Cablevision segment and $73,509 and $88,371 was derived from our Cequel segment. Advertising revenue is primarily derived from the sale of advertising time available on the programming carried on our cable television systems.\nAdvertising revenue for our Cablevision segment increased $157,471 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to the consolidation of the Cablevision results as of June 21, 2016, the date of the Cablevision Acquisition. Our 2016 results do not include advertising revenue of $125,419 recognized by Cablevision for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016. The remaining increase in advertising revenue of $32,052 was due primarily to an increase in digital advertising revenue and an increase in data and analytics revenue, partially offset by a decrease in political advertising.\nAdvertising revenue for our Cequel segment decreased $14,862 (17%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is due to declines in political, auto, retail, and restaurant advertising.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $33,389 and $39,404, respectively, of which $10,747 and $14,402 was derived from our Cablevision segment and $22,642 and $25,002 was derived from our Cequel segment. Other revenue includes other miscellaneous revenue streams.\nProgramming and Other Direct Costs\nProgramming and other direct costs, net of intersegment eliminations, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 amounted to $3,035,655 and $1,911,230, respectively, of which $2,280,062 and $1,164,925 relate to our Cablevision segment and $758,190 and $746,305 relate to our Cequel segment. Programming and other direct costs include cable programming costs, which are costs paid to programmers (net of amortization of any incentives received from programmers for carriage) for cable content (including costs of VOD and pay-per-view) and are generally paid on a per-customer basis. These costs typically rise due to increases in contractual rates and new channel launches and are also impacted by changes in the number of customers receiving certain programming services. These costs also include interconnection, call completion, circuit and transport fees paid to other telecommunication companies for the transport and termination of voice and data services, which typically vary based on rate changes and the level of usage by our customers. These costs also include franchise fees which are payable to the state governments and local municipalities where we operate and are primarily based on a percentage of certain categories of revenue derived from the provision of pay television service over our cable systems, which vary by state and municipality. These costs change in relation to changes in such categories of revenues or rate changes.\nThe increase of $1,115,137 related to our Cablevision segment for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year is primarily due to the consolidation of the Cablevision results as of June 21, 2016, the date of the Cablevision Acquisition. Our 2016 results do not include $1,088,555 of programming and other direct costs recognized by Cablevision for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016. The remaining increase of $26,582 is attributable to the following:\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cablevision segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in programming costs due primarily to contractual rate increases and an increase in pay-per-view costs primarily from an event in August 2017, partially offset by lower pay television customers and lower video-on-demand costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in costs of digital media advertising spots for resale\n</td> <td>23,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in costs primarily related to the sale of Newsday in July 2016\n</td> <td>(33,888\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in call completion and transport costs primarily due to lower level of activity\n</td> <td>(17,881\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in cost of sales (which includes the bulk sale of handset inventory of $5,445 during the first quarter of 2016)\n</td> <td>(9,945\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other net increases\n</td> <td>3,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase of $11,885 related to our Cequel segment for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year period is attributable to the following:\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cequel segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in programming costs due primarily to contractual rate increases and an increase in pay-per-view costs primarily from an event in August 2017, partially offset by lower pay television customers and lower video-on-demand costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in franchise costs due to lower pay television customers\n</td> <td>(5,159\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in media cost of sales\n</td> <td>(1,634\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net decrease in call completion and interconnection costs due to lower level of activity\n</td> <td>(1,803\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other net increases\n</td> <td>340\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProgramming costs\nProgramming costs aggregated $2,533,244 and $1,567,688 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The 2016 amount does not include programming costs of $883,792 recognized by Cablevision for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016. Our programming costs in 2018 will continue to be impacted by changes in programming rates, which we expect to increase by high single digits, and by changes in the number of pay television customers.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 amounted to $2,342,655 and $1,705,615, respectively, of which $1,675,665 and $1,028,447 relate to our Cablevision segment and $667,185 and $677,168 relate to our Cequel segment. Other operating expenses include staff costs and employee benefits including salaries of company employees and related taxes, benefits and other employee related expenses. Other operating expenses also include network management and field service costs, which represent costs associated with the maintenance of our broadband network, including costs of certain customer connections and other costs associated with providing and maintaining services to our customers.\nCustomer installation and repair and maintenance costs may fluctuate as a result of changes in the level of activities and the utilization of contractors as compared to employees. Also, customer installation costs fluctuate as the portion of our expenses that we are able to capitalize changes. Costs associated with the initial deployment of new customer premise equipment necessary to provide broadband, pay television and telephony services are capitalized (asset-based). In circumstances where customer premise equipment tracking is not available, the Company estimates the amount of capitalized installation costs based on whether or not the business or residence had been previously connected to the network, (premise-based). Network repair and maintenance and utility costs also fluctuate as capitalizable network upgrade and enhancement activity changes.\nIn connection with the execution of an agreement with ATS in the second quarter of 2017 (see Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements), the Cablevision segment's operating results reflect a reduction in employee related expenses due to certain employees becoming employed by ATS and an increase in contractor costs for services provided by ATS. See further details in the table below. A substantial portion of the Cequel segment technical workforce became employees of ATS in December 2017.\nIn January 2018, the Company acquired 70% of the equity interests in ATS and the Company expects to become the owner of 100% of the equity interests in ATS prior to the Distribution (see Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements).\nOther operating expenses also include costs related to the operation and maintenance of our call center facilities that handle customer inquiries and billing and collection activities and sales and marketing costs, which include advertising production and placement costs associated with acquiring and retaining customers. These costs vary period to period and certain of these costs, such as sales and marketing, may increase with intense competition. Additionally, other operating expenses include various other administrative costs, including legal fees, and product development costs.\nThe increase of $647,218 related to our Cablevision segment for the year ended December 31, 2017, net of inter-segment eliminations, as compared to the prior year is primarily due to the consolidation of the Cablevision results as of June 21, 2016, the date of the Cablevision Acquisition. Our 2016 results do not include $1,136,970 of other operating expenses recognized by Cablevision for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016. The remaining decrease of $489,752 is attributable to the following:\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cablevision segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease primarily in employee related costs related to the elimination of certain positions (including the impact of the decline in headcount resulting from the ATS agreement), and lower net benefits, partially offset by merit increases\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(457,528\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in costs primarily related to the sale of Newsday in July 2016\n</td> <td>(95,262\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease primarily related to maintenance agreements for equipment, as well as lower repairs and maintenance costs relating to our operations\n</td> <td>(69,053\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in rent and insurance (including the impact of the ATS agreement)\n</td> <td>(24,138\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in contractor costs due primarily to the execution of the ATS agreement\n</td> <td>114,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in sales and marketing costs\n</td> <td>18,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in bad debt expense\n</td> <td>10,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in fees for certain executive services provided by our parent entity (twelve months in 2017 compared to approximately six months in 2016)\n</td> <td>9,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other net increases\n</td> <td>3,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(489,752\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease of $9,983 related to our Cequel segment for the year ended December 31, 2017, net of inter-segment eliminations, as compared to the prior year period is attributable to the following:\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cequel segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease primarily in salaries and benefits related to the elimination of certain positions in connection with the initiatives to simplify the Company's organizational structure, partially offset by a decrease in capitalizable activity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(56,381\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in insurance costs\n</td> <td>(6,255\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in contract labor costs\n</td> <td>(2,171\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in consulting and professional fees\n</td> <td>22,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in share-based compensation and long-term incentive plan awards expense\n</td> <td>18,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in sales and marketing costs\n</td> <td>8,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in worker's compensation expenses\n</td> <td>2,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in property, general and sales and use taxes\n</td> <td>1,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other net increases\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,983\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRestructuring and Other Expense\nRestructuring and other expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $152,401 ($112,384 for our Cablevision segment and $40,017 for our Cequel segment) as compared to $240,395 for the year ended December 31, 2016 ($212,150 for our Cablevision segment and $28,245 for our Cequel segment). These amounts primarily relate to severance and other employee related costs resulting from headcount reductions related to initiatives which commenced in 2016 that are intended to simplify the Company's organizational structure. We currently anticipate that additional restructuring expenses will be recognized as we continue to analyze our organizational structure.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 amounted to $2,930,475 and $1,700,306, respectively, of which $2,251,614 and $963,665 relates to our Cablevision segment and $678,861 and $736,641 relates to our Cequel segment.\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization related to our Cablevision segment of $1,287,949 is primarily due to the consolidation of the Cablevision results as of June 21, 2016, the date of the Cablevision Acquisition. Our 2016 results do not include $414,550 of depreciation and amortization recognized by Cablevision for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016. The remaining increase of $873,399 is primarily attributable to the acceleration of amortization of its trade name intangible assets in connection with the announcement, on May 23, 2017, of the adoption of a global brand to replace the Optimum brand in the future, as well as depreciation on new asset additions. In December 2017, the Company made a decision to postpone the adoption of a global brand that would have replaced the Optimum brand, increasing the useful life of the Optimum trade name intangible asset to 5 years, which will reduce the future annual amortization expense related to the Optimum trade name.\nThe decrease in depreciation and amortization related to our Cequel segment of $57,780 (8%) is due primarily to lower amortization expense for certain intangible assets that are being amortized using an accelerated method, partially offset by an increase resulting from revisions made to the fair value of assets acquired resulting from the finalization in the fourth quarter of 2016 of the purchase price allocation in connection with the Cequel Acquisition.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA amounted to $4,005,690 and $2,414,735 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, of which $2,751,121 and $1,259,844 relates to our Cablevision segment and $1,254,569 and $1,154,891 relates to our Cequel segment.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as net loss excluding income taxes, loss from discontinued operations, other non-operating income or expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing costs, gain (loss) on interest rate swap contracts, gain (loss) on derivative contracts, gain (loss) on investments, interest expense (including cash interest expense), interest income, depreciation and amortization (including impairments), share-based compensation expense, restructuring expense or credits and transaction expenses. See reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA above.\nThe increase in adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compare to the prior year was due to the consolidation of the Cablevision results as of June 21, 2016, the date of the Cablevision Acquisition and the increases in revenue and decreases in operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization, restructuring and other expense and share-based compensation), as discussed above.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net was $1,601,211 and $1,442,730, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and includes interest on debt issued to finance the Cablevision Acquisition and Cequel Acquisition, as well as interest on debt assumed in connection with these acquisitions. The increase of $158,481 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year is attributable to the following:\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase due to changes in average debt balances and interest rates on our indebtedness and collateralized debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lower interest income\n</td> <td>11,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other net increases, primarily amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts\n</td> <td>4,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" discussion below for a detail of our borrower groups.\nGain on Investments, net\nGain on investments, net for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, of $237,354 and $141,896 consists primarily of the increase in the fair value of Comcast common stock owned by the Company for the periods. For 2016, the gain is for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016. The effects of these gains are partially offset by the losses on the related equity derivative contracts, net described below.\nLoss on Derivative Contracts, net\nLoss on derivative contracts, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $236,330 compared to $53,696 for the year ended December 31, 2016, and includes realized and unrealized losses due to the change in fair value of equity derivative contracts relating to the Comcast common stock owned by the Company. For 2016, the loss is for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016. The effects of these losses are offset by gains on investment securities pledged as collateral, which are included in gain on investments, net discussed above. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 also includes the realized loss on the settlement of certain put-call options of $97,410.\nGain (loss) on interest rate swap contracts\nGain (loss) on interest rate swap contracts was $5,482 and $(72,961) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. These amounts represent the increase or decrease in fair value of the fixed to floating interest rate swaps entered into by our Cequel segment in September 2016. The objective of these swaps is to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to fixed and variable interest rates. These swap contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing costs\nLoss on extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing costs amounted to $600,240 and $127,649 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The 2017 amount includes the premium of $513,723 related to the notes payable to affiliates and related parties that were converted into shares of the Company's common stock, $18,976 related to the Cablevision Extension Amendment and the redemption of senior notes, $28,684 related to the Cequel Extension\nAmendment and the redemption of senior notes and $38,858 related to premiums paid upon the early repayment of certain senior notes outstanding.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt amounted to $127,649 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and includes primarily the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and the unamortized discount relating to the prepayment of $1,290,500 outstanding under the term credit facility at Cablevision.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nThe Company recorded income tax benefit of $2,852,967 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Pursuant to the enactment of Tax Reform on December 22, 2017, the Company recorded a noncash deferred tax benefit of $2,337,900 to remeasure the net deferred tax liability to adjust for the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% which is effective on January 1, 2018. Nondeductible share-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 reduced income tax benefit by $22,938.\nThe Company recorded income tax benefit of $259,666 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Nondeductible share-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 reduced income tax benefit by $5,747.\nOn June 9, 2016 the common stock of Cequel was contributed to the Company. On June 21, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Cablevision. Accordingly, Cequel and Cablevision joined the federal consolidated and certain state combined income tax returns of the Company. As a result, the applicate tax rate used to measure deferred tax assets and liabilities increased, resulting in a non-cash deferred income tax charge of $153,660 in the second quarter of 2016. In addition, there was no state income tax benefit on the pre-merger accrued interest at Neptune Finco Corp. (\"Finco\"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Altice N.V. formed to complete the financing for the Cablevision Acquisition and the merger with CSC Holdings, resulting in additional deferred tax expense of $18,542 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nResults of Operations - Cablevision Systems Corporation\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Pay television revenue for the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2016 was impacted by a decline in pay television customers, a decrease due to a pay-per-view boxing event that took place in 2015, partially offset by increases in revenue due primarily to rate increases for certain pay television services implemented during the first quarter of 2016 and an increase in fees charged to restore suspended services.\nWe believe our pay television customer declines noted in the table above are largely attributable to intense competition, particularly from Verizon, as well as competition from companies that deliver video content over the Internet directly to customers. Also, the declines are attributable to our disciplined pricing and credit policies. These factors are expected to continue to impact our ability to maintain or increase our existing customers and revenue in the future.\nBroadband Revenue\nBroadband revenue amounted to $782,615 and $673,010 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $1,303,918 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Broadband revenue for the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2016 was impacted by rate increases for certain broadband services implemented during the first quarter of 2016, an increase in broadband customers, and an increase in fees charged to restore suspended services.\nTelephony Revenue\nTelephony revenue amounted to $376,034 and $342,142 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $748,181 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Telephony revenue for the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2016 was impacted by a decline in telephony customers and a decline in international calling.\nBusiness Services Revenue\nBusiness services and wholesale revenue amounted to $468,632 and $411,102 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $834,154 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Business services and wholesale revenue for the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2016 was impacted by rate increases for certain broadband services implemented during the first quarter of 2016, an increase in broadband customers and an increase in Ethernet revenue from an increase in services installed, partially offset by reduced traditional voice and data services.\nAdvertising Revenue\nAdvertising revenue amounted to $163,678 and $125,419 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $263,839 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Advertising revenue for the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2016 was impacted by an increase in advertising sales to the political sector.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue amounted to $14,402 and $117,925 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and\nJanuary 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $252,462 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Other revenue for the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2016 includes revenue recognized by Newsday through July 7, 2016, affiliation fees paid by cable operators for carriage of our News 12 Networks and other revenue sources. On July 7, 2016, the Company sold a 75% interest in Newsday and as a result no longer consolidates its operating results. As of July 7, 2016, the Company's 25% interest in the operating results of Newsday is recorded on the equity basis.\nProgramming and Other Direct Costs\nProgramming and other direct costs include cable programming costs, which are costs paid to programmers (net of amortization of any incentives received from programmers for carriage) for cable content (including costs of VOD and pay-per-view) and are generally paid on a per-customer basis.\nThese costs typically rise due to increases in contractual rates and new channel launches and are also impacted by changes in the number of customers receiving certain programming services. These costs also include interconnection, call completion, circuit and transport fees paid to other telecommunication companies for the transport and termination of voice and data services, which typically vary based on rate changes and the level of usage by our customers. These costs also include franchise fees which are payable to the state governments and local municipalities where we operate and are primarily based on a percentage of certain categories of revenue derived from the provision of pay television service over our cable systems, which vary by state and municipality. These costs change in relation to changes in such categories of revenues or rate changes. These costs also included content, production and distribution costs of the Newsday business.\nProgramming and other direct costs amounted to $1,164,925 and $1,088,555 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $2,269,290 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Programming and other direct costs for the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2016 were impacted by an increase in programming costs due primarily to contractual rate increases, partially offset by lower video customers. These costs were also impacted by the lower costs related to Newsday (due to the sale of our 75% interest in Newsday in July 2016), lower call completion and transport costs primarily due to lower level of activity, lower cost of sales related to wireless handset inventory and higher franchise and other fees due primarily to increases in rates in certain areas, partially offset by lower pay television customers.\nProgramming costs aggregated $978,120 and $883,792 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $1,796,021 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our programming costs increased 4% for the 2016 periods due primarily to an increase in contractual programming rates and a pay-per-view boxing event in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in telephony customers.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses include staff costs and employee benefits including salaries of company employees and related taxes, benefits and other employee-related expenses. Other operating expenses also include network management and field service costs, which represent costs associated with the maintenance of our broadband network, including costs of certain customer connections and other costs associated with providing and maintaining services to our customers which are impacted by general cost increases for contractors, insurance and other various expenses.\nCustomer installation and repair and maintenance costs may fluctuate as a result of changes in the level of activities and the utilization of contractors as compared to employees. Also, customer installation costs fluctuate as the portion of our expenses that we are able to capitalize changes. Network repair and maintenance and utility costs also fluctuate as capitalizable network upgrade and enhancement activity changes.\nOther operating expenses also include costs related to the operation and maintenance of our call center facilities that handle customer inquiries and billing and collection activities and sales and marketing costs, which include advertising production and placement costs associated with acquiring and retaining customers. These costs vary period to period and certain costs, such as sales and marketing, may increase with intense competition. Additionally, other operating expenses include various other administrative costs, including legal fees, and product development costs.\nOther operating expenses amounted to $1,028,447 and $1,136,970 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $2,546,319 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Other operating expenses for the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2016 were impacted by a decrease in employee-related costs related to the elimination of certain positions, lower benefits and an increase in capitalizable activity, partially offset by merit increases. These costs were also impacted by the lower costs related to Newsday (due to the sale of our 75% interest in Newsday in July 2016), a decrease in share based compensation, a decrease in long-term incentive plan awards, lower legal costs, lower sales and marketing costs, lower repair and maintenance expenses, lower contractor costs, a settlement of a class action legal matter in 2015, partially offset by an increase in the management fee to Altice N.V.\nRestructuring and Other Expense\nRestructuring and other expense amounted to $212,150 and $22,223 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $16,213 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Restructuring and other expense for the Successor 2016 period is primarily related to severance and other employee related costs resulting from headcount reductions related to initiatives which commenced in the Successor period that are intended to simplify the Company's organizational structure.\nThe restructuring and other expense for the Predecessor 2016 period is primarily related to transaction costs of $19,924 incurred in connection with the Cablevision Acquisition and adjustments related to prior restructuring plans of $2,299. Restructuring and other expense for 2015 includes transaction costs incurred in connection with the Cablevision Acquisition of $17,862, net of adjustments related to prior restructuring plans of $1,649.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization (including impairments) amounted to $963,665 and $414,550 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $865,252 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Depreciation and amortization for the Successor period in 2016 was impacted by an increase in related to the step-up in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets recorded in connection with the Cablevision Acquisition on June 21, 2016, partially offset by certain assets being retired or becoming fully depreciated.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA amounted to $1,259,844 and $937,310 for the periods June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $1,795,222 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA for the 2016 periods was impacted by an increase in revenue, and a decrease in operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization, restructuring and other expense and share-based compensation), as discussed above.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense amounted to $606,347 and $285,508 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $584,839 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest expense for the Successor 2016 period includes additional interest related to the debt incurred to finance the Cablevision Acquisition.\nGain (Loss) on Investments, net\nGain (loss) on investments, net amounted to $141,896 and $129,990 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, and $(30,208) for the year ended December 31, 2015 and reflect the increase or decrease in the fair value of Comcast common stock owned by the Company. The effects of these gains (losses) are partially offset by the (losses) gains on the related equity derivative contracts, net described below.\nGain (Loss) on Equity Derivative Contracts, net\nGain (loss) on equity derivative contracts, net amounted to $(53,696) and $(36,283) for the periods June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, and $104,927 for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGain (loss) on equity derivative contracts, net consists of unrealized and realized gains (losses) due to the change in fair value of the Company's equity derivative contracts relating to the Comcast common stock owned by the Company. The effects of these gains (losses) are offset by the (losses) gains on investment securities pledged as collateral, which are included in gain (loss) on investments, net discussed above.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt and Write-off of Deferred Financing Costs\nLoss on extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing costs amounted to $102,894 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and $1,735 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Successor 2016 amount includes the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and the unamortized discount related to the prepayment of $1,290,500 outstanding under the CSC Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cablevision, term credit facility. The 2015 amount includes the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and the unamortized discount related to the $200,000 repayment of CSC Holdings term B loan facility.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax benefit (expense) amounted to $213,065 for the periods from June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016\nand $(124,848) for the period from January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016. In the Successor period, excluding the impact of the nondeductible share-based compensation of $3,208, the effective tax rate would have been 40%. In the Predecessor period, certain acquisition-related costs were determined to be nondeductible, resulting in additional deferred tax expense of $9,392. Absent this item, the effective tax rate would have been 40%.\nIncome tax expense of $154,872 for the year ended December 31, 2015, reflected an effective tax rate of 45%. In April 2015, corporate income tax changes were enacted for both New York State and the City of New York. Those changes included a provision whereby investment income will be subject to higher taxes. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2015, Cablevision recorded deferred tax expense of $16,334 to remeasure the deferred tax liability for the investment in Comcast common stock and associated derivative securities. Also in 2015, Cablevision recorded tax benefit of $2,630 related to research credits. Absent these items, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 would have been 41%.\nLoss From Discontinued Operations\nLoss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 amounted to $12,541, net of income taxes, and primarily reflects an expense related to the settlement of a legal matter relating to Rainbow Media Holdings LLC, a business whose operations were previously discontinued.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAltice USA has no operations independent of its subsidiaries, Cablevision and Cequel. Funding for our subsidiaries has generally been provided by cash flow from their respective operations, cash on hand and borrowings under their revolving credit facilities and the proceeds from the issuance of securities and borrowings under syndicated term loans in the capital markets. Our decision as to the use of cash generated from operating activities, cash on hand, borrowings under the revolving credit facilities or accessing the capital markets has been based upon an ongoing review of the funding needs of the business, the optimal allocation of cash resources, the timing of cash flow generation and the cost of borrowing under the revolving credit facilities, debt securities and syndicated term loans. We manage our business to a long-term net leverage ratio target of 4.5x to 5.0x. We calculate our consolidated net leverage ratio as net debt to L2QA EBITDA (Adjusted EBITDA for the two most recent consecutive fiscal quarters multiplied by 2.0).\nWe expect to utilize free cash flow and availability under the revolving credit facilities, as well as future refinancing transactions, to further extend the maturities of, or reduce the principal on, our debt obligations. The timing and terms of any refinancing transactions will be subject to, among other factors, market conditions. Additionally, we may, from time to time, depending on market conditions and other factors, use cash on hand and the proceeds from other borrowings to repay the outstanding debt securities through open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, tender offers, or redemptions.\nWe believe existing cash balances, operating cash flows and availability under our revolving credit facilities will provide adequate funds to support our current operating plan, make planned capital expenditures and fulfill our debt service requirements for the next twelve months. However, our ability to fund our operations, make planned capital expenditures, make scheduled payments on our indebtedness and repay our indebtedness depends on our future operating performance and cash flows and our ability to access the capital markets, which, in turn, are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our collateralized debt maturing in the next 12 months will be settled with proceeds from monetization contracts entered into pursuant to the Synthetic Monetization Closeout discussed below. However, competition, market disruptions or a deterioration in economic conditions could lead to lower demand for our products, as well as lower levels of advertising, and increased incidence of customers' inability to pay for the services we provide. These events would adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Although we currently believe that amounts available under the revolving credit facilities will be available when, and if, needed, we can provide no assurance that access to such funds will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets or other conditions. The obligations of the financial institutions under the revolving credit facilities are several and not joint and, as a result, a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others.\nIn the longer term, we do not expect to be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund anticipated capital expenditures, meet all existing future contractual payment obligations and repay our debt at maturity. As a result, we will be dependent upon our continued access to the capital and credit markets to issue additional debt or equity or refinance existing debt obligations. We will need to raise significant amounts of funding over the next several years to fund capital expenditures, repay existing obligations and meet other obligations, and the failure to do so successfully could adversely affect our business. If we are unable to do so, we will need to take other actions including deferring capital expenditures, selling assets, seeking strategic investments from third parties or reducing or eliminating discretionary uses of cash.\nInitial Public Offering\nIn June 2017, the Company completed its IPO of 71,724,139 shares of its Class A common stock (12,068,966 shares sold by the Company and 59,655,173 shares sold by existing stockholders) at a price to the public of $30.00 per share, including the underwriters full exercise of their option to purchase 7,781,110 shares to cover overallotments. The Company's Class A common stock began trading on June 22, 2017, on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ATUS\u201d.\nIn connection with the sale of its Class A common stock, the Company received proceeds of approximately $362,069, before deducting the underwriting discount and expenses directly related to the issuance of the securities of $12,998. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. In July 2017, the Company used approximately $350,120 of the proceeds to fund the redemption of $315,779 principal amount of 10.875% senior notes that mature in 2025 issued by CSC Holdings, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and the related call premium of approximately $34,341.\nDebt Outstanding\nThe following tables summarize the carrying value of our outstanding debt,

Partially offsetting these increases were net repayments of credit facility debt of $3,623,287, distributions to stockholders of $365,559, payments of deferred financing costs of $203,712, and principal payments on capital lease obligations of $18,837.\nSettlements of Collateralized Indebtedness\nThe following table summarizes the settlement of the Company's collateralized indebtedness relating to Comcast shares that was settled by delivering cash equal to the collateralized loan value, net of the value of the related equity derivative contracts during the year ended December 31, 2017:\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of shares (a)\n</td> <td>26,815,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collateralized indebtedness settled\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(774,703\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative contracts settled\n</td> <td>(56,356\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(831,059\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from new monetization contracts\n</td> <td>838,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash received\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Share amounts are adjusted for the 2 for 1 stock split in February 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The cash to settle the collateralized indebtedness was obtained from the proceeds of new monetization contracts covering an equivalent number of Comcast shares. The terms of the new contracts allow the Company to retain upside participation in Comcast shares up to each respective contract's upside appreciation limit with downside exposure limited to the respective hedge price.\nIn April 2017, the Company entered into new monetization contracts related to 32,153,118 shares of Comcast common stock held by Cablevision, which synthetically reversed the existing contracts related to these shares (the \"Synthetic Monetization Closeout\"). As the existing collateralized debt matures, the Company will settle the contracts with proceeds received from the new monetization contracts. The new monetization contracts mature on April 28, 2021. The new monetization contracts provide the Company with downside protection below the hedge price of $35.47 and upside benefit of stock price appreciation up to $44.72 per share. In connection with the execution of these contracts, the Company recorded (i) the fair value of the equity derivative contracts of $53,316 (in a net asset position), (ii) notes payable of $111,657, representing the fair value of the existing equity derivative contracts, in a liability position, and (iii) a discount on debt of $58,341.\nContractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet

For the years ended December 31,\n2017 and 2016, the amount of franchise fees and certain other taxes and fees included as a component of revenue aggregated $259,075 and $154,732, respectively.\nDividends and Distributions\nIn the second quarter of 2017, prior to the Company's IPO, the Company declared and paid cash distributions aggregating $839,700, $500,000 of which were funded with proceeds from borrowings under CSC Holdings' revolving credit facility. In 2016, the Company declared cash distributions of $445,176, of which $365,559 were paid in 2016 and $79,617 were paid in the first quarter of 2017.\nManaging our Interest Rate and Equity Price Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is primarily a result of exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of the yield curve, the volatility of interest rates and credit spreads. Our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in short-term interest rates. Interest rate risk exists primarily with respect to our credit facility debt, which bears interest at variable rates. The carrying value of our outstanding credit facility debt at December 31, 2017 amounted to $4,643,523.\nTo manage interest rate risk, we have from time to time entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates. Such contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates and/or effectively convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to permit the Company to realize lower interest expense in a declining interest rate environment. We monitor the financial institutions that are counterparties to our interest rate swap contracts and we only enter into interest rate swap contracts with financial institutions that are rated investment grade. All such contracts are carried at their fair market values on our consolidated balance sheet, with changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statement of operations.\nIn June 2016, a subsidiary of Cequel entered into two fixed to floating interest rate swaps. One fixed to floating interest rate swap is converting $750,000 from a fixed rate of 1.6655% to six-month LIBOR and a second tranche of $750,000 from a fixed rate of 1.68% to six-month LIBOR. The objective of these swaps is to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to fixed and variable interest rates.\nThese swap contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the changes in the fair value of these interest rate swap contracts are recorded through the statement of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a gain on interest rate swap contracts of $5,482.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our outstanding interest rate swap contracts had an aggregate fair value and carrying value of $77,902 reflected in \u2018\u2018liabilities under derivative contracts'' in our consolidated balance sheet.\nWe do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nSee discussion above for further details of our credit facility debt and See \"", "summary": "The report provides a comprehensive analysis of the company's financial condition and operating results, discussing forward-looking statements, risk factors, and key factors impacting the company's performance.

Words such as \"expects\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", \"estimates\", \"may\", \"will\", \"should\", \"could\", \"potential\", \"continue\", \"intends\", \"plans\" and similar words and terms used in the discussion of future operating results, future financial performance and future events identify forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, results or events and involve risks and uncertainties and that actual results or developments may differ materially from the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.\nWe operate in a highly competitive, consumer and technology driven and rapidly changing business that is affected by government regulation and economic, strategic, technological, political and social conditions. Various factors could adversely affect our operations, business or financial results in the future and cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements include:\n \u2022 competition for broadband, pay television and telephony customers from existing competitors (such as broadband communications companies, DBS providers and Internet-based providers) and new competitors entering our footprint; \n \u2022 changes in consumer preferences, laws and regulations or technology that may cause us to change our operational strategies; \n \u2022 increased difficulty negotiating programming agreements on favorable terms, if at all, resulting in increased costs to us and/or the loss of popular programming; \n \u2022 increasing programming costs and delivery expenses related to our products and services; \n \u2022 our ability to achieve anticipated customer and revenue growth, to successfully introduce new products and services and to implement our growth strategy; \n \u2022 our ability to complete our capital investment plans on time and on budget, including our plan to build a FTTH network, and deploy Altice One, our new home communications hub; \n \u2022 our ability to develop and deploy mobile voice and data services pursuant to the agreement we entered into with Sprint in the fourth quarter of 2017; \n \u2022 the effects of economic conditions or other factors which may negatively affect our customers' demand for our products and services; \n \u2022 the effects of industry conditions; \n \u2022 demand for advertising on our cable systems; \n \u2022 our substantial indebtedness and debt service obligations; \n \u2022 adverse changes in the credit market; \n \u2022 changes as a result of any tax reforms that may affect our business; \n \u2022 financial community and rating agency perceptions of our business, operations, financial condition and the industries in which we operate; \n \u2022 the restrictions contained in our financing agreements; \n \u2022 our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations; \n \u2022 fluctuations in interest rates which may cause our interest expense to vary from quarter to quarter; \n \u2022 technical failures, equipment defects, physical or electronic break-ins to our services, computer viruses and similar problems; \n \u2022 the disruption or failure of our network, information systems or technologies as a result of computer hacking, computer viruses, cyber-attacks,\u201d misappropriation of data, outages, natural disasters and other material events; \n \u2022 our ability to obtain necessary hardware, software, communications equipment and services and other items from our vendors at reasonable costs; \n \u2022 our ability to effectively integrate acquisitions and to maximize expected operating efficiencies from our acquisitions or as a result of the transactions, if any; \n \u2022 significant unanticipated increases in the use of bandwidth-intensive Internet-based services; \n \u2022 the outcome of litigation, government investigations and other proceedings; \n \u2022 our ability to successfully operate our business following the completion of our separation from Altice N.V., and \n \u2022 other risks and uncertainties inherent in our cable and other broadband communications businesses and our other businesses, including those listed under the caption Risk Factors\u201d and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" contained herein.  We disclaim any obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements contained herein, except as otherwise required by applicable federal securities laws.\nCertain numerical figures included in this annual report have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, such numerical figures shown as totals in various tables may not be arithmetic aggregations of the figures that precede them.\nOverview\nAll dollar amounts, except per customer and per share data, included in the following discussion, are presented in thousands.\nOur Business\nWe deliver broadband, pay television, telephony services, Wi-Fi hotspot access, proprietary content and advertising services to approximately 4.9 million residential and business customers. Our footprint extends across 21 states through a fiber-rich broadband network with approximately 8.6 million homes passed as of December 31, 2017. We have two reportable segments: Cablevision and Cequel. Cablevision provides broadband, pay television and telephony services to residential and business customers in and around the New York metropolitan area. Cequel provides broadband, pay television and telephony services to residential and business customers in the south-central United States, with the majority of its customers located in the ten states of Texas, West Virginia, Louisiana, Arkansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Arizona, California, Missouri and Ohio.\nKey Factors Impacting Operating Results and Financial Condition\nOur future performance is dependent, to a large extent, on the impact of direct competition, general economic conditions (including capital and credit market conditions), our ability to manage our businesses effectively, and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace, both with suppliers and customers. For more information see Risk Factors\u201d and Business-Competition\u201d included herein.\nWe derive revenue principally through monthly charges to residential customers of our pay television, broadband, and telephony services. We also derive revenue from equipment rental, DVR, VOD, pay-per-view, installation and home shopping commissions. Our residential pay television, broadband, and telephony services accounted for approximately 45%, 27% and 9%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. We also derive revenue from the sale of a wide and growing variety of products and services to both large enterprise and SMB customers, including broadband, telephony, networking and pay television services. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 14% of our consolidated revenue was derived from these business services. In addition, we derive revenues from the sale of advertising time available on the programming carried on our cable television systems, which accounted for approximately 4% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated revenue.\nRevenue increases are derived from rate increases, increases in the number of customers to our services, including additional services sold to our existing customers, programming package upgrades by our pay television customers, speed tier upgrades by our broadband customers, and acquisitions of cable systems that result in the addition of new customers.\nOur ability to increase the number of customers to our services is significantly related to our penetration rates.\nWe operate in a highly competitive consumer-driven industry and we compete against a variety of broadband, pay television and telephony providers and delivery systems, including broadband communications companies, wireless data and telephony providers, satellite-delivered video signals, Internet-delivered video content and broadcast television signals available to residential and business customers in our service areas. Our competitors include AT&T and its DirecTV subsidiary, CenturyLink, DISH Network, Frontier and Verizon. Consumers' selection of an alternate source of service, whether due to economic constraints, technological advances or preference, negatively impacts the demand for our services. For more information on our competitive landscape, see Risk Factors\u201d and Business-Competition\u201d included herein.\nOur programming costs, which are the most significant component of our operating expenses, have increased and are expected to continue to increase primarily as a result of contractual rate increases and new channel launches. See -Results of Operations\u201d below for more information regarding our key factors impacting our revenues and operating expenses.\nHistorically, we have made substantial investments in our network and the development of new and innovative products and other service offerings for our customers as a way of differentiating ourselves from our competitors and may continue to do so in the future. We have commenced a five-year plan to build a FTTH network, which will enable us to deliver more than 10 Gbps broadband speeds across our entire Optimum footprint and part of our Suddenlink footprint. We may incur greater than anticipated capital expenditures in connection with this initiative, fail to realize anticipated benefits, experience delays and business disruptions or encounter other challenges to executing it as planned. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Capital Expenditures\u201d for additional information regarding our capital expenditures.\nCertain Transactions\nThe following transactions occurred during the periods covered by this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations:\nOn June 21, 2016, Altice USA acquired Cablevision for a total purchase price of approximately $9,958,323. The Altice USA operating results include the operating results of Cablevision from the date of acquisition.\nIn July 2016, we completed the sale of a 75% interest in Newsday LLC and retained the remaining 25% ownership interest. Effective July 7, 2016, the operating results of Newsday are no longer consolidated with our results and our 25% interest in the operating results of Newsday is recorded on the equity basis.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net income (loss) excluding income taxes, income (loss) from discontinued operations, other non-operating income or expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing costs, gain (loss) on interest rate swap contracts, gain (loss) on derivative contracts, gain (loss) on investments, interest expense (including cash interest expense), interest income, depreciation and amortization (including impairments), share-based compensation expense or benefit, restructuring expense or credits and transaction expenses. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry. Internally, we use revenue and Adjusted EBITDA measures as important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides management and investors a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business and operating results by excluding items that are not comparable across reporting periods or that do not otherwise relate to the Company's ongoing operating results. Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), and other measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Since Adjusted EBITDA is not\na measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies.\nResults of Operations - Altice USA\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA:\n\n \n (a) Includes primarily dividends received on Comcast common stock owned by the Company. \n (b) Consists of unrealized and realized losses (gains) due to the change in the fair value of derivative contracts.  The following table sets forth certain customer metrics by segment (unaudited):\n\n \n (a) Represents the estimated number of single residence homes, apartments and condominium units passed by the cable distribution network in areas serviceable without further extending the transmission lines. In addition, it includes commercial establishments that have connected to our cable distribution network. For Cequel, broadband services were not available to approximately 100 homes passed and telephony services were not available to approximately 500 homes passed. \n (b) Represents number of households/businesses that receive at least one of the Company's services. \n (c) Customers represent each customer account (set up and segregated by customer name and address), weighted equally and counted as one customer, regardless of size, revenue generated, or number of boxes, units, or outlets. In calculating the number of customers, we count all customers other than inactive/disconnected customers. Free accounts are included in the customer counts along with all active accounts, but they are limited to a prescribed group. Most of these accounts are also not entirely free, as they typically generate revenue through pay-per-view or other pay services and certain equipment fees. Free status is not granted to regular customers as a promotion. In counting bulk residential customers, such as an \napartment building, we count each subscribing family unit within the building as one customer, but do not count the master account for the entire building as a customer. We count a bulk commercial customer, such as a hotel, as one customer, and do not count individual room units at that hotel.\n (d) Represents the number of customers that subscribe to three of our services divided by total residential customer relationships. \n (e) Represents the number of total customer relationships divided by homes passed. \n (f) Calculated by dividing the average monthly revenue for the respective quarter (fourth quarter for annual periods) derived from the sale of broadband, pay television and telephony services to residential customers for the respective quarter by the average number of total residential customers for the same period. \n\nAltice USA - Comparison of Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nPay Television Revenue\nPay television revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $4,214,745 and $2,759,216, respectively, of which $3,113,238 and $1,638,691 was derived from the Cablevision segment and $1,101,507 and $1,120,525 relates to our Cequel segment, respectively. Pay television is derived principally through monthly charges to residential customers of our pay television services. Revenue increases are derived primarily from rate increases, increases in the number of customers, including additional services sold to our existing customers, and programming package upgrades.\nPay television revenue for our Cablevision segment increased $1,474,547 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to the consolidation of the Cablevision results as of June 21, 2016, the date of the Cablevision Acquisition. Our 2016 results do not include pay television revenue\nof $1,468,006 recognized by Cablevision for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016. Pay television revenue was also impacted by rate increases for certain video services implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2017, an increase in late fees and an increase in pay-per-view revenue. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in revenue as compared to the prior year due to a decline in pay television customers.\nPay television revenue for our Cequel segment decreased $19,018 (2%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was due primarily to a decline in the number of pay television customers and a decrease in premium video services revenue, partially offset by certain rate increases, and an increase in late fees.\nWe believe our pay television customer declines noted in the table above are largely attributable to competition, particularly from Verizon in our Cablevision footprint and DBS providers in our Cequel footprint, as well as competition from companies that deliver video content over the Internet directly to customers. These factors are expected to continue to impact our ability to maintain or increase our existing customers and revenue in the future.\nBroadband Revenue\nBroadband revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $2,563,772 and $1,617,029, respectively, of which $1,603,015 and $782,615 was derived from our Cablevision segment and $960,757 and $834,414 was derived from our Cequel segment. Broadband revenue is derived principally through monthly charges to residential customers of our broadband services. Revenue increases are derived primarily from rate increases, increases in the number of customers, including additional services sold to our existing customers, and speed tier upgrades.\nBroadband revenue for our Cablevision segment increased $820,400 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to the consolidation of the Cablevision results as of June 21, 2016, the date of the Cablevision Acquisition. Our 2016 results do not include broadband revenue of $673,010 recognized by Cablevision for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016. Broadband revenue also increased $147,390 as a result of higher average recurring broadband revenue per broadband customer (driven by rate increases, the impact of service level changes, and an increase in late fees) and an increase in broadband customers.\nBroadband revenue for our Cequel segment increased $126,343 (15%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was due primarily to higher average recurring broadband revenue per broadband customer (driven by rate increases, the impact of service level changes, and an increase in late fees) and an increase in broadband customers.\nTelephony Revenue\nTelephony revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $823,981 and $529,973 of which $693,478 and $376,034 was derived from the Cablevision segment and $130,503 and $153,939 was derived from our Cequel segment. Telephony revenue is derived principally through monthly charges to residential customers of our telephony services. Revenue increases are derived primarily from rate increases, increases in the number of customers, and additional services sold to our existing customers.\nTelephony revenue for our Cablevision segment increased $317,444 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to the consolidation of the Cablevision results as of June 21, 2016, the date of the Cablevision Acquisition. Our 2016 results do not include telephony revenue of $342,142 recognized by Cablevision for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016. Offsetting this increase was a net decrease of $24,698 due primarily to lower average revenue per telephony customer and a decline in international calling.\nTelephony revenue for our Cequel segment decreased $23,436 (15%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was due primarily to lower average revenue per telephony customer and a decline in telephony customers.\nBusiness Services and Wholesale Revenue\nBusiness services and wholesale revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $1,298,817 and $819,541, respectively of which $923,161 and $468,632 was derived from the Cablevision segment and $375,656 and $350,909 was derived from our Cequel segment. Business services and wholesale revenue is derived primarily from the sale of fiber based telecommunications services to the business market, and the sale of broadband, pay television and telephony services to SMB customers.\nBusiness services and wholesale revenue for our Cablevision segment increased $454,529 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to the consolidation of the Cablevision results as of June 21, 2016, the date of the Cablevision Acquisition. Our 2016 results do not include revenue of $411,102 recognized by Cablevision for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016. Business services revenue also increased $43,427 primarily due to higher average recurring telephony and broadband revenue per SMB customer and an increase in\nEthernet revenue resulting from a larger number of services installed, partially offset by reduced traditional voice and data services for commercial customers.\nBusiness services and wholesale revenue for our Cequel segment increased $24,747 (7%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher commercial rates and customers for broadband services, an increase in certain pay television rates and increases in commercial carrier services.\nAdvertising Revenue\nAdvertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, net of inter-segment revenue, was $391,866 and $252,049, respectively, of which $321,149 and $163,678 was derived from our Cablevision segment and $73,509 and $88,371 was derived from our Cequel segment. Advertising revenue is primarily derived from the sale of advertising time available on the programming carried on our cable television systems.\nAdvertising revenue for our Cablevision segment increased $157,471 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.

The remaining increase in advertising revenue of $32,052 was due primarily to an increase in digital advertising revenue and an increase in data and analytics revenue, partially offset by a decrease in political advertising.\nAdvertising revenue for our Cequel segment decreased $14,862 (17%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is due to declines in political, auto, retail, and restaurant advertising.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $33,389 and $39,404, respectively, of which $10,747 and $14,402 was derived from our Cablevision segment and $22,642 and $25,002 was derived from our Cequel segment. Other revenue includes other miscellaneous revenue streams.\nProgramming and Other Direct Costs\nProgramming and other direct costs, net of intersegment eliminations, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 amounted to $3,035,655 and $1,911,230, respectively, of which $2,280,062 and $1,164,925 relate to our Cablevision segment and $758,190 and $746,305 relate to our Cequel segment. Programming and other direct costs include cable programming costs, which are costs paid to programmers (net of amortization of any incentives received from programmers for carriage) for cable content (including costs of VOD and pay-per-view) and are generally paid on a per-customer basis. These costs typically rise due to increases in contractual rates and new channel launches and are also impacted by changes in the number of customers receiving certain programming services. These costs also include interconnection, call completion, circuit and transport fees paid to other telecommunication companies for the transport and termination of voice and data services, which typically vary based on rate changes and the level of usage by our customers. These costs also include franchise fees which are payable to the state governments and local municipalities", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

We disclaim any obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements contained herein, except as otherwise required by applicable federal securities laws.\nCertain numerical figures included in this annual report have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, such numerical figures shown as totals in various tables may not be arithmetic aggregations of the figures that precede them.\nOverview\nAll dollar amounts, except per customer and per share data, included in the following discussion, are presented in thousands.\nOur Business\nWe deliver broadband, pay television, telephony services, Wi-Fi hotspot access, proprietary content and advertising services to approximately 4.9 million residential and business customers. Our footprint extends across 21 states through a fiber-rich broadband network with approximately 8.6 million homes passed as of December 31, 2017. We have two reportable segments: Cablevision and Cequel. Cablevision provides broadband, pay television and telephony services to residential and business customers in and around the New York metropolitan area. Cequel provides broadband, pay television and telephony services to residential and business customers in the south-central United States, with the majority of its customers located in the ten states of Texas, West Virginia, Louisiana, Arkansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Arizona, California, Missouri and Ohio.\nKey Factors Impacting Operating Results and Financial Condition\nOur future performance is dependent, to a large extent, on the impact of direct competition, general economic conditions (including capital and credit market conditions), our ability to manage our businesses effectively, and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace, both with suppliers and customers. For more information see Risk Factors\u201d and Business-Competition\u201d included herein.\nWe derive revenue principally through monthly charges to residential customers of our pay television, broadband, and telephony services. We also derive revenue from equipment rental, DVR, VOD, pay-per-view, installation and home shopping commissions. Our residential pay television, broadband, and telephony services accounted for approximately 45%, 27% and 9%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. We also derive revenue from the sale of a wide and growing variety of products and services to both large enterprise and SMB customers, including broadband, telephony, networking and pay television services. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 14% of our consolidated revenue was derived from these business services. In addition, we derive revenues from the sale of advertising time available on the programming carried on our cable television systems, which accounted for approximately 4% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated revenue.\nRevenue increases are derived from rate increases, increases in the number of customers to our services, including additional services sold to our existing customers, programming package upgrades by our pay television customers, speed tier upgrades by our broadband customers, and acquisitions of cable systems that result in the addition of new customers.\nOur ability to increase the number of customers to our services is significantly related to our penetration rates.\nWe operate in a highly competitive consumer-driven industry and we compete against a variety of broadband, pay television and telephony providers and delivery systems, including broadband communications companies, wireless data and telephony providers, satellite-delivered video signals, Internet-delivered video content and broadcast television signals available to residential and business customers in our service areas. Our competitors include AT&T and its DirecTV subsidiary, CenturyLink, DISH Network, Frontier and Verizon. Consumers' selection of an alternate source of service, whether due to economic constraints, technological advances or preference, negatively impacts the demand for our services. For more information on our competitive landscape, see Risk Factors\u201d and Business-Competition\u201d included herein.\nOur programming costs, which are the most significant component of our operating expenses, have increased and are expected to continue to increase primarily as a result of contractual rate increases and new channel launches. See -Results of Operations\u201d below for more information regarding our key factors impacting our revenues and operating expenses.\nHistorically, we have made substantial investments in our network and the development of new and innovative products and other service offerings for our customers as a way of differentiating ourselves from our competitors and may continue to do so in the future. We have commenced a five-year plan to build a FTTH network, which will enable us to deliver more than 10 Gbps broadband speeds across our entire Optimum footprint and part of our Suddenlink footprint. We may incur greater than anticipated capital expenditures in connection with this initiative, fail to realize anticipated benefits, experience delays and business disruptions or encounter other challenges to executing it as planned. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Capital Expenditures\u201d for additional information regarding our capital expenditures.\nCertain Transactions\nThe following transactions occurred during the periods covered by this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations:\nOn June 21, 2016, Altice USA acquired Cablevision for a total purchase price of approximately $9,958,323. The Altice USA operating results include the operating results of Cablevision from the date of acquisition.\nIn July 2016, we completed the sale of a 75% interest in Newsday LLC and retained the remaining 25% ownership interest. Effective July 7, 2016, the operating results of Newsday are no longer consolidated with our results and our 25% interest in the operating results of Newsday is recorded on the equity basis.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net income (loss) excluding income taxes, income (loss) from discontinued operations, other non-operating income or expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing costs, gain (loss) on interest rate swap contracts, gain (loss) on derivative contracts, gain (loss) on investments, interest expense (including cash interest expense), interest income, depreciation and amortization (including impairments), share-based compensation expense or benefit, restructuring expense or credits and transaction expenses. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry. Internally, we use revenue and Adjusted EBITDA measures as important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides management and investors a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business and operating results by excluding items that are not comparable across reporting periods or that do not otherwise relate to the Company's ongoing operating results. Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), and other measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Since Adjusted EBITDA is not\na measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies.\nResults

In addition, it includes commercial establishments that have connected to our cable distribution network. For Cequel, broadband services were not available to approximately 100 homes passed and telephony services were not available to approximately 500 homes passed. \n (b) Represents number of households/businesses that receive at least one of the Company's services. \n (c) Customers represent each customer account (set up and segregated by customer name and address), weighted equally and counted as one customer, regardless of size, revenue generated, or number of boxes, units, or outlets. In calculating the number of customers, we count all customers other than inactive/disconnected customers. Free accounts are included in the customer counts along with all active accounts, but they are limited to a prescribed group. Most of these accounts are also not entirely free, as they typically generate revenue through pay-per-view or other pay services and certain equipment fees. Free status is not granted to regular customers as a promotion. In counting bulk residential customers, such as an \napartment building, we count each subscribing family unit within the building as one customer, but do not count the master account for the entire building as a customer. We count a bulk commercial customer, such as a hotel, as one customer, and do not count individual room units at that hotel.\n (d) Represents the number of customers that subscribe to three of our services divided by total residential customer relationships. \n (e) Represents the number of total customer relationships divided by homes passed. \n (f) Calculated by dividing the average monthly revenue for the respective quarter (fourth quarter for annual periods) derived from the sale of broadband, pay television and telephony services to residential customers for the respective quarter by the average number of total residential customers for the same period. \nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

2016\nPay Television Revenue\nPay television revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $4,214,745 and $2,759,216, respectively, of which $3,113,238 and $1,638,691 was derived from the Cablevision segment and $1,101,507 and $1,120,525 relates to our Cequel segment, respectively. Pay television is derived principally through monthly charges to residential customers of our pay television services. Revenue increases are derived primarily from rate increases, increases in the number of customers, including additional services sold to our existing customers, and programming package upgrades.\nPay television revenue for our Cablevision segment increased $1,474,547 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to the consolidation of the Cablevision results as of June 21, 2016, the date of the Cablevision Acquisition. Our 2016 results do not include pay television revenue\nof $1,468,006 recognized by Cablevision for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016. Pay television revenue was also impacted by rate increases for certain video services implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2017, an increase in late fees and an increase in pay-per-view revenue. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in revenue as compared to the prior year due to a decline in pay television customers.\nPay television revenue for our Cequel segment decreased $19,018 (2%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was due primarily to a decline in the number of pay television customers and a decrease in premium video services revenue, partially offset by certain rate increases, and an increase in late fees.\nWe believe our pay television customer declines noted in the table above are largely attributable to competition, particularly from Verizon in our Cablevision footprint and DBS providers in our Cequel footprint, as well as competition from companies that deliver video content over the Internet directly to customers. These factors are expected to continue to impact our ability to maintain or increase our existing customers and revenue in the future.\nBroadband Revenue\nBroadband revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $2,563,772 and $1,617,029, respectively, of which $1,603,015 and $782,615 was derived from our Cablevision segment and $960,757 and $834,414 was derived from our Cequel segment. Broadband revenue is derived principally through monthly charges to residential customers of our broadband services. Revenue increases are derived primarily from rate increases, increases in the number of customers, including additional services sold to our existing customers, and speed tier upgrades.\nBroadband revenue for our Cablevision segment increased $820,400 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to the consolidation of the Cablevision results as of June 21, 2016, the date of the Cablevision Acquisition. Our 2016 results do not include broadband revenue of $673,010 recognized by Cablevision for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016. Broadband revenue also increased $147,390 as a result of higher average recurring broadband revenue per broadband customer (driven by rate increases, the impact of service level changes, and an increase in late fees) and an increase in broadband customers.\nBroadband revenue for our Cequel segment increased $126,343 (15%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was due primarily to higher average recurring broadband revenue per broadband customer (driven by rate increases, the impact of service level changes, and an increase in late fees) and an increase in broadband customers.\nTelephony Revenue\nTelephony revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $823,981 and $529,973 of which $693,478 and $376,034 was derived from the Cablevision segment and $130,503 and $153,939 was derived from our Cequel segment. Telephony revenue is derived principally through monthly charges to residential customers of our telephony services. Revenue increases are derived primarily from rate increases, increases in the number of customers, and additional services sold to our existing customers.\nTelephony revenue for our Cablevision segment increased $317,444 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to the consolidation of the Cablevision results as of June 21, 2016, the date of the Cablevision Acquisition. Our 2016 results do not include telephony revenue of $342,142 recognized by Cablevision for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016. Offsetting this increase was a net decrease of $24,698 due primarily to lower average revenue per telephony customer and a decline in international calling.\nTelephony revenue for our Cequel segment decreased $23,436 (15%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was due primarily to lower average revenue per telephony customer and a decline in telephony customers.\nBusiness Services and Wholesale Revenue\nBusiness services and wholesale revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $1,298,817 and $819,541, respectively of which $923,161 and $468,632 was derived from the Cablevision segment and $375,656 and $350,909 was derived from our Cequel segment. Business services and wholesale revenue is derived primarily from the sale of fiber based telecommunications services to the business market, and the sale of broadband, pay television and telephony services to SMB customers.\nBusiness services and wholesale revenue for our Cablevision segment increased $454,529 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to the consolidation of the Cablevision results as of June 21, 2016, the date of the Cablevision Acquisition. Our 2016 results do not include revenue of $411,102 recognized by Cablevision for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016. Business services revenue also increased $43,427 primarily due to higher average recurring telephony and broadband revenue per SMB customer and an increase in\nEthernet revenue resulting from a larger number of services installed, partially offset by reduced traditional voice and data services for commercial customers.\nBusiness services and wholesale revenue for our Cequel segment increased $24,747 (7%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher commercial rates and customers for broadband services, an increase in certain pay television rates and increases in commercial carrier services.\nAdvertising Revenue\nAdvertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, net of inter-segment revenue, was $391,866 and $252,049, respectively, of which $321,149 and $163,678 was derived from our Cablevision segment and $73,509 and $88,371 was derived from our Cequel segment. Advertising revenue is primarily derived from the sale of advertising time available on the programming carried on our cable television systems.\nAdvertising revenue for our Cablevision segment increased $157,471 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to the consolidation of the Cablevision results as of June 21, 2016, the date of the Cablevision Acquisition. Our 2016 results do not include advertising revenue of $125,419 recognized by Cablevision for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016. The remaining increase in advertising revenue of $32,052 was due primarily to an increase in digital advertising revenue and an increase in data and analytics revenue, partially offset by a decrease in political advertising.\nAdvertising revenue for our Cequel segment decreased $14,862 (17%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is due to declines in political, auto, retail, and restaurant advertising.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $33,389 and $39,404, respectively, of which $10,747 and $14,402 was derived from our Cablevision segment and $22,642 and $25,002 was derived from our Cequel segment. Other revenue includes other miscellaneous revenue streams.\nProgramming and Other Direct Costs\nProgramming and other direct costs, net of intersegment eliminations, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 amounted to $3,035,655 and $1,911,230, respectively, of which $2,280,062 and $1,164,925 relate to our Cablevision segment and $758,190 and $746,305 relate to our Cequel segment. Programming and other direct costs include cable programming costs, which are costs paid to programmers (net of amortization of any incentives received from programmers for carriage) for cable content (including costs of VOD and pay-per-view) and are generally paid on a per-customer basis. These costs typically rise due to increases in contractual rates and new channel launches and are also impacted by changes in the number of customers receiving certain programming services. These costs also include interconnection, call completion, circuit and transport fees paid to other telecommunication companies for the transport and termination of voice and data services, which typically vary based on rate changes and the level of usage by our customers. These costs also include franchise fees which are payable to the state governments and local municipalities"}
