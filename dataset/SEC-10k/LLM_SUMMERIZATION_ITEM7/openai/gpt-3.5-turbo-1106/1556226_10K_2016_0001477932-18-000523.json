MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe following management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes thereto. The management's discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. When used, the words \"believe,\" \"plan,\" \"intend,\" \"anticipate,\" \"target,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect\" and the like, and/or future tense or conditional constructions (\"will,\" \"may,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" etc.), or similar expressions, identify certain of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those under \"Risk Factors,\" above, that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Annual Report.\nReferences in this section to \"C\u00dcR Media,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" \"the Company\" and \"our Company\" refer to C\u00dcR Media, Inc., and its consolidated subsidiary, C\u00dcR Media, LLC (formerly Raditaz, LLC).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe following discussion highlights the our results of operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described, and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the statements of financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The financial information contained herein has been retroactivity adjusted for a reverse stock split at the rate of 1-for-13, which we effected on February 16, 2016. The following discussion and analysis are based on our audited financial statements contained in this Annual Report, which we have prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. You should read the discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto.\nAs a result of the Contribution and the related change in our business and operations, a discussion of our past financial results is not pertinent, and under applicable accounting principles the historical financial results of C\u00dcR Media, LLC (formerly Raditaz, LLC), the accounting acquirer, prior to the Contribution are considered the historical financial results of the Company.\nThe audited financial statements included in this Annual Report include a summary of our significant accounting policies, and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations for such periods have been included in these audited financial statements. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.\nGeneral Overview\nWe were incorporated in the State of Delaware as Duane Street Corp. on November 17, 2011. Our original business was manufacturing and marketing baby products. Prior to the Contribution (as defined below), our Board of Directors determined to discontinue operations in this area and to seek a new business opportunity.\nOn January 28, 2014, we consummated the Contribution with C\u00dcR Media, LLC, a limited liability company organized in the State of Connecticut on February 15, 2008, pursuant to a Contribution Agreement by and among the Company, C\u00dcR Media, LLC, and the holders of a majority of C\u00dcR Media, LLC's limited liability company membership interests (the \"Contribution Agreement\"). In connection with the Contribution, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Contribution Agreement, all outstanding securities of C\u00dcR Media, LLC were exchanged for securities of ours.\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>51 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nC\u00dcR Media, LLC's activities since inception were devoted primarily to the development and commercialization of Raditaz, a DMCA compliant internet radio product. Raditaz was launched in early 2012 and the platform was continually developed and improved through November 2013 when its iOS, Android and web products were removed from the market, to allow us to focus on the further development of our C\u00dcR Music product.\nThe Raditaz music streaming platform and products were under development since 2010 and, prior to the 2014 PPO (as defined below) were financed primarily from angel investments in the aggregate amount of approximately $4,858,000, $150,000 of financing from a promissory note from CT Innovations, Incorporated, and a $100,000 promissory note and a $100,000 grant from the State of Connecticut Department of Economic Development.\nAs a result of the Contribution, C\u00dcR Media, LLC became our wholly owned subsidiary, and we adopted the business of C\u00dcR Media, LLC, which is to develop and commercialize a streaming music experience for listening on the web and mobile devices, as our sole line of business.\nOn January 31, 2014, we changed our name to C\u00dcR Media, Inc., a name that more accurately represents our new business focus. In connection with the name change, we changed our OTC trading symbol to \"CURM.\"\nIn addition, on January 31, 2014, we increased our number of authorized shares to 310,000,000 shares, consisting of (i) 300,000,000 shares of Common Stock, and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share.\nFurther, on January 31, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a 1.26953123-for-1 forward split of our Common Stock, in the form of a dividend, pursuant to which each shareholder of our Common Stock as of the record date received 1.19260815 additional shares of Common Stock for each one share owned.\nIn a private placement financing we conducted with respect to which closings occurred on January 28, 2014, March 14, 2014 and March 28, 2014 (the \"2014 PPO\"), we sold an aggregate of 744,756 shares of our Common Stock, and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 744,756 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $26.00 per share for a term of five (5) years (\"PPO Warrants\"), for gross proceeds of approximately $9,680,000 (before deducting placement agent fees and expenses of the 2014 PPO estimated at approximately $1,529,000).\nThe placement agent for the 2014 PPO and its sub-agent were paid an aggregate commission of approximately $968,000 and were issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 74,483 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $13.00 per share for a term of five (5) years (\"Broker Warrants\").\nOn April 6, 2015, we consummated an offer to amend and exercise the PPO Warrants (the \"Offer to Amend and Exercise Warrants\"). The PPO Warrants of holders who elected to participate in the Offer to Amend and Exercise Warrants were amended to, among other things, remove the price-based anti-dilution provisions contained therein and reduce the exercise price from $26.00 to $6.50 per share of Common Stock. Pursuant to the Offer to Amend and Exercise Warrants, an aggregate of 497,548 PPO Warrants were amended and exercised by their holders, for gross proceeds of approximately $3,234,000 (before deducting warrant agent fees and expenses of the Offer to Amend and Exercise estimated at approximately $417,000).\nEffective on or prior to April 6, 2015, the Company and the holders of (a) 113,469 PPO Warrants, that chose not to participate in the Offer to Amend and Exercise Warrants (\"Non-Participating Original Warrants\"), and (b) all 74,483 Broker Warrants, approved an amendment to remove the price-based anti-dilution provisions in their warrants. As a result, the price-based anti-dilution provisions contained in these Non-Participating Original Warrants and Broker Warrants have been removed and are of no further force or effect as of April 6, 2015.\nThe warrant agent for the Offer to Amend and Exercise Warrants was paid an aggregate commission of approximately $323,350 and was issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 49,752 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $6.50 per share for a term of five (5) years (\"Warrant Agent Warrants\").\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>52 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertain securities we issued in the 2014 PPO had price-based anti-dilution protection, if, within twenty-four (24) months after the final closing of the 2014 PPO, we issued additional shares of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents (subject to customary exceptions) for a consideration per share less than $13.00. Of the 744,756 PPO Warrants, 133,739 still had these priced-based anti-dilution rights through March 28, 2016. With the consummation of the exercise and amendment of the PPO Warrants and the issuance of the Warrant Agent Warrants to the Warrant Agent, the anti-dilution provisions were triggered and the non-participating warrant holders received: (i) an aggregate of 17,180 additional shares of Common Stock (ii) a reduction in the price of their PPO Warrants from $26.00 per share to $23.01 per share, and (iii) an aggregate of 17,180 additional warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company at an exercise price of $23.01 per share.\nOn October 20, 2015, October 26, 2015, November 13, 2015, November 24, 2015, November 30, 2015, December 30, 2015 and January 14, 2016 we entered into Securities Purchase Agreements (in this case, the \"Purchase Agreements\") with certain \"accredited investors (the \"Unsecured Buyers\"), pursuant to which the Unsecured Buyers purchased 12% Unsecured Convertible Promissory Notes of the Company (the \"Unsecured Notes\") in the aggregate principal amount of $2,113,500 (the \"First Convertible Note Offering\"). The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company were $2,113,500 (before deducting expenses related to the purchase and sale of the Unsecured Notes of approximately $45,000), of which $586,000 in proceeds were from members of the Board of Directors.\nWith the issuance of Unsecured Notes, the Anti-Dilution Rights were triggered and the holders of the Non-Participating Original Warrants received, or are entitled to receive: (i) an aggregate of 18,674 additional shares of Common Stock, (ii) a reduction in the price of their PPO Warrants from $23.01 per share to $20.50 per share, and (iii) an aggregate of 18,674 additional warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company at an exercise price of $20.50 per share.\nOn February 16, 2016, we effected a 1-for-13 reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split\u201d). Upon effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split, every thirteen (13) outstanding shares of our Common Stock (\"Old Common Stock\") were, without any further action by us, or any holder thereof, combined into and automatically became one (1) share of our Common Stock. Any fractional shares have been rounded up to one whole common share. All shares of Common Stock eliminated as a result of the Reverse Stock Split have been cancelled such that they were returned to our authorized and unissued capital stock, and our capital has been reduced by an amount equal to the par value of the Old Common Stock so retired.\nOn April 12, 2016, April 15, 2016, May 26, 2016, June 7, 2016 and July 20, 2016 the Company entered into Securities Purchase Agreements (in this case, the \"Purchase Agreements\") with certain \"accredited investors\" (the \"Secured Buyers\"), pursuant to which the Secured Buyers purchased 12% Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes of the Company (the \"Secured Notes\") in the aggregate principal amount of $2,515,000 (before deducting placement agent fees and expenses of $282,454) (the \"Second Convertible Note Offering\").\nThe Company used the net proceeds from the Second Convertible Note Offering for certain payments to content owners, and working capital and general corporate purposes.\nThe Secured Notes are secured by a security interest in and lien on all now owned or hereafter acquired assets and property, real and personal, of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Company's intellectual and technology property pursuant to the terms of a security agreement (in this case, the \"Security Agreement\") among the Company and the Secured Buyers. The security interest in and liens on all assets and property of the Company will be a first priority security interest.\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>53 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Secured Notes have an aggregate principal balance of $2,515,000, and a stated maturity date of 6 months from the date of issuance. The principal on the Secured Notes bears interest at a rate of 12% per annum, which is also payable on maturity. The Secured Notes will rank senior to all existing indebtedness of the Company, except as otherwise set forth in the Secured Notes. Upon the closing of a financing (in this case, a \"Qualified Offering\") by the Company during the term of the Secured Notes involving the sale of at least $15,000,000 in Equity Financing Securities, all of the outstanding principal amount of the Secured Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest due thereon, will automatically convert (in this case, a \"Mandatory Conversion\") into units of the Company's securities (the \"Second Units\") at a conversion price per Second Unit equal to the lesser of (a) 80% of the price per share of the Equity Financing Securities sold in the Qualified Offering, or (b) $2.00. At any time prior to a Mandatory Conversion, the holders of the Secured Notes may convert all or part of the outstanding principal amount of the Secured Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest due thereon, into Second Units at a conversion price of $2.00 per Unit (in this case, an \"Optional Conversion\"). Each Second Unit will consists of one share (the \"Second Unit Shares\") of the Company's Common Stock, and one five-year warrant (the \"Second Unit Warrants\") to purchase one additional share (the \"Second Unit Warrant Shares\") of the Company's Common Stock at an exercise price equal to (a) 125% of the price at which the Company's equity securities (or securities convertible into or exercisable for equity securities) are sold in a Qualified Offering in the event of a Mandatory Conversion, or (b) 125% of $2.00 in the event of an Optional Conversion. Upon failure by the Company to pay any principal amount or interest due under the Secured Notes within 5 days of the date such payment is due, or the occurrence of other event of default under the terms of the Secured Notes, the entire unpaid principal balance of the Secured Notes, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, will become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each holder of a Secured Note will be entitled to receive, pari passu with the other holders of the Secured Notes, and in preference to the holders of the Company's other outstanding securities, an amount equal to two times the principal amount of, and any accrued and unpaid interest on, such holder's Secured Note. The conversion price and number of Second Units issuable upon conversion of the Secured Notes will be subject to adjustment from time to time for subdivision or consolidation of shares and other standard dilutive events.\nPursuant to the terms of a Placement Agency Agreement (in this case, the \"Placement Agency Agreement\") between the Company and the placement agent for the Second Convertible Note Offering (in this case, the \"Placement Agent\"), in connection with the closing of the Second Convertible Note Offering, the Placement Agent was paid a commission of an aggregate of $236,500. In addition, the Placement Agent, or its designees, received warrants to purchase a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 10% of the number of Second Unit Shares into which Secured Notes sold in the Second Convertible Note Offering to Secured Buyers introduced to the Second Convertible Note Offering by the Placement Agent, and 8% of the number of Second Unit Shares into which Secured Notes sold in the Second Convertible Note Offering to Secured Buyers introduced to the Second Convertible Note Offering by the Company or its representatives, are converted upon a Mandatory Conversion, with a term of 5 years and an exercise price per share equal to the exercise price of the Second Unit Warrant Shares issued to Secured Buyers introduced to the Second Convertible Note Offering by the Placement Agent upon a Mandatory Conversion (\"Placement Agent Warrants\").\nThe Second Unit Warrants, to be received upon conversion of the Secured Notes, provide for the purchase of shares of the Company's Common Stock an exercise price equal to (a) 125% of the price at which the Company's Equity Financing Securities are sold in a Qualified Offering in the event of a Mandatory Conversion, or (b) 125% of $2.00 in the event of an Optional Conversion. The Second Unit Warrants are exercisable for cash only, for a term of five (5) years from the date of issuance. The number of shares of Common Stock to be deliverable upon exercise of the Second Unit Warrants is subject to adjustment for subdivision or consolidation of shares and other standard dilutive events.\nThe Company granted registration rights to each Secured Buyer with respect to the Second Unit Shares and Second Unit Warrant Shares, and to the Placement Agent, with respect to the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Placement Agent Warrants, in each case on a pari passu basis with, and upon substantially the same terms as the registration rights granted to, the investors in a Qualified Offering.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had devoted substantially all of our efforts to product development, raising capital and building our technology infrastructure. As of that date, we did not receive any revenues from our planned principal operations.\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>54 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Strategy\nOur C\u00dcR Music product is a new streaming music experience that combines the listening experience of free internet radio products with an on-demand listening experience for listening on web and mobile devices, beginning at $1.99 per month. C\u00dcR Music will target consumers who are seeking a more comprehensive music streaming service than current free, ad-supported music streaming products. We believe that the C\u00dcR Music product will include a hybrid model that includes many features that free, ad-supported internet radio products provide, without interruptive advertising, with a limited on-demand offering, and will include a social toolset that enables consumers to curate certain aspects their playlists.\nIn addition to revenue from subscriptions, our business plan includes a second revenue stream of personalized advertising, which will not interrupt a stream, but will target a user's listening habits. The advertising may be in the form of, display ads, email and text messages. Our business plan further includes a third revenue stream from the sale of music, concert tickets and merchandise through our music streaming service, to be tailored to each listeners taste based on prior listening trends. We plan to sell advertising, music downloads and concert tickets and merchandise in the future subsequent to launch.\nIn addition, our business plan includes distributing our music streaming service through Apple's iTunes App Store to iOS devices, Google's Google Play Store to Android devices and the internet, among other distribution channels and platforms. At launch, we plan to have an iOS application, Android application and a C\u00dcR Music website.\nWe plan to source our music from MusicNet, Inc. d/b/a Media Net Digital, Inc. We also plan to use Amazon web services to support certain of the technological needs of the business.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we continued to pursue sources of equity and/or debt financing to support our operations. We were not successful in raising the necessary funds as of December 31, 2016. We cannot launch our music streaming product and platform until we have raised the necessary funds.\nRecent Developments\nDefaults under Agreements with Content Providers\nAs previously reported, the Company had entered into Music Label Agreements with certain Music Labels, pursuant to which the Company was provided limited, non-exclusive licenses to digitally distribute certain sound recordings and related materials owned or controlled by the Music Labels in connection with the Company's C\u00dcR-branded Internet music service, C\u00dcR Music, to be composed of three progressively priced and increasingly functional tiers, within the United States and its territories, commonwealths, and possessions. The Company had also entered into Publishing Agreements with certain Music Publishers either directly or through a third party, pursuant to which the Company had been provided the non-exclusive right and license to use certain musical works owned, controlled and/or administered by the Music Publishers in connection with C\u00dcR Music, within the United States and its territories, commonwealths, and possessions. The Music Label Agreements and Publishing Agreements may be collectively referred to herein as the \"Content Agreements,\" and the Music Labels and Music Publishers may be collectively referred to herein as the \"Content Providers.\u201d\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>55 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPursuant to the Content Agreements, the Company was required to pay certain minimum content fees over the term of the Content Agreements as follows: $14,000,000 in the first year of the agreements, of which approximately $8,000,000 was due on January 31, 2016, $25,500,000 in the second year of the agreements, and $18,500,000 in the third year of the agreements. The Content Providers previously agreed to provide the Company additional time to make the $8,000,000 in payments through both oral and written agreements. Under those agreements, the Company had until June 15, 2016 to make such payments. The Company paid an aggregate of $500,000 of the proceeds from the closing of the Secured Notes to the Content Providers.\nOn September 20, 2016, our Music Label Agreements with SME and UMG were terminated as a result of our failure to pay SME and UMG the advances due pursuant to such agreements. The Company also defaulted on its Music Label Agreement with WMG as a result of its failure to pay WMG the advance due pursuant to such agreement.\nThe Company issued the Content Providers warrants (\"Content Provider Warrants\") to purchase an aggregate of 215,279 shares (the \"Content Provider Warrant Shares\") of the Company's Common Stock at a weighted average exercise price of $6.41 per share. The Content Provider Warrants have a weighted average contractual term of 6.45 years. The exercise price and number of Content Provider Warrant Shares are subject to adjustment for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or other similar event.\nDefault on Secured Notes\nOn October 12, 2016, October 15, 2016, November 26, 2016, December 7, 2016, December 20, 2016 and January 20, 2017, the principal and any accrued and unpaid interest on our outstanding Secured Notes in the principal amount of an aggregate of $2,515,000 became due and payable. We were unable to repay the noteholders at that time. Pursuant to the terms of the Secured Notes, our failure to pay any principal or interest within five (5) days of the date such payment was due constituted an event of default. Following the occurrence of an event of default, among other things, the interest rate on the Secured Notes increased to 15%. In addition to other remedies available to the noteholders, our obligation to repay amounts due under the Secured Notes is secured by a first priority security interest in and lien on all of our assets and property, including our intellectual property.\nSimultaneously with the Initial Closing (as defined below) of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering (as defined below), the holder of the Secured Note (the Secured Noteholders\u201d) assigned, conveyed, transferred and set over to CUR Holdings all of the Secured Noteholders' right, title, interest and obligations in, to and under the Secured Notes, and all claims, suits, causes of action and any other rights thereunder, to CUR Holdings. As a result, CUR Holdings became the sole payee under the Secured Notes.\nReceipt of Wells Notice\nOn July 19, 2017, we received a Wells Notice\u201d from the staff (the Staff\u201d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d). The Wells Notice provides notification to the Company that the Staff has made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC institute administrative proceedings against the Company pursuant to Sections 12(j) and 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d), based solely upon the Company's failure to comply with its reporting obligations under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act. Sections 12(j) grants the SEC the right, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, to revoke the registration of a security. Section 12(k) grants the SEC the right to suspend trading in a security.\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>56 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn accordance with SEC rules, on August 25, 2017, the Company made a written submission to the SEC in response to the Wells Notice, in which, among other things, it conveyed the Company's present intention to file the delinquent reports and become current with its SEC filing requirements and, as such, set forth the reasons why the proposed enforcement action should not be filed. While no assurances can be made, the Company believes that, as a result of making these filings, the SEC will have no further reason to institute the proposed administrative proceedings, or, if instituted, to continue such proceedings. However, there can be no assurance that the SEC will not bring an enforcement action against the Company, which could result in a trading suspension of the Company's Common Stock and the de-registration of the Company's securities under the Exchange Act. Administrative proceedings, if instituted, will be held before an administrative law judge.\nAt the time we received the Wells Notice, the Company had not filed its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC for the quarters ended June 30, 2016, September 30, 2016, March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017. The Company also had not filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of this filing, the remaining delinquent reports consist of the Company's Form 10-Qs for the quarters ended March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017.\nDefaults on Vendor Agreements\nAs of September 27, 2016, our Data License and Services Agreement (the \"Rovi Agreement\") with Rovi Data Solutions, Inc. and Veveo, Inc. (collectively, Rovi\u201d) terminated as a result of our failure to pay Rovi past due balances for the services they provided under the Rovi Agreement.\nWe are in default under our Distribution Agreement (the \"MediaNet Agreement\") with MusicNet, Inc., d/b/a MediaNet Digital, Inc. (\"MediaNet\") as a result of our failure to pay MediaNet past due balances for the services they provided under the MediaNet Agreement. To date, we have not received a notice of default from MediaNet. The Company intends to cure the default once it is adequately funded.\nOn October 12, 2016, we received a notice of default from Zuora, Inc. (\"Zuora\") confirming that the Company is in default under its Master Subscription Agreement with Zuora (the \"Zuora Agreement\") as a result of our failure to pay Zuora past due balances for the services they provided under the Zuora Agreement. The Company intends to cure the default once it is adequately funded.\nWe are in default under our Sponsorship Agreement (the \"Live Nation Agreement\") with Live Nation Marketing, Inc. (\"Live Nation\") as a result of the Company's failure to pay Live Nation past due balances for the services they provided under the Live Nation Agreement. To date, we have not received a notice of default from Live Nation. The Company intends to cure the default once it is adequately funded.\nAs of this date, we are in default of all of our vendor agreements as a result of not making the required payments.\nSix-Month Line of Credit Promissory Note\nOn July 6, 2017, we entered into a Six-Month Line of Credit Promissory Note (the Line of Credit Note\u201d) with CUR Holdings, LLC, a New York limited liability company. The Line of Credit Note has a principal balance of $685,000, and a stated maturity date of December 6, 2017. The principal on the Line of Credit Note does not bear interest. The Line of Credit Note is not convertible. The Line of Credit Note ranks junior to the Company's existing Secured Notes.\nIn connection with the Initial Closing of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering (as defined below), the Line of Credit Note was assigned and transferred to CUR Holdings (as defined below). As a result, CUR Holdings became the payee under the Line of Credit Note.\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>57 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSettlement Agreement and Mutual Release\nAs previously reported, the Company defaulted under its Master Multiple Services Agreement (the Digitas Agreement\u201d) with Digitas, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation ( Digitas\u201d), as a result of the Company's failure to pay Digitas past due balances for the services Digitas provided under the Digitas Agreement. Digitas filed a claim against the Company for damages in the aggregate amount of $650,000 (the Claimed Amount\u201d), together with pre-judgment interest, post-judgment interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. On November 15, 2017, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (the Settlement Agreement\u201d) with Digitas, pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay Digitas an aggregate of $400,000, in full settlement of any and all claims arising from or relating to amounts due under the Master Multiple Services Agreement (the Claims\u201d). Digitas agreed to release the Company from any further Claims, subject only to the Company meeting its payment obligations under the Settlement Agreement and the Digitas Note (as defined below).\nSimultaneously with the execution of the Settlement Agreement, the Company issued a Promissory Note to Digitas (the Digitas Note\u201d) in the principal amount of $400,000. Pursuant to the Digitas Note, the Company is required to pay Digitas (a) $100,000 on or before November 17, 2017 (the First Payment\u201d), $100,000 on the eight (8) month anniversary of the First Payment, and (c) $200,000.00 on the one (1) year anniversary of the First Payment. If the Company defaults on its payment obligations under the Digitas Note, after notice and failure to cure, Digitas may file a Consent Judgment for the full Claimed Amount, less payments already made, if any, together with post-judgment interest and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred by Digitas for purposes of collection.\nAt the effective time of the Initial Closing of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering (as defined below), the Company made the First Payment of $100,000 to Digitas.\nTransactions and Proposed Additional Transactions with CUR Holdings, Inc.\nOn September 11, 2017, the Company entered into a term sheet (the Term Sheet\u201d) with CUR Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( CUR Holdings\u201d) pursuant to which the Company and CUR Holdings agreed to consummate either a Merger (as defined below) or an Asset Transfer (as defined below), under certain circumstances. Pursuant to the Term Sheet, in the event the Company receives notification from the SEC that it will not institute the proposed administrative proceedings, or, if instituted, will discontinue such proceedings ( SEC Clearance\u201d), CUR Holdings will, subject to any required shareholder approval, merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity (the Merger\u201d); provided, however, that the Board of Directors of the Company and CUR Holdings may mutually agree to proceed with the Merger prior to receipt of SEC Clearance.

CUR Holdings, LLC, in the principal amount of $315,000 (the Standard Holdings Note\u201d and, together with the Line of Credit Note, the Assigned Notes\u201d), which assignment and transfer counted towards the achievement of the $6,000,000 Minimum Amount.\nIn connection with the Initial Closing of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering, CUR Holdings issued 1,195,033 Preferred Stock Units to the Unit Purchasers, consisting of 1,195,033 Unit Shares and 7,778,119 Unit Warrants, in consideration for (a) gross proceeds of $5,154,361, and (b) the assignment of the Assigned Notes, in the aggregate

of the aggregate net proceeds from the CUR Holdings Offerings (1) to enable the Company to pay outstanding accounts payable, to be negotiated into structured settlements, employee deferred compensation, and monthly payments due by the Company under the New Note, and (2) for working capital and general corporate purposes.

Each Secured Note Conversion Unit consisted of (a) one (1) share of common stock of CUR Holdings (each, a Secured Note Conversion Share\u201d and, collectively, the Secured Note Conversion Shares\u201d), and (b) a 5-year warrant (each, a Secured Note Conversion Warrant\u201d and, collectively, the Secured Note Conversion Warrants\u201d) to purchase one (1) share of common stock of CUR Holdings for every share of common stock of CUR Holdings received upon exchange, at an exercise price per share equal to $1.00.\nIn connection with the Secured Note Assignment Transaction, (a) Holdings issued 1,538,102 Units, consisting of 1,538,102 Secured Note Conversion Shares, and 1,538,102 Secured Note Conversion Warrants, and (b) Holdings became the sole payee under the Secured Notes.\nIn connection with the Secured Note Assignment Transaction, the Initial Placement Agent, received warrants ( Third Placement Agent Warrants\u201d) to purchase (a) 86,377 shares of common stock of CUR Holdings, with a term of five (5) years and an exercise price of $2.00 per share, and (b) 86,377 shares of common stock of CUR Holdings, with a term of five (5) years and an exercise price of $1.00 per share.\nPrior to the Initial Closing of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering, and as a condition thereto, CUR Holdings entered directly into content licensing agreements ( New Music Label Agreements\u201d) with the three major music labels (the Music Labels\u201d). Upon consummation of the Initial Closing of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering, CUR Holdings paid Label Advances due to the Music Labels pursuant to the New Music Label Agreements in the aggregate amount of $2,500,000. In addition, CUR Holdings issued the Music Labels warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,750,000 shares of common stock of CUR Holdings, at an exercise price of $1.00 per share.\nThe Company joined the New Music Label Agreements, while the other two New Music Label Agreements provide C\u00dcR Holdings with the right to sublicense its rights under such agreement to the Company. The New Music Label Agreements provide for a grant to the Company of immediate terminable sublicenses, which will enable the Company to digitally distribute sound recordings and related materials owned or controlled by the those Music Labels in connection with the Company's Internet music service, C\u00dcR Music.\nOn November 16, 2017, the Board of Directors of CUR Holdings increased the number of members constituting the Board of Directors from one (1) to three (3). The Board of Directors of Holdings then appointed Thomas Brophy, the Company's President, Chief Executive Officer, Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, and a member of the Company's Board of Directors, and Edward P. Swyer, a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, as members of the Board of Directors of CUR Holdings, to fill the two vacancies resulting from the increase to the number of seats on the Board of Directors, to serve until their successors shall be duly appointed, unless they resign, are removed from office, or are otherwise disqualified from serving as directors for CUR Holdings.\nImmediately following the Initial Closing of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering, CUR Holdings issued one (1) share of its Series B voting preferred stock ( Series B Preferred Stock\u201d) to William F. Duker, the President and Treasurer of CUR Holdings, and a member of the Board of Directors of CUR Holdings. Pursuant to the Certificate of Designation of Series B Voting Preferred stock of CUR Holdings (the Series B Certificate of Designation\u201d), Mr. Duker, the holder of the Series B Preferred Stock, has the right (a) to elect the number of directors on the Board of Directors of CUR Holdings constituting the majority, and (b) to approve any merger (including the Merger), asset sale (including the Asset Transfer), or other fundamental transaction to be effected by CUR Holdings.\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>60 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs mentioned above, if the Company receives SEC Clearance (or, at the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company and CUR Holdings, as described above), CUR Holdings will consummate the Merger.

The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We continually evaluate our estimates and judgments, our commitments to strategic alliance partners and the timing of the achievement of collaboration milestones. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Besides the estimates identified above that are considered critical, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and judgments are also based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even for estimates and judgments that are not deemed critical.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). Any reference to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative United States generally accepted accounting principles as found in the Accounting Standards Codification and ASUs of the FASB. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, our management evaluates its estimates, which include, but are not limited to, estimates related to accruals, stock-based compensation expense, warrants to purchase securities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. We base our estimates on historical experience and other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates or assumptions.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nResearch and Development Costs\nAll research and development costs, including costs to develop software used in the Company's applications, which do not meet the criteria for capitalization, are expensed when incurred. FASB ASC Topic 730 requires companies involved in research and development activities to capitalize non-refundable advance payments for such services pursuant to contractual arrangements because the right to receive those services represents an economic benefit. Such capitalized advances will be expensed when the services occur and the economic benefit is realized. There were no capitalized research and development services at December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>63 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nStock Compensation\nStock-based payments made to employees, including grants of stock options, are recognized in the statements of operations based on their estimated fair values. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation for awards granted that are expected to vest, on a straight-line basis using the single-option attribution method over the service period of the award, which is generally four years. The Company generally estimates the fair value of employee stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The determination of the fair value of a stock-based award is affected by the deemed fair value of the underlying share price on the grant date, as well as other assumptions including the risk-free interest rate, the estimated volatility of the Company's stock price over the term of the award, the estimated period of time that the Company expects employees to hold their stock options and the expected dividend rate.\nStock-based payments made to non-employees, including grants of stock options, are recognized in the statements of operations based on their estimated fair values. The fair value of these options will be re-measured on each reporting date until the options vest. The re-measured fair value will be recognized as compensation expense over the remaining vesting term of the options.\nDerivative Liabilities\nWe do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposure to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks; however, we have warrants that contain embedded derivatives. We account for stock warrants as either equity instruments or derivative liabilities depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement. Stock warrants that allow for cash settlement or provide for certain modifications of the warrant exercise price are accounted for as derivative liabilities. The Company evaluates embedded conversion features and bifurcates the embedded conversion feature if it is not clearly and closely related to the host agreement. The estimated fair values of the warrant liabilities were determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which takes into account the probabilities of certain events occurring over the life of the warrants. The derivative liabilities are adjusted to their estimated fair values at each reporting period, with any decrease or increase in the estimated fair value being recorded in other income (expense).\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2016, the Company's cash balances may exceed the current insured amounts under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an Accounting Standards Update that simplifies the accounting for certain equity-linked financial instruments and embedded features with down round features that reduce the exercise price when the pricing of a future round of financing is lower. The Secured Notes and Unsecured Notes qualify for derivative treatment due to their embedded conversion feature. The guidance is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.

The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to primarily due to a decrease in compensation costs related to our employee base as we experienced financial difficulties in 2016 and had to decrease our staffing and technical spending. The decrease in stock-based compensation was primarily due to the forfeiture of options resulting from the termination of employees. No expense needed to be recognized on forfeited options. The increase in general and administrative was primarily due to payments to the major Music Labels, an increase in costs related to raising capital for a financing that did not close and an increase in compensation costs related to the hiring of James Urie as Interim Chief Executive Officer.\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>65 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development Expenses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, research and development expenses were $3,983,478 and $7,954,364, respectively. Research and development expenses decreased by $3,970,886, or approximately 49.9%, primarily due to a $2,409,866 decrease in employee compensation costs as we experienced financial difficulties in 2016 and had to decrease our staffing, a $1,401,315 decrease in technical spending, a $1,010,079 decrease in marketing and advertising expenses, offset by a $550,078 increase in content costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, general and administrative expenses were $2,884,124 and $1,951,526 respectively. General and administrative expenses increased by $932,868, or approximately 47.8%, primarily due to an increase of $967,402 in non-cash costs related to warrants issued to content providers, an increase of $546,662 in marketing and advertising costs associated with the media contract, offset by a decrease of $431,080 in professional expenses, including legal fees, accounting fees and investor relations costs. General and administrative expenses include wages expenses, facilities and professional fees.\nStock Based Compensation Expenses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, stock based compensation expenses were $183,950 and $413,714, respectively. Stock based compensation expenses decreased due to fewer shares and options being granted in 2016.\nOther Income (Expense)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, other income (expense) was $709,273 and $1,842,972 respectively. Other income (expense) decreased primarily due to a $2,883,995 increase in interest expense, a $120,266 loss on issuance of convertible debt offset by a $1,411,532 increase in the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities and a $464,686 loss on extinguishment of derivative liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1,508, as compared to $734 at December 31, 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $8,664,956. As of December 31, 2015, we had a working capital deficit of $4,288,488. The decrease of $4,376,468 in working capital was attributable to an increase in accounts payables, an increase in accrued and other current liabilities, an increase in current convertible promissory notes, net, offset by a decrease in derivative liabilities.\nIn January 2014, warrants to purchase 14,315 shares of Common Stock were exercised resulting in gross proceeds of $99,695.\nWe raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $9,680,000 in our 2014 PPO (before deducting placement agent fees and expenses of the 2014 PPO of approximately $1,529,000).\nOn April 6, 2015, we raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $3,234,000 in our Offer to Amend and Exercise (before deducting placement agent fees and expenses of the Offer to Amend and Exercise of approximately $417,000).\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>66 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn October 20, 2015, October 26, 2015, November 13, 2015, November 24, 2015, November 30, 2015, December 30, 2015 and January 14, 2016 we entered into Purchase Agreements with certain Unsecured Buyers, pursuant to which the Unsecured Buyers purchased Unsecured Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,113,500 (before deducting fees and expenses of approximately $45,000).\nOn April 12, 2016, April 15, 2016, May 26, 2016, June 7, 2016 and July 20, 2016, we entered into Purchase Agreements with certain Secured Buyers, pursuant to which the Secured Buyers purchased Secured Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,515,000 (before deducting placement agent fees and expenses of approximately $282,454).\nThe net proceeds from the CUR Holdings Offerings, in the aggregate amount of $6,932,288 (after deducting fees and expenses related to the CUR Holdings Offerings in the aggregate amount of $722,074 (including placement agent fees, legal fees and expenses and fees payable to the escrow agent)) are to be used to pay the required Label Advances to the Music Labels sufficient to allow CUR Holdings and/or the Company to proceed with soliciting subscriptions for C\u00dcR Music, the Company's Internet music service, and to extend a line of credit to the Company (the Post-Closing Line of Credit Note\u201d), for up to the full amount of the aggregate net proceeds from the CUR Holdings Offerings (1) to enable the Company to pay outstanding accounts payable, to be negotiated into structured settlements, employee deferred compensation, and monthly payments due by the Company under the New Note, and (2) for working capital and general corporate purposes. The process for requesting and approving drawdowns on the Post-Closing Line of Credit Note is to be determined, and will be reflected in the definitive documentation for the transaction.\nOur original agreements with UMG and SME have been terminated and we are in default of our original agreement with WMG. Simultaneously with the closings of the CUR Holdings Offerings, CUR Holdings and the Company entered into the New Music Label Agreements with UMG, SME and WMG. We also plan to enter into content licensing agreements with certain independent music labels, music publishers and performance rights organizations. The cost of entering into our previous content licensing agreements with major music labels, performance rights organizations and publishers including legal and consulting fees was approximately $9,000,000, the majority of which was initial prepayments to content providers. The Company was unable to raise the capital to enable it to pay the prepayments to content providers. As soon as the Post-Closing Line of Credit is in place with CUR Holdings,, we intend to have a dedicated team of software engineers, led by our Chief Technology Officer and Chief Operating Officer, working on enhancing the technology platform, as well as the iOS and Android applications and the C\u00dcR Music website.\nNot including non-cash expenses, we have spent approximately $21.6 million on research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs to complete the development of the C\u00dcR Music, for the time period since the Contribution in January 2014 through the date of this filing. Of the total $21.6 million, a total of approximately $15.9 million is related to research and development and approximately $5.7 million is related to general and administrative costs.\nIn order to bring C\u00dcR Music to market, we need to raise a substantial amount of capital, to implement our business plan, market C\u00dcR Music, for content license costs, and for general working capital. We expect that the net proceeds from the CUR Holdings Offerings will be available to us and represented by the Post-Closing Line of Credit Note. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when required in sufficient amounts, on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unsuccessful at raising sufficient funds, for whatever reason, to fund our operations, we may be forced to seek a buyer for our business or seek a similar transaction. If all of these alternatives fail, we expect that we will be required to seek protection from creditors under applicable bankruptcy laws.\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>67 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $2,649,393 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to net cash used of $7,976,945 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease of $5,327,552, or 66.8%, in net cash used in operations was primarily due to an increase in non-cash interest expense of $2,464,833, a decrease in net loss of $2,135,845, an increase in accounts payable of $1,831,581, an increase in accrued liabilities and other current liabilities of $1,770,194, an increase in non-cash label warrant expense of $967,402, offset by a $3,781,492 change in the fair value of derivative liabilities\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we used $0 and $19,706, respectively, of cash in investing activities. The cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 was for the purchase of computers and related hardware, software, other office equipment such as phones and tablets associated with additional staff and development and testing as well as the cost to register our trademark for C\u00dcR. The current year decrease was due to the company not spending any funds on equipment.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we received $2,656,000 and $1,972,500, respectively, in proceeds from the sale of Secured and Unsecured Notes. In addition, in 2015 we received $2,819,366 in proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock and warrants related to the Offer to Amend and Exercise Warrants.\nGoing Concern\nOur independent auditor has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and believes that our ability is dependent on our ability to implement our business plan, raise capital and generate revenues.

The financial information contained herein has been retroactivity adjusted for a reverse stock split at the rate of 1-for-13, which we effected on February 16, 2016. The following discussion and analysis are based on our audited financial statements contained in this Annual Report, which we have prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. You should read the discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto.\nAs a result of the Contribution and the related change in our business and operations, a discussion of our past financial results is not pertinent, and under applicable accounting principles the historical financial results of C\u00dcR Media, LLC (formerly Raditaz, LLC), the accounting acquirer, prior to the Contribution are considered the historical financial results of the Company.\nThe audited financial statements included in this Annual Report include a summary of our significant accounting policies, and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations for such periods have been included in these audited financial statements. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.\nGeneral Overview\nWe were incorporated in the State of Delaware as Duane Street Corp. on November 17, 2011. Our original business was manufacturing and marketing baby products. Prior to the Contribution (as defined below), our Board of Directors determined to discontinue operations in this area and to seek a new business opportunity.\nOn January 28, 2014, we consummated the Contribution with C\u00dcR Media, LLC, a limited liability company organized in the State of Connecticut on February 15, 2008, pursuant to a Contribution Agreement by and among the Company, C\u00dcR Media, LLC, and the holders of a majority of C\u00dcR Media, LLC's limited liability company membership interests (the \"Contribution Agreement\"). In connection with the Contribution, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Contribution Agreement, all outstanding securities of C\u00dcR Media, LLC were exchanged for securities of ours.\n\nC\u00dcR Media, LLC's activities since inception were devoted primarily to the development and commercialization of Raditaz, a DMCA compliant internet radio product. Raditaz was launched in early 2012 and the platform was continually developed and improved through November 2013 when its iOS, Android and web products were removed from the market, to allow us to focus on the further development of our C\u00dcR Music product.\nThe Raditaz music streaming platform and products were under development since 2010 and, prior to the 2014 PPO (as defined below) were financed primarily from angel investments in the aggregate amount of approximately $4,858,000, $150,000 of financing from a promissory note from CT Innovations, Incorporated, and a $100,000 promissory note and a $100,000 grant from the State of Connecticut Department of Economic Development.\nAs a result of the Contribution, C\u00dcR Media, LLC became our wholly owned subsidiary, and we adopted the business of C\u00dcR Media, LLC, which is to develop and commercialize a streaming music experience for listening on the web and mobile devices, as our sole line of business.\nOn January 31, 2014, we changed our name to C\u00dcR Media, Inc., a name that more accurately represents our new business focus. In connection with the name change, we changed our OTC trading symbol to \"CURM.\"\nIn addition, on January 31, 2014, we increased our number of authorized shares to 310,000,000 shares, consisting of (i) 300,000,000 shares of Common Stock, and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share.\nFurther, on January 31, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a 1.26953123-for-1 forward split of our Common Stock, in the form of a dividend, pursuant to which each shareholder of our Common Stock as of the record date received 1.19260815 additional shares of Common Stock for each one share owned.\nIn a private placement financing we conducted with respect to which closings occurred on January 28, 2014, March 14, 2014 and March 28, 2014 (the \"2014 PPO\"), we sold an aggregate of 744,756 shares of our Common Stock, and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 744,756 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $26.00 per share for a term of five (5) years (\"PPO Warrants\"), for gross proceeds of approximately $9,680,000 (before deducting placement agent fees and expenses of the 2014 PPO estimated at approximately $1,529,000).\nThe placement agent for the 2014 PPO and its sub-agent were paid an aggregate commission of approximately $968,000 and were issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 74,483 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $13.00 per share for a term of five (5) years (\"Broker Warrants\").\nOn April 6, 2015, we consummated an offer to amend and exercise the PPO Warrants (the \"Offer to Amend and Exercise Warrants\"). The PPO Warrants of holders who elected to participate in the Offer to Amend and Exercise Warrants were amended to, among other things, remove the price-based anti-dilution provisions contained therein and reduce the exercise price from $26.00 to $6.50 per share of Common Stock. Pursuant to the Offer to Amend and Exercise Warrants, an aggregate of 497,548 PPO Warrants were amended and exercised by their holders, for gross proceeds of approximately $3,234,000 (before deducting warrant agent fees and expenses of the Offer to Amend and Exercise estimated at approximately $417,000).\nEffective on or prior to April 6, 2015, the Company and the holders of (a) 113,469 PPO Warrants, that chose not to participate in the Offer to Amend and Exercise Warrants (\"Non-Participating Original Warrants\"), and (b) all 74,483 Broker Warrants, approved an amendment to remove the price-based anti-dilution provisions in their warrants. As a result, the price-based anti-dilution provisions contained in these Non-Participating Original Warrants and Broker Warrants have been removed and are of no further force or effect as of April 6, 2015.\nThe warrant agent for the Offer to Amend and Exercise Warrants was paid an aggregate commission of approximately $323,350 and was issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 49,752 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $6.50 per share for a term of five (5) years (\"Warrant Agent Warrants\").\n\nCertain securities we issued in the 2014 PPO had price-based anti-dilution protection, if, within twenty-four (24) months after the final closing of the 2014 PPO, we issued additional shares of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents (subject to customary exceptions) for a consideration per share less than $13.00. Of the 744,756 PPO Warrants, 133,739 still had these priced-based anti-dilution rights through March 28, 2016. With the consummation of the exercise and amendment of the PPO Warrants and the issuance of the Warrant Agent Warrants to the Warrant Agent, the anti-dilution provisions were triggered and the non-participating warrant holders received: (i) an aggregate of 17,180 additional shares of Common Stock (ii) a reduction in the price of their PPO Warrants from $26.00 per share to $23.01 per share, and (iii) an aggregate of 17,180 additional warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company at an exercise price of $23.01 per share.\nOn October 20, 2015, October 26, 2015, November 13, 2015, November 24, 2015, November 30, 2015, December 30, 2015 and January 14, 2016 we entered into Securities Purchase Agreements (in this case, the \"Purchase Agreements\") with certain \"accredited investors (the \"Unsecured Buyers\"), pursuant to which the Unsecured Buyers purchased 12% Unsecured Convertible Promissory Notes of the Company (the \"Unsecured Notes\") in the aggregate principal amount of $2,113,500 (the \"First Convertible Note Offering\"). The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company were $2,113,500 (before deducting expenses related to the purchase and sale of the Unsecured Notes of approximately $45,000), of which $586,000 in proceeds were from members of the Board of Directors.\nWith the issuance of Unsecured Notes, the Anti-Dilution Rights were triggered and the holders of the Non-Participating Original Warrants received, or are entitled to receive: (i) an aggregate of 18,674 additional shares of Common Stock, (ii) a reduction in the price of their PPO Warrants from $23.01 per share to $20.50 per share, and (iii) an aggregate of 18,674 additional warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company at an exercise price of $20.50 per share.\nOn February 16, 2016, we effected a 1-for-13 reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split\u201d). Upon effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split, every thirteen (13) outstanding shares of our Common Stock (\"Old Common Stock\") were, without any further action by us, or any holder thereof, combined into and automatically became one (1) share of our Common Stock. Any fractional shares have been rounded up to one whole common share. All shares of Common Stock eliminated as a result of the Reverse Stock Split have been cancelled such that they were returned to our authorized and unissued capital stock, and our capital has been reduced by an amount equal to the par value of the Old Common Stock so retired.\nOn April 12, 2016, April 15, 2016, May 26, 2016, June 7, 2016 and July 20, 2016 the Company entered into Securities Purchase Agreements (in this case, the \"Purchase Agreements\") with certain \"accredited investors\" (the \"Secured Buyers\"), pursuant to which the Secured Buyers purchased 12% Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes of the Company (the \"Secured Notes\") in the aggregate principal amount of $2,515,000 (before deducting placement agent fees and expenses of $282,454) (the \"Second Convertible Note Offering\").\nThe Company used the net proceeds from the Second Convertible Note Offering for certain payments to content owners, and working capital and general corporate purposes.\nThe Secured Notes are secured by a security interest in and lien on all now owned or hereafter acquired assets and property, real and personal, of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Company's intellectual and technology property pursuant to the terms of a security agreement (in this case, the \"Security Agreement\") among the Company and the Secured Buyers. The security interest in and liens on all assets and property of the Company will be a first priority security interest.\n\nThe Secured Notes have an aggregate principal balance of $2,515,000, and a stated maturity date of 6 months from the date of issuance. The principal on the Secured Notes bears interest at a rate of 12% per annum, which is also payable on maturity. The Secured Notes will rank senior to all existing indebtedness of the Company, except as otherwise set forth in the Secured Notes. Upon the closing of a financing (in this case, a \"Qualified Offering\") by the Company during the term of the Secured Notes involving the sale of at least $15,000,000 in Equity Financing Securities, all of the outstanding principal amount of the Secured Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest due thereon, will automatically convert (in this case, a \"Mandatory Conversion\") into units of the Company's securities (the \"Second Units\") at a conversion price per Second Unit equal to the lesser of (a) 80% of the price per share of the Equity Financing Securities sold in the Qualified Offering, or (b) $2.00. At any time prior to a Mandatory Conversion, the holders of the Secured Notes may convert all or part of the outstanding principal amount of the Secured Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest due thereon, into Second Units at a conversion price of $2.00 per Unit (in this case, an \"Optional Conversion\"). Each Second Unit will consists of one share (the \"Second Unit Shares\") of the Company's Common Stock, and one five-year warrant (the \"Second Unit Warrants\") to purchase one additional share (the \"Second Unit Warrant Shares\") of the Company's Common Stock at an exercise price equal to (a) 125% of the price at which the Company's equity securities (or securities convertible into or exercisable for equity securities) are sold in a Qualified Offering in the event of a Mandatory Conversion, or (b) 125% of $2.00 in the event of an Optional Conversion. Upon failure by the Company to pay any principal amount or interest due under the Secured Notes within 5 days of the date such payment is due, or the occurrence of other event of default under the terms of the Secured Notes, the entire unpaid principal balance of the Secured Notes, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, will become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each holder of a Secured Note will be entitled to receive, pari passu with the other holders of the Secured Notes, and in preference to the holders of the Company's other outstanding securities, an amount equal to two times the principal amount of, and any accrued and unpaid interest on, such holder's Secured Note. The conversion price and number of Second Units issuable upon conversion of the Secured Notes will be subject to adjustment from time to time for subdivision or consolidation of shares and other standard dilutive events.\nPursuant to the terms of a Placement Agency Agreement (in this case, the \"Placement Agency Agreement\") between the Company and the placement agent for the Second Convertible Note Offering (in this case, the \"Placement Agent\"), in connection with the closing of the Second Convertible Note Offering, the Placement Agent was paid a commission of an aggregate of $236,500. In addition, the Placement Agent, or its designees, received warrants to purchase a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 10% of the number of Second Unit Shares into which Secured Notes sold in the Second Convertible Note Offering to Secured Buyers introduced to the Second Convertible Note Offering by the Placement Agent, and 8% of the number of Second Unit Shares into which Secured Notes sold in the Second Convertible Note Offering to Secured Buyers introduced to the Second Convertible Note Offering by the Company or its representatives, are converted upon a Mandatory Conversion, with a term of 5 years and an exercise price per share equal to the exercise price of the Second Unit Warrant Shares issued to Secured Buyers introduced to the Second Convertible Note Offering by the Placement Agent upon a Mandatory Conversion (\"Placement Agent Warrants\").\nThe Second Unit Warrants, to be received upon conversion of the Secured Notes, provide for the purchase of shares of the Company's Common Stock an exercise price equal to (a) 125% of the price at which the Company's Equity Financing Securities are sold in a Qualified Offering in the event of a Mandatory Conversion, or (b) 125% of $2.00 in the event of an Optional Conversion. The Second Unit Warrants are exercisable for cash only, for a term of five (5) years from the date of issuance. The number of shares of Common Stock to be deliverable upon exercise of the Second Unit Warrants is subject to adjustment for subdivision or consolidation of shares and other standard dilutive events.\nThe Company granted registration rights to each Secured Buyer with respect to the Second Unit Shares and Second Unit Warrant Shares, and to the Placement Agent, with respect to the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Placement Agent Warrants, in each case on a pari passu basis with, and upon substantially the same terms as the registration rights granted to, the investors in a Qualified Offering.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had devoted substantially all of our efforts to product development, raising capital and building our technology infrastructure. As of that date, we did not receive any revenues from our planned principal operations.\n\nOur Strategy\nOur C\u00dcR Music product is a new streaming music experience that combines the listening experience of free internet radio products with an on-demand listening experience for listening on web and mobile devices, beginning at $1.99 per month. C\u00dcR Music will target consumers who are seeking a more comprehensive music streaming service than current free, ad-supported music streaming products. We believe that the C\u00dcR Music product will include a hybrid model that includes many features that free, ad-supported internet radio products provide, without interruptive advertising, with a limited on-demand offering, and will include a social toolset that enables consumers to curate certain aspects their playlists.\nIn addition to revenue from subscriptions, our business plan includes a second revenue stream of personalized advertising, which will not interrupt a stream, but will target a user's listening habits. The advertising may be in the form of, display ads, email and text messages. Our business plan further includes a third revenue stream from the sale of music, concert tickets and merchandise through our music streaming service, to be tailored to each listeners taste based on prior listening trends. We plan to sell advertising, music downloads and concert tickets and merchandise in the future subsequent to launch.\nIn addition, our business plan includes distributing our music streaming service through Apple's iTunes App Store to iOS devices, Google's Google Play Store to Android devices and the internet, among other distribution channels and platforms. At launch, we plan to have an iOS application, Android application and a C\u00dcR Music website.\nWe plan to source our music from MusicNet, Inc. d/b/a Media Net Digital, Inc. We also plan to use Amazon web services to support certain of the technological needs of the business.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we continued to pursue sources of equity and/or debt financing to support our operations. We were not successful in raising the necessary funds as of December 31, 2016. We cannot launch our music streaming product and platform until we have raised the necessary funds.\nRecent Developments\nDefaults under Agreements with Content Providers\nAs previously reported, the Company had entered into Music Label Agreements with certain Music Labels, pursuant to which the Company was provided limited, non-exclusive licenses to digitally distribute certain sound recordings and related materials owned or controlled by the Music Labels in connection with the Company's C\u00dcR-branded Internet music service, C\u00dcR Music, to be composed of three progressively priced and increasingly functional tiers, within the United States and its territories, commonwealths, and possessions. The Company had also entered into Publishing Agreements with certain Music Publishers either directly or through a third party, pursuant to which the Company had been provided the non-exclusive right and license to use certain musical works owned, controlled and/or administered by the Music Publishers in connection with C\u00dcR Music, within the United States and its territories, commonwealths, and possessions. The Music Label Agreements and Publishing Agreements may be collectively referred to herein as the \"Content Agreements,\" and the Music Labels and Music Publishers may be collectively referred to herein as the \"Content Providers.\u201d\n\nPursuant to the Content Agreements, the Company was required to pay certain minimum content fees over the term of the Content Agreements as follows: $14,000,000 in the first year of the agreements, of which approximately $8,000,000 was due on January 31, 2016, $25,500,000 in the second year of the agreements, and $18,500,000 in the third year of the agreements. The Content Providers previously agreed to provide the Company additional time to make the $8,000,000 in payments through both oral and written agreements. Under those agreements, the Company had until June 15, 2016 to make such payments. The Company paid an aggregate of $500,000 of the proceeds from the closing of the Secured Notes to the Content Providers.\nOn September 20, 2016, our Music Label Agreements with SME and UMG were terminated as a result of our failure to pay SME and UMG the advances due pursuant to such agreements. The Company also defaulted on its Music Label Agreement with WMG as a result of its failure to pay WMG the advance due pursuant to such agreement.\nThe Company issued the Content Providers warrants (\"Content Provider Warrants\") to purchase an aggregate of 215,279 shares (the \"Content Provider Warrant Shares\") of the Company's Common Stock at a weighted average exercise price of $6.41 per share. The Content Provider Warrants have a weighted average contractual term of 6.45 years. The exercise price and number of Content Provider Warrant Shares are subject to adjustment for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or other similar event.\nDefault on Secured Notes\nOn October 12, 2016, October 15, 2016, November 26, 2016, December 7, 2016, December 20, 2016 and January 20, 2017, the principal and any accrued and unpaid interest on our outstanding Secured Notes in the principal amount of an aggregate of $2,515,000 became due and payable. We were unable to repay the noteholders at that time. Pursuant to the terms of the Secured Notes, our failure to pay any principal or interest within five (5) days of the date such payment was due constituted an event of default. Following the occurrence of an event of default, among other things, the interest rate on the Secured Notes increased to 15%. In addition to other remedies available to the noteholders, our obligation to repay amounts due under the Secured Notes is secured by a first priority security interest in and lien on all of our assets and property, including our intellectual property.\nSimultaneously with the Initial Closing (as defined below) of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering (as defined below), the holder of the Secured Note (the Secured Noteholders\u201d) assigned, conveyed, transferred and set over to CUR Holdings all of the Secured Noteholders' right, title, interest and obligations in, to and under the Secured Notes, and all claims, suits, causes of action and any other rights thereunder, to CUR Holdings. As a result, CUR Holdings became the sole payee under the Secured Notes.\nReceipt of Wells Notice\nOn July 19, 2017, we received a Wells Notice\u201d from the staff (the Staff\u201d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d). The Wells Notice provides notification to the Company that the Staff has made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC institute administrative proceedings against the Company pursuant to Sections 12(j) and 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d), based solely upon the Company's failure to comply with its reporting obligations under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act. Sections 12(j) grants the SEC the right, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, to revoke the registration of a security. Section 12(k) grants the SEC the right to suspend trading in a security.\n\nIn accordance with SEC rules, on August 25, 2017, the Company made a written submission to the SEC in response to the Wells Notice, in which, among other things, it conveyed the Company's present intention to file the delinquent reports and become current with its SEC filing requirements and, as such, set forth the reasons why the proposed enforcement action should not be filed. While no assurances can be made, the Company believes that, as a result of making these filings, the SEC will have no further reason to institute the proposed administrative proceedings, or, if instituted, to continue such proceedings. However, there can be no assurance that the SEC will not bring an enforcement action against the Company, which could result in a trading suspension of the Company's Common Stock and the de-registration of the Company's securities under the Exchange Act. Administrative proceedings, if instituted, will be held before an administrative law judge.\nAt the time we received the Wells Notice, the Company had not filed its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC for the quarters ended June 30, 2016, September 30, 2016, March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017. The Company also had not filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of this filing, the remaining delinquent reports consist of the Company's Form 10-Qs for the quarters ended March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017.\nDefaults on Vendor Agreements\nAs of September 27, 2016, our Data License and Services Agreement (the \"Rovi Agreement\") with Rovi Data Solutions, Inc. and Veveo, Inc. (collectively, Rovi\u201d) terminated as a result of our failure to pay Rovi past due balances for the services they provided under the Rovi Agreement.\nWe are in default under our Distribution Agreement (the \"MediaNet Agreement\") with MusicNet, Inc., d/b/a MediaNet Digital, Inc. (\"MediaNet\") as a result of our failure to pay MediaNet past due balances for the services they provided under the MediaNet Agreement.

The Company intends to cure the default once it is adequately funded.\nOn October 12, 2016, we received a notice of default from Zuora, Inc. (\"Zuora\") confirming that the Company is in default under its Master Subscription Agreement with Zuora (the \"Zuora Agreement\") as a result of our failure to pay Zuora past due balances for the services they provided under the Zuora Agreement. The Company intends to cure the default once it is adequately funded.\nWe are in default under our Sponsorship Agreement (the \"Live Nation Agreement\") with Live Nation Marketing, Inc. (\"Live Nation\") as a result of the Company's failure to pay Live Nation past due balances for the services they provided under the Live Nation Agreement. To date, we have not received a notice of default from Live Nation. The Company intends to cure the default once it is adequately funded.\nAs of this date, we are in default of all of our vendor agreements as a result of not making the required payments.\nSix-Month Line of Credit Promissory Note\nOn July 6, 2017, we entered into a Six-Month Line of Credit Promissory Note (the Line of Credit Note\u201d) with CUR Holdings, LLC, a New York limited liability company. The Line of Credit Note has a principal balance of $685,000, and a stated maturity date of December 6, 2017. The principal on the Line of Credit Note does not bear interest. The Line of Credit Note is not convertible. The Line of Credit Note ranks junior to the Company's existing Secured Notes.\nIn connection with the Initial Closing of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering (as defined below), the Line of Credit Note was assigned and transferred to CUR Holdings (as defined below). As a result, CUR Holdings became the payee under the Line of Credit Note.\n\nSettlement Agreement and Mutual Release\nAs previously reported, the Company defaulted under its Master Multiple Services Agreement (the Digitas Agreement\u201d) with Digitas, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation ( Digitas\u201d), as a result of the Company's failure to pay Digitas past due balances for the services Digitas provided under the Digitas Agreement. Digitas filed a claim against the Company for damages in the aggregate amount of $650,000 (the Claimed Amount\u201d), together with pre-judgment interest, post-judgment interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. On November 15, 2017, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (the Settlement Agreement\u201d) with Digitas, pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay Digitas an aggregate of $400,000, in full settlement of any and all claims arising from or relating to amounts due under the Master Multiple Services Agreement (the Claims\u201d). Digitas agreed to release the Company from any further Claims, subject only to the Company meeting its payment obligations under the Settlement Agreement and the Digitas Note (as defined below).\nSimultaneously with the execution of the Settlement Agreement, the Company issued a Promissory Note to Digitas (the Digitas Note\u201d) in the principal amount of $400,000.

The financial information contained herein has been retroactivity adjusted for a reverse stock split at the rate of 1-for-13, which we effected on February 16, 2016. The following discussion and analysis are based on our audited financial statements contained in this Annual Report, which we have prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. You should read the discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto.\nAs a result of the Contribution and the related change in our business and operations, a discussion of our past financial results is not pertinent, and under applicable accounting principles the historical financial results of C\u00dcR Media, LLC (formerly Raditaz, LLC), the accounting acquirer, prior to the Contribution are considered the historical financial results of the Company.\nThe audited financial statements included in this Annual Report include a summary of our significant accounting policies, and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations for such periods have been included in these audited financial statements. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.\nGeneral Overview\nWe were incorporated in the State of Delaware as Duane Street Corp. on November 17, 2011. Our original business was manufacturing and marketing baby products. Prior to the Contribution (as defined below), our Board of Directors determined to discontinue operations in this area and to seek a new business opportunity.\nOn January 28, 2014, we consummated the Contribution with C\u00dcR Media, LLC, a limited liability company organized in the State of Connecticut on February 15, 2008, pursuant to a Contribution Agreement by and among the Company, C\u00dcR Media, LLC, and the holders of a majority of C\u00dcR Media, LLC's limited liability company membership interests (the \"Contribution Agreement\"). In connection with the Contribution, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Contribution Agreement, all outstanding securities of C\u00dcR Media, LLC were exchanged for securities of ours.\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>51 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nC\u00dcR Media, LLC's activities since inception were devoted primarily to the development and commercialization of Raditaz, a DMCA compliant internet radio product. Raditaz was launched in early 2012 and the platform was continually developed and improved through November 2013 when its iOS, Android and web products were removed from the market, to allow us to focus on the further development of our C\u00dcR Music product.\nThe Raditaz music streaming platform and products were under development since 2010 and, prior to the 2014 PPO (as defined below) were financed primarily from angel investments in the aggregate amount of approximately $4,858,000, $150,000 of financing from a promissory note from CT Innovations, Incorporated, and a $100,000 promissory note and a $100,000 grant from the State of Connecticut Department of Economic Development.\nAs a result of the Contribution, C\u00dcR Media, LLC became our wholly owned subsidiary, and we adopted the business of C\u00dcR Media, LLC, which is to develop and commercialize a streaming music experience for listening on the web and mobile devices, as our sole line of business.\nOn January 31, 2014, we changed our name to C\u00dcR Media, Inc., a name that more accurately represents our new business focus. In connection with the name change, we changed our OTC trading symbol to \"CURM.\"\nIn addition, on January 31, 2014, we increased our number of authorized shares to 310,000,000 shares, consisting of (i) 300,000,000 shares of Common Stock, and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share.\nFurther, on January 31, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a 1.26953123-for-1 forward split of our Common Stock, in the form of a dividend, pursuant to which each shareholder of our Common Stock as of the record date received 1.19260815 additional shares of Common Stock for each one share owned.\nIn a private placement financing we conducted with respect to which closings occurred on January 28, 2014, March 14, 2014 and March 28, 2014 (the \"2014 PPO\"), we sold an aggregate of 744,756 shares of our Common Stock, and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 744,756 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $26.00 per share for a term of five (5) years (\"PPO Warrants\"), for gross proceeds of approximately $9,680,000 (before deducting placement agent fees and expenses of the 2014 PPO estimated at approximately $1,529,000).\nThe placement agent for the 2014 PPO and its sub-agent were paid an aggregate commission of approximately $968,000 and were issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 74,483 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $13.00 per share for a term of five (5) years (\"Broker Warrants\").\nOn April 6, 2015, we consummated an offer to amend and exercise the PPO Warrants (the \"Offer to Amend and Exercise Warrants\"). The PPO Warrants of holders who elected to participate in the Offer to Amend and Exercise Warrants were amended to, among other things, remove the price-based anti-dilution provisions contained therein and reduce the exercise price from $26.00 to $6.50 per share of Common Stock. Pursuant to the Offer to Amend and Exercise Warrants, an aggregate of 497,548 PPO Warrants were amended and exercised by their holders, for gross proceeds of approximately $3,234,000 (before deducting warrant agent fees and expenses of the Offer to Amend and Exercise estimated at approximately $417,000).\nEffective on or prior to April 6, 2015, the Company and the holders of (a) 113,469 PPO Warrants, that chose not to participate in the Offer to Amend and Exercise Warrants (\"Non-Participating Original Warrants\"), and (b) all 74,483 Broker Warrants, approved an amendment to remove the price-based anti-dilution provisions in their warrants. As a result, the price-based anti-dilution provisions contained in these Non-Participating Original Warrants and Broker Warrants have been removed and are of no further force or effect as of April 6, 2015.\nThe warrant agent for the Offer to Amend and Exercise Warrants was paid an aggregate commission of approximately $323,350 and was issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 49,752 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $6.50 per share for a term of five (5) years (\"Warrant Agent Warrants\").\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>52 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertain securities we issued in the 2014 PPO had price-based anti-dilution protection, if, within twenty-four (24) months after the final closing of the 2014 PPO, we issued additional shares of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents (subject to customary exceptions) for a consideration per share less than $13.00. Of the 744,756 PPO Warrants, 133,739 still had these priced-based anti-dilution rights through March 28, 2016. With the consummation of the exercise and amendment of the PPO Warrants and the issuance of the Warrant Agent Warrants to the Warrant Agent, the anti-dilution provisions were triggered and the non-participating warrant holders received: (i) an aggregate of 17,180 additional shares of Common Stock (ii) a reduction in the price of their PPO Warrants from $26.00 per share to $23.01 per share, and (iii) an aggregate of 17,180 additional warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company at an exercise price of $23.01 per share.\nOn October 20, 2015, October 26, 2015, November 13, 2015, November 24, 2015, November 30, 2015, December 30, 2015 and January 14, 2016 we entered into Securities Purchase Agreements (in this case, the \"Purchase Agreements\") with certain \"accredited investors (the \"Unsecured Buyers\"), pursuant to which the Unsecured Buyers purchased 12% Unsecured Convertible Promissory Notes of the Company (the \"Unsecured Notes\") in the aggregate principal amount of $2,113,500 (the \"First Convertible Note Offering\"). The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company were $2,113,500 (before deducting expenses related to the purchase and sale of the Unsecured Notes of approximately $45,000), of which $586,000 in proceeds were from members of the Board of Directors.\nWith the issuance of Unsecured Notes, the Anti-Dilution Rights were triggered and the holders of the Non-Participating Original Warrants received, or are entitled to receive: (i) an aggregate of 18,674 additional shares of Common Stock, (ii) a reduction in the price of their PPO Warrants from $23.01 per share to $20.50 per share, and (iii) an aggregate of 18,674 additional warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company at an exercise price of $20.50 per share.\nOn February 16, 2016, we effected a 1-for-13 reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split\u201d). Upon effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split, every thirteen (13) outstanding shares of our Common Stock (\"Old Common Stock\") were, without any further action by us, or any holder thereof, combined into and automatically became one (1) share of our Common Stock. Any fractional shares have been rounded up to one whole common share. All shares of Common Stock eliminated as a result of the Reverse Stock Split have been cancelled such that they were returned to our authorized and unissued capital stock, and our capital has been reduced by an amount equal to the par value of the Old Common Stock so retired.\nOn April 12, 2016, April 15, 2016, May 26, 2016, June 7, 2016 and July 20, 2016 the Company entered into Securities Purchase Agreements (in this case, the \"Purchase Agreements\") with certain \"accredited investors\" (the \"Secured Buyers\"), pursuant to which the Secured Buyers purchased 12% Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes of the Company (the \"Secured Notes\") in the aggregate principal amount of $2,515,000 (before deducting placement agent fees and expenses of $282,454) (the \"Second Convertible Note Offering\").\nThe Company used the net proceeds from the Second Convertible Note Offering for certain payments to content owners, and working capital and general corporate purposes.\nThe Secured Notes are secured by a security interest in and lien on all now owned or hereafter acquired assets and property, real and personal, of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Company's intellectual and technology property pursuant to the terms of a security agreement (in this case, the \"Security Agreement\") among the Company and the Secured Buyers. The security interest in and liens on all assets and property of the Company will be a first priority security interest.\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>53 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Secured Notes have an aggregate principal balance of $2,515,000, and a stated maturity date of 6 months from the date of issuance. The principal on the Secured Notes bears interest at a rate of 12% per annum, which is also payable on maturity. The Secured Notes will rank senior to all existing indebtedness of the Company, except as otherwise set forth in the Secured Notes. Upon the closing of a financing (in this case, a \"Qualified Offering\") by the Company during the term of the Secured Notes involving the sale of at least $15,000,000 in Equity Financing Securities, all of the outstanding principal amount of the Secured Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest due thereon, will automatically convert (in this case, a \"Mandatory Conversion\") into units of the Company's securities (the \"Second Units\") at a conversion price per Second Unit equal to the lesser of (a) 80% of the price per share of the Equity Financing Securities sold in the Qualified Offering, or (b) $2.00. At any time prior to a Mandatory Conversion, the holders of the Secured Notes may convert all or part of the outstanding principal amount of the Secured Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest due thereon, into Second Units at a conversion price of $2.00 per Unit (in this case, an \"Optional Conversion\"). Each Second Unit will consists of one share (the \"Second Unit Shares\") of the Company's Common Stock, and one five-year warrant (the \"Second Unit Warrants\") to purchase one additional share (the \"Second Unit Warrant Shares\") of the Company's Common Stock at an exercise price equal to (a) 125% of the price at which the Company's equity securities (or securities convertible into or exercisable for equity securities) are sold in a Qualified Offering in the event of a Mandatory Conversion, or (b) 125% of $2.00 in the event of an Optional Conversion. Upon failure by the Company to pay any principal amount or interest due under the Secured Notes within 5 days of the date such payment is due, or the occurrence of other event of default under the terms of the Secured Notes, the entire unpaid principal balance of the Secured Notes, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, will become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each holder of a Secured Note will be entitled to receive, pari passu with the other holders of the Secured Notes, and in preference to the holders of the Company's other outstanding securities, an amount equal to two times the principal amount of, and any accrued and unpaid interest on, such holder's Secured Note. The conversion price and number of Second Units issuable upon conversion of the Secured Notes will be subject to adjustment from time to time for subdivision or consolidation of shares and other standard dilutive events.\nPursuant to the terms of a Placement Agency Agreement (in this case, the \"Placement Agency Agreement\") between the Company and the placement agent for the Second Convertible Note Offering (in this case, the \"Placement Agent\"), in connection with the closing of the Second Convertible Note Offering, the Placement Agent was paid a commission of an aggregate of $236,500. In addition, the Placement Agent, or its designees, received warrants to purchase a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 10% of the number of Second Unit Shares into which Secured Notes sold in the Second Convertible Note Offering to Secured Buyers introduced to the Second Convertible Note Offering by the Placement Agent, and 8% of the number of Second Unit Shares into which Secured Notes sold in the Second Convertible Note Offering to Secured Buyers introduced to the Second Convertible Note Offering by the Company or its representatives, are converted upon a Mandatory Conversion, with a term of 5 years and an exercise price per share equal to the exercise price of the Second Unit Warrant Shares issued to Secured Buyers introduced to the Second Convertible Note Offering by the Placement Agent upon a Mandatory Conversion (\"Placement Agent Warrants\").\nThe Second Unit Warrants, to be received upon conversion of the Secured Notes, provide for the purchase of shares of the Company's Common Stock an exercise price equal to (a) 125% of the price at which the Company's Equity Financing Securities are sold in a Qualified Offering in the event of a Mandatory Conversion, or (b) 125% of $2.00 in the event of an Optional Conversion. The Second Unit Warrants are exercisable for cash only, for a term of five (5) years from the date of issuance. The number of shares of Common Stock to be deliverable upon exercise of the Second Unit Warrants is subject to adjustment for subdivision or consolidation of shares and other standard dilutive events.\nThe Company granted registration rights to each Secured Buyer with respect to the Second Unit Shares and Second Unit Warrant Shares, and to the Placement Agent, with respect to the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Placement Agent Warrants, in each case on a pari passu basis with, and upon substantially the same terms as the registration rights granted to, the investors in a Qualified Offering.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had devoted substantially all of our efforts to product development, raising capital and building our technology infrastructure. As of that date, we did not receive any revenues from our planned principal operations.\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>54 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Strategy\nOur C\u00dcR Music product is a new streaming music experience that combines the listening experience of free internet radio products with an on-demand listening experience for listening on web and mobile devices, beginning at $1.99 per month. C\u00dcR Music will target consumers who are seeking a more comprehensive music streaming service than current free, ad-supported music streaming products. We believe that the C\u00dcR Music product will include a hybrid model that includes many features that free, ad-supported internet radio products provide, without interruptive advertising, with a limited on-demand offering, and will include a social toolset that enables consumers to curate certain aspects their playlists.\nIn addition to revenue from subscriptions, our business plan includes a second revenue stream of personalized advertising, which will not interrupt a stream, but will target a user's listening habits. The advertising may be in the form of, display ads, email and text messages. Our business plan further includes a third revenue stream from the sale of music, concert tickets and merchandise through our music streaming service, to be tailored to each listeners taste based on prior listening trends. We plan to sell advertising, music downloads and concert tickets and merchandise in the future subsequent to launch.\nIn addition, our business plan includes distributing our music streaming service through Apple's iTunes App Store to iOS devices, Google's Google Play Store to Android devices and the internet, among other distribution channels and platforms. At launch, we plan to have an iOS application, Android application and a C\u00dcR Music website.\nWe plan to source our music from MusicNet, Inc. d/b/a Media Net Digital, Inc. We also plan to use Amazon web services to support certain of the technological needs of the business.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we continued to pursue sources of equity and/or debt financing to support our operations. We were not successful in raising the necessary funds as of December 31, 2016. We cannot launch our music streaming product and platform until we have raised the necessary funds.\nRecent Developments\nDefaults under Agreements with Content Providers\nAs previously reported, the Company had entered into Music Label Agreements with certain Music Labels, pursuant to which the Company was provided limited, non-exclusive licenses to digitally distribute certain sound recordings and related materials owned or controlled by the Music Labels in connection with the Company's C\u00dcR-branded Internet music service, C\u00dcR Music, to be composed of three progressively priced and increasingly functional tiers, within the United States and its territories, commonwealths, and possessions.

The Music Label Agreements and Publishing Agreements may be collectively referred to herein as the \"Content Agreements,\" and the Music Labels and Music Publishers may be collectively referred to herein as the \"Content Providers.\u201d\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>55 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPursuant to the Content Agreements, the Company was required to pay certain minimum content fees over the term of the Content Agreements as follows: $14,000,000 in the first year of the agreements, of which approximately $8,000,000 was due on January 31, 2016, $25,500,000 in the second year of the agreements, and $18,500,000 in the third year of the agreements. The Content Providers previously agreed to provide the Company additional time to make the $8,000,000 in payments through both oral and written agreements. Under those agreements, the Company had until June 15, 2016 to make such payments. The Company paid an aggregate of $500,000 of the proceeds from the closing of the Secured Notes to the Content Providers.\nOn September 20, 2016, our Music Label Agreements with SME and UMG were terminated as a result of our failure to pay SME and UMG the advances due pursuant to such agreements. The Company also defaulted on its Music Label Agreement with WMG as a result of its failure to pay WMG the advance due pursuant to such agreement.\nThe Company issued the Content Providers warrants (\"Content Provider Warrants\") to purchase an aggregate of 215,279 shares (the \"Content Provider Warrant Shares\") of the Company's Common Stock at a weighted average exercise price of $6.41 per share.

We were unable to repay the noteholders at that time. Pursuant to the terms of the Secured Notes, our failure to pay any principal or interest within five (5) days of the date such payment was due constituted an event of default. Following the occurrence of an event of default, among other things, the interest rate on the Secured Notes increased to 15%. In addition to other remedies available to the noteholders, our obligation to repay amounts due under the Secured Notes is secured by a first priority security interest in and lien on all of our assets and property, including our intellectual property.\nSimultaneously with the Initial Closing (as defined below) of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering (as defined below), the holder of the Secured Note (the Secured Noteholders\u201d) assigned, conveyed, transferred and set over to CUR Holdings all of the Secured Noteholders' right, title, interest and obligations in, to and under the Secured Notes, and all claims, suits, causes of action and any other rights thereunder, to CUR Holdings.

Section 12(k) grants the SEC the right to suspend trading in a security.\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>56 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn accordance with SEC rules, on August 25, 2017, the Company made a written submission to the SEC in response to the Wells Notice, in which, among other things, it conveyed the Company's present intention to file the delinquent reports and become current with its SEC filing requirements and, as such, set forth the reasons why the proposed enforcement action should not be filed. While no assurances can be made, the Company believes that, as a result of making these filings, the SEC will have no further reason to institute the proposed administrative proceedings, or, if instituted, to continue such proceedings. However, there can be no assurance that the SEC will not bring an enforcement action against the Company, which could result in a trading suspension of the Company's Common Stock and the de-registration of the Company's securities under the Exchange Act.
