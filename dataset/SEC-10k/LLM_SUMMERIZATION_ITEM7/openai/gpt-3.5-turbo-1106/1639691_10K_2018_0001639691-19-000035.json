Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with the sections entitled Business\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the matters set forth in Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 ( 2017\u201d) and December 31, 2016 ( 2016\u201d).\nDescription of the Business\nWe are a global medical device company focused on the development and delivery of important therapeutic solutions for the benefit of patients, healthcare professionals and healthcare systems throughout the world. Working closely with medical professionals in the fields of CV disease and NM, we design, develop, manufacture and sell innovative therapeutic solutions that are consistent with our mission to improve our patients' quality of life, increase the skills and capabilities of healthcare professionals and minimize healthcare costs. We are a public limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales, and headquartered in London, England.\nBackground\nWe were organized under the laws of England and Wales on February 20, 2015 for the purpose of facilitating the business combination of Cyberonics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Sorin S.p.A., a joint stock company organized under the laws of Italy. The business combination became effective in October 2015. LivaNova's ordinary shares are listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol LIVN.\u201d\nBusiness Franchises\nLivaNova is comprised of two principal business franchises, which are also our reportable segments: CV and NM, corresponding to our primary therapeutic areas. Other corporate activities include corporate shared service expenses for finance, legal, human resources, information technology and New Ventures.\nCardiovascular Update\nOur CV business franchise is engaged in the development, production and sale of cardiopulmonary products, heart valves and advanced circulatory support products. Cardiopulmonary products include oxygenators, heart-lung machines, autotransfusion systems, perfusion tubing systems, cannulae and other related accessories. Heart valves include mechanical heart valves, tissue heart valves and related repair products. Advanced circulatory support, which represents our recently acquired TandemLife business, includes temporary life support product kits that can include a combination of pumps, oxygenators, and cannulae.\nCardiopulmonary\nIn September 2017, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for the U.S. market launch of our Optiflow Arterial Cannulae Family. Optiflow aortic arch cannulae provide improved hydrodynamics with a novel dispersive tip design that improves blood flow characteristics resulting in reduced wall shear stress ( WSS\u201d) profiles. Optiflow Arterial cannulae feature a unique basket tip with large openings that allow a more physiologically compatible dispersive design. This design has been shown to significantly reduce WSS and turbulence, thereby improving hydrodynamics and potentially reducing ischemic complications from extracorporeal circulation during cardiac surgery.\nProduct Remediation\nFDA Warning Letter\nOn December 29, 2015, the FDA issued a Warning Letter alleging certain violations of FDA regulations applicable to medical device manufacturers at our Munich, Germany and Arvada, Colorado facilities and issued inspectional observations on FDA's Form-483 applicable to our Munich, Germany facility.\nThe Warning Letter further stated that our 3T devices and other devices we manufactured at our Munich facility are subject to refusal of admission into the U.S. until resolution of the issues set forth by the FDA in the Warning Letter. The FDA has informed us that the import alert is limited to the 3T devices, but that the agency reserves the right to expand the scope of the import alert if future circumstances warrant such action. The Warning Letter did not request that existing users cease using the 3T device, and manufacturing and shipment of all of our products other than the 3T device remain unaffected by the import limitation. To help clarify these issues for current customers, we issued an informational Customer Letter in January 2016 and that same month agreed with the FDA on a process for shipping 3T devices to existing U.S. users pursuant to a certificate of medical necessity program.\nFinally, the Warning Letter stated that premarket approval applications for Class III devices to which certain Quality System regulation deviations identified in the Warning Letter are reasonably related will not be approved until the violations have been corrected; however, this restriction applies only to the Munich and Arvada facilities, which do not manufacture or design devices subject to Class III premarket approval.\nWe continue to work diligently to remediate the FDA's inspectional observations for the Munich facility, as well as the additional issues identified in the Warning Letter. We take these matters seriously and intend to respond timely and fully to the FDA's requests. For further information refer to Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC\u201d) and FDA Safety Communications, Company Field Safety Notice Update and Product Remediation Plan\nOn October 13, 2016, the CDC and the FDA separately released safety notifications regarding the 3T devices. The CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report ( MMWR\u201d) and Health Advisory Notice ( HAN\u201d) reported that tests conducted by the CDC and its affiliates indicate that there appears to be genetic similarity between both patient and 3T device strains of the non-tuberculous mycobacterium bacteria M. chimaera isolated in hospitals in Iowa and Pennsylvania. Citing the geographic separation between the two hospitals referenced in the investigation, the report asserts that 3T devices manufactured prior to August 18, 2014 could have been contaminated during the manufacturing process. The CDC's HAN and FDA's Safety Communication, issued contemporaneously with the MMWR report, each assess certain risks associated with 3T devices and provide guidance for providers and patients. The CDC notification states that the decision to use the 3T device during a surgical operation is to be taken by the surgeon based on a risk approach and on patient need. Both the CDC's and FDA's communications confirm that 3T devices are critical medical devices and enable doctors to perform life-saving cardiac surgery procedures.\nAlso on October 13, 2016, concurrent with the CDC's HAN and FDA's Safety Communication, we issued a Field Safety Notice Update for U.S. users of 3T devices to proactively and voluntarily contact facilities to aid in implementation of the CDC and FDA recommendations. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated a program to provide existing 3T device users with a new loaner 3T device at no charge pending regulatory approval and implementation of additional risk mitigation strategies worldwide, including a vacuum canister and internal sealing upgrade program and a deep disinfection service. This loaner program began in the U.S. and is being made available progressively on a global basis, prioritizing and allocating devices to 3T device users based on pre-established criteria. We anticipate that this program will continue until we are able to address customer needs through a broader solution that includes implementation of the risk mitigation strategies described above. We are currently implementing the vacuum and sealing upgrade program in as many countries as possible until all devices are upgraded. On April 12, 2018, the FDA agreed to allow us to move forward with the deep cleaning service in the U.S. adding to the growing list of countries around the world in which we offer this service. On October 11, 2018, after review of information provided by us, the FDA concluded that we could commence the vacuum and sealing upgrade program in the U.S. Furthermore, we continue to offer a no-charge deep disinfection service (deep cleaning service) for 3T device users as we receive the required regulatory approvals.\nOn December 31, 2016, we recognized a liability for our product remediation plan related to our 3T device. We concluded that it was probable that a liability had been incurred upon management's approval of the plan and the commitments made by management to various regulatory authorities globally in November and December 2016, and furthermore, the cost associated with the plan was reasonably estimable. At December 31, 2018, the product remediation liability was $14.7 million. For further information, refer to Note 7. Product Remediation Liability\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSale of our Suzhou Industrial Park Facility in Shanghai, China\nIn March 2017, we committed to a plan to sell our Suzhou Industrial Park facility in Shanghai, China, an emerging market greenfield project for the local manufacture of Cardiopulmonary disposable products. As a result of this exit plan, we recorded an impairment of the building and equipment of $5.4 million and accrued $0.5 million of additional costs, primarily related to employee severance, during the year ended December 31, 2017, which are included in \u2018Restructuring expenses' in our consolidated statement of income (loss). In addition, the land, building and equipment were recorded as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet, with a carrying value of $13.6 million as of December 31, 2017. We completed the sale of the Suzhou facility in April 2018 and received cash proceeds from the sale of $13.3 million.\nHeart Valves\nIn January 2018, we announced that we had started enrollment in our BELIEVE study. This study focuses on the overall incidence of reduced leaflet motion identified by CT imaging in patients receiving our aortic heart valve. We are planning to enroll a minimum of 75 patients at 11 sites in the U.S. and Canada.\nIn March 2018, we announced that we had started enrollment in PERFECT, a Perceval valve clinical study in China. The study is being conducted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of Perceval in the Chinese population. We plan to enroll up to 160 patients at 8 investigational sites.\nIn June 2018, we announced that Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare approved our Perceval sutureless aortic heart valve to treat aortic valve disease, which will enable us to provide patients and clinicians in Japan with a new option for aortic heart valve replacement. In January 2019, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare granted national reimbursement.\nIn June 2018, we announced FDA 510(k) clearance of the MEMO 4D semi-rigid mitral annuloplasty ring and confirmed the first implantation of the device. In October 2018, we received CE mark approval for Memo 4D. This next-generation of the MEMO device family offers several innovations, such as broader range of ring sizes, a new ring design and true semi-rigid stability and flexibility that allows us to reach a larger patient population with MR for treatment with the potential to improve patient outcomes.\nAdvanced Circulatory Support\nIn April 2018, we acquired TandemLife, which is focused on the delivery of leading-edge temporary life support products, including cardiopulmonary and respiratory support solutions. For further information, refer to Note 4. Business Combinations\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNeuromodulation Update\nOur NM business franchise designs, develops and markets NM therapy for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy, TRD and obstructive sleep apnea. We are also focused on the development and clinical testing of the VITARIA System for treating heart failure through vagus nerve stimulation.\nEpilepsy\nOur product development efforts are directed toward improving the VNS Therapy System and developing new products that provide additional features and functionality. We are conducting ongoing product development activities to enhance the VNS Therapy System pulse generator, lead and programming software, and we support studies for our product development efforts and to build clinical evidence for the VNS Therapy System.\nIn June 2017, the FDA approved our VNS Therapy device for use in patients who are at least four years of age and have partial onset seizures that are resistant to antiepileptic medications. VNS Therapy is the first and only FDA-approved device for drug-resistant epilepsy in this pediatric population. Previously, VNS Therapy was approved by the FDA for patients 12 years or older. In addition, in June 2017, we received FDA approval, and in August 2017, we received CE Mark approval, for our VNS Therapy device for expanded MRI labeling affirming VNS Therapy as the only epilepsy device approved by the FDA for MRI scans. Currently, SenTiva, AspireHC and AspireSR models of VNS Therapy technology provide for this expanded MRI access.\nIn October 2017, we obtained FDA approval and in April 2018, we received CE mark approval for our SenTiva VNS Therapy System, which consists of the SenTiva implantable generator and the next-generation VNS Therapy Programming System. SenTiva is the smallest and lightest responsive therapy for epilepsy. The new VNS Therapy Programming System features a wireless wand and new user interface on a small tablet. Together, these components offer patients with drug-resistant epilepsy a physician-directed, customizable therapy with smart technology that reduces the number of seizures, lessens the duration of seizures and enables a faster recovery.\nIn March 2018, we announced the launch and enrollment of the first patient in a clinical study to examine the use of our VNS Therapy System using Microburst technology. This feasibility study will determine the initial safety and effectiveness of delivering VNS Therapy using high frequency bursts of stimulation in patients who have drug-resistant epilepsy. The study consists of two cohorts, enrolling up to 40 patients at approximately 15 sites in the U.S. and Europe.\nIn August 2018, we announced a new cost analysis that found our VNS Therapy System results in lower resource utilization and lower cost for drug-resistant epilepsy patients when compared to continued treatment with anti-epileptic drugs. The analysis showed initial costs for the VNS Therapy device, including placement and programming, were estimated to be offset 1.7 years post-implant and equated to an estimated net cost savings of $77,480 per patient over five years. The net cost savings\nare due primarily to a reduction in seizure-related hospitalizations, resulting in a 21.5% decrease in costs compared to treatment with anti-epileptic drugs alone.\nDepression\nIn March 2017, the American Journal of Psychiatry published the results of the longest and largest naturalistic study on effective treatments for patients experiencing chronic and severe depression. The findings showed that the addition of VNS Therapy System to traditional treatment methods is effective in reducing symptoms in patients with TRD.\nIn January 2018, we announced the launch and enrollment of the first patient in our Global RESTORE-LIFE study, which evaluates the use of our VNS Therapy System in patients who have TRD and failed to achieve an adequate response to standard psychiatric management. We expect to enroll up to 500 patients at approximately 80 sites outside of the U.S. We are currently enrolling patients in Germany and will expand to other countries during the remainder of the year.\nIn July 2005, the FDA approved the VNS Therapy System for the adjunctive treatment of chronic or recurrent depression for patients 18 years or older who are experiencing a major depressive episode and have not had an adequate response to four or more antidepressant treatments. In May 2007, CMS issued a national determination of non-coverage within the U.S. with respect to reimbursement of the VNS Therapy System for patients with TRD, significantly limiting access to this therapeutic option for most patients. In May 2018, CMS published a tracking sheet to reconsider its National Coverage Determination ( NCD\u201d) of our VNS Therapy System for TRD in response to a letter that we submitted to CMS requesting a formal reconsideration of the NCD. We requested this review after a significant body of new evidence emerged about TRD and the role of VNS Therapy in its treatment. On February 15, 2019, we announced that CMS finalized its NCD to expand Medicare coverage for VNS Therapy for TRD. With the decision, CMS initiated coverage for Medicare beneficiaries through Coverage with Evidence Development when offered in a CMS-approved, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a follow-up duration of at least one year, with the possibility of extending the study to a prospective longitudinal study. We intend to commence a clinical study that meets these requirements. Enrollment will likely begin in the third quarter of 2019 and could take as long as 18 months to enroll approximately 500 patients.\nObstructive Sleep Apnea\nWe have invested in ImThera, a privately held, emerging-growth company developing an implantable neurostimulation device system for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, since 2011. On January 16, 2018, we acquired the remaining 86% outstanding equity interests in ImThera for up to approximately $225 million. Up-front costs were approximately $78 million with the balance paid on a schedule driven by regulatory and sales milestones. ImThera manufactures an implantable device that stimulates multiple tongue muscles via the hypoglossal nerve, which opens the airway while a patient is sleeping. ImThera has a commercial presence in the European market, and an FDA pivotal study is ongoing in the U.S.\nHeart Failure\nWe are focused on the development and clinical testing of the VITARIA System for treating heart failure through vagus nerve stimulation.\nWe received CE Mark approval of the VITARIA System in February 2015 for patients who have moderate to severe heart failure (New York Heart Association Class II/III) with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < 40%) and who remain symptomatic despite stable, optimal heart failure drug therapy. The VITARIA System provides a specific method of VNS called autonomic regulation therapy ( ART\u201d), and it includes the same elements as the VNS Therapy System. We conducted a pilot study, ANTHEM-HF, outside the U.S., which concluded in 2014. The study results support the safety and efficacy of ART delivered by the VITARIA System. During 2014, we also initiated a second pilot study, ANTHEM-HFPEF, to study ART in patients experiencing symptomatic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This pilot study is currently underway outside the U.S. The VITARIA System is not approved in the U.S.\nIn September 2018, we announced the first successful implantation of the VITARIA System in a patient enrolled in the ANTHEM-HFrEF pivotal study. ANTHEM-HFrEF is an international, multi-center, randomized trial to evaluate the VITARIA System for the treatment of advanced heart failure.\nCosta Rica Manufacturing Plant Closure\nIn October 2016, management initiated a plan to exit our Costa Rica manufacturing operations and transfer those activities to Houston, Texas. We recorded an impairment of the building and equipment of $5.7 million, which was included in restructuring expenses in our consolidated statement of income (loss). We completed the sale of the Costa Rica facility during the year ended December 31, 2017 and received $4.9 million in proceeds from the sale.\nDiscontinued Operations\nWe completed the sale of our CRM business franchise to MicroPort Cardiac Rhythm B.V. and MicroPort Scientific Corporation (the CRM Sale\u201d) on April 30, 2018 for total cash proceeds of $195.9 million, less cash transferred of $9.2 million, subject to a closing working capital adjustment. In conjunction with the CRM Sale, we entered into transition services agreements to provide certain support services generally for up to twelve months from the closing date of the sale. We previously concluded that the sale of CRM represents a strategic shift in our business that will have a major effect on future operations and financial results. Accordingly, the results of operations of the CRM business franchise are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and related assets and liabilities are presented as held for sale. For further information, refer to Note 5. Discontinued Operations\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCorporate Activities and New Ventures Update\nCorporate activities include shared services for finance, legal, human resources and information technology, corporate business development and New Ventures.\nMitral Valve Regurgitation\nMR occurs when the heart's mitral valve does not close tightly, which allows blood to flow backwards in the heart. This reduces the amount of blood that flows to the rest of the body, making the patient feel tired or out of breath. Treatment depends on the nature and the severity of MR. In certain cases, heart surgery may be needed to repair or replace the valve. Left untreated, severe MR can cause heart failure or heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias).\nOn May 2, 2017, we acquired the remaining 51% outstanding equity interests in Caisson, a clinical-stage medical device company focused on the design, development and clinical evaluation of a novel TMVR implant device with a fully transvenous delivery system for the treatment of MR for a purchase price of up to $72.0 million, in support of our strategic growth initiatives. As a result of our acquisition of Caisson, we began consolidating the results of Caisson as of May 2, 2017.\nIn April 2016, Caisson obtained FDA approval of an Investigational Device Exemption study using its technology for treating MR with TMVR and we are currently executing against a defined clinical data development plan designed to enable commercialization of the Caisson technology.\nIn August 2018, we announced the conclusion of our PRELUDE feasibility study of the TMVR system. The PRELUDE first-inhuman study evaluated the TMVR system to treat moderate to severe MR using a transseptal approach. This is a less invasive approach using a tube (catheter) through an incision in the groin, instead of an opening in the chest, to replace a patient's mitral valve. Following the positive patient outcomes from the PRELUDE study, we began enrolling patients in the INTERLUDE CE Mark trial.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we determined that a pause in enrollment of the INTERLUDE CE Mark trial would result in a delay in commercialization. This delay constituted a triggering event that required evaluation of the goodwill and IPR&D asset arising from the Caisson acquisition for impairment as of December 31, 2018. Based on the assessment performed, we determined that the goodwill and IPR&D asset were not impaired. A further delay or a change in management's estimates could result in a fair value that is below its carrying amount. We will continue to monitor any changes in circumstances for indicators of impairment.\nWe are also invested in two mitral valve startups, Cardiosolutions, Inc. ( Cardiosolutions\u201d) and Highlife S.A.S. ( Highlife\u201d). Cardiosolutions, a startup headquartered in the U.S. in which we have held an interest since 2012, is developing an innovative spacer technology for treating MR. Highlife, headquartered in France, is focused on developing devices for treating MR through percutaneous replacement of the native mitral valve. We recognized an impairment of our equity method investment in, and notes receivable from, Highlife during the year ended December 31, 2017, due to certain factors including a revision in our investment strategy that indicated that the carrying value of our aggregate investment might not be recoverable and that the decrease in value of our aggregate investment was other than temporary. We, therefore, estimated the fair value of our investment and notes receivable using the market approach and recorded an aggregate impairment of $13.0 million. For further information regarding Highlife, refer to Note 9. Investments\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCentral Sleep Apnea\nWe are invested in Respicardia Inc. ( Respicardia\u201d), a U.S.-based developer of implantable therapies designed to improve Respiratory Rhythm Management and cardiovascular health. Respicardia's remed\u0113 System is an implantable device system designed to restore a more natural breathing pattern during sleep in patients with central sleep apnea by transvenously\nstimulating the phrenic nerve. The remed\u0113 System received CE Mark certification in 2010 and in October 2017, Respicardia received U.S. FDA market approval. In September 2016, we elected not to exercise our option to purchase the outstanding shares of Respicardia as the investment no longer met our objective for substantial ongoing involvement taken into consideration with our overall portfolio management program. As a result, in September 2016, we recorded an impairment of $9.2 million equal to the amount of the carrying value of the option. In addition, we terminated our exclusive distribution agreement with Respicardia in November 2016. In December 2017, certain factors, including an additional round of external financing with a new investor, indicated that the carrying value of our investment might not be recoverable and the decrease in value of our investment was other than temporary. Our estimate of the fair value of our investment using the income approach was below our carrying value and as a result, we recorded an additional impairment of $5.5 million. This impairment was recorded in impairment of investments in our consolidated statement of income (loss).\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results for the years

Cardiopulmonary product sales increased year-over-year primarily due to strong heart-lung machine sales as customers continue to upgrade from our legacy S3 device to our current S5 device and as well as strong sales of the Inspire oxygenator. With respect to heart valves, the expected termination of a manufacturing contract resulted in a decrease in heart valve net sales of $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017. Additionally, increased sales of our Perceval sutureless aortic heart valves were more than offset by a non-recurring sales return reserve of $3.4 million recorded during 2018 and continuing global declines in traditional tissue heart valve and mechanical heart valve sales.\nCV segment operating income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to the $294.0 million litigation provision related to our 3T device that was recorded during 2018. Additionally, positive impacts to operating income associated with the increases in net sales was more than offset by increased sales and marketing expenses related to our efforts to expand market share in international markets, increased R&D investments in support of the next generation heart-lung machine and increased legal costs associated with our 3T litigation. The inclusion of the operating results of TandemLife also resulted in a $10.8 million decrease in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017.\nCV segment net sales increased $23.8 million, or 3.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due primarily to growth of $22.9 million in cardiopulmonary product revenue. Cardiopulmonary product sales increased year-over-year due to continued progress towards upgrading customers from our S3 heart-lung machines to our current S5 device, strong sales of our Inspire oxygenator and favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Heart valve sales increased by $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due to favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which more than offset continuing global declines in traditional tissue and mechanical heart valves.\nCV segment operating income increased by $64.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily driven by increased sales of $23.8 million combined with inventory fair value step-up amortization of $25.2 million that was recognized in 2016. The inventory fair value step-up was fully amortized by September 30, 2016.\nNeuromodulation\nEffective January 1, 2018, we began to include the results of heart failure within our NM segment for internal reporting purposes in order to manage and evaluate business activities for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. Segment results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 have been recast to conform to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNM segment net sales increased $48.0 million or 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to strong adoption of the SenTiva VNS Therapy System in the U.S. Net sales in 2018 also benefited from increased sales in Europe following the approval and launch of the SenTiva VNS Therapy System in April 2018, and strong growth in the Rest of world region despite the short-term impact of business model changes.\nNM segment operating income slightly increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increased sales, partially offset by increased marketing expenses related to efforts to market direct to consumer, increased R&D expenses for new projects surrounding our SenTiva VNS Therapy System, TRD and heart failure and the inclusion of the operating results of ImThera in 2018 which represented a loss of $8.8 million.\nNM segment net sales increased $23.6 million, or 6.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to strong demand for the AspireSR VNS Therapy System and the launch of the SenTiva VNS Therapy System in October 2017.\nThe increase in NM segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily driven by increased operating leverage as a result of higher net sales, partially offset by the increased costs associated with sales force expansion and marketing efforts in the U.S.\nCosts and Expenses\nThe table below illustrates our costs and expenses as a percentage of net sales:\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales - exclusive of amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product remediation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger and integration expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Litigation provision\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales consisted primarily of direct labor, allocated manufacturing overhead, the acquisition cost of raw materials and components.\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 32.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of 2.2% as compared to 2017. This decrease was primarily due to product mix, pricing discipline and our focus on cost efficiencies.\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 34.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 3.2% as compared to 2016. This decrease was due to the decrease in amortization of inventory written-up to fair value in the merger of Sorin and Cyberonics related to the CV segment of $25.2 million, which accounted for 2.6% of net sales for 2016. The inventory fair value step-up was fully amortized by September 30, 2016.\nProduct Remediation\nProduct remediation as a percentage of net sales was 1.0%, 0.7% and 3.9% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Product remediation expenses include internal labor costs, costs to remediate certain inspectional observations made by the FDA at our Munich facility and costs associated with the incorporation of the modification of the 3T device design into the next generation heater cooler device. Product remediation expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 also include $37.5 million for the recognition of the product remediation plan liability.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses\nSG&A expenses are comprised of sales, marketing, general and administrative activities. SG&A expenses exclude expenses incurred in connection with the merger between Cyberonics and Sorin, integration costs after the merger and restructuring costs under the restructuring plans initiated after the merger.\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily due to key growth driver investments in the U.S., including efforts to market directly to consumers within our NM business, acquisition costs and additional SG&A costs from the acquisitions of TandemLife and ImThera. Increased sales and marketing expenses internationally for general market expansion, increased litigation expenses primarily related to our 3T devices and the overall strengthening of our organizational capabilities to support growth also contributed to the increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales.\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 0.7% to 37.5% as compared to the 2016. This increase was largely attributable to litigation expenses related to our 3T devices, costs associated with acquisitions and other legal matters.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nR&D expenses consist of product design and development efforts, clinical study programs and regulatory activities, which are essential to our strategic portfolio initiatives, including TMVR, TRD, obstructive sleep apnea and heart failure.\nR&D expenses as a percentage of net sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily due to additional R&D expenses for our development of next generation products, including heart-lung machines, the SenTiva VNS Therapy System and TandemLife and clinical trials and investments in TRD, TMVR, obstructive sleep apnea and heart failure.\nR&D expenses as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 2.3% to 10.8% as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Caisson in May 2017, inclusive of $5.8 million in post-combination compensation expense recognized concurrent with the acquisition of Caisson, and $7.2 million in compensation expense associated with the retention of the employees of Caisson. The additional increase as compared to the prior year was due to increased investment in clinical and registries pertaining to TMVR and heart failure.\nMerger and Integration ( M&I\u201d) Expenses\nM&I expenses consist primarily of costs associated with computer systems integration efforts, organizational structure integration, synergy and tax planning. M&I expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 0.7% to 2.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to costs associated with efforts to improve and standardize product pricing and procurement strategies.\nRestructuring Expenses\nOur restructuring plans leverage economies of scale, eliminate duplicate corporate expenses and streamline distributions, logistics and office functions in order to reduce overall costs. Restructuring expenses are detailed in Note 6. Restructuring\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our 2015 and 2016 Reorganization Plans (the Prior Plans\u201d) were initiated in October 2015 and March 2016, respectively, in conjunction with the completion of the merger of Sorin and Cyberonics. The Prior Plans included the Costa Rica manufacturing operation exit plan, initiated in December 2016 and completed during 2017, and the Suzhou, China exit plan, initiated in March 2017 and completed during 2018.\nThe decline in restructuring expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year was due to a decrease in restructuring activities.\nAmortization of Intangibles\nAmortization of intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, consisted primarily of amortization of intellectual property and customer relationships acquired at fair value in the merger of Sorin and Cyberonics on October 19, 2015. Amortization of $37.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $4.1 million as compared to 2017, due primarily to the amortization of intangible assets recognized as part of the acquisition of TandemLife in April 2018.\nLitigation Provision\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a $294.0 million litigation provision involving our 3T device. For further information, refer to Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInterest Expense\nWe incurred interest expense of $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $7.8 million and $10.6 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase for the year December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to increased debt borrowings in 2018 while the decrease noted for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to a reduction in income tax related interest expense for our inter-company sale of intellectual property for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year, as a result of a reduction in the income tax liability.\nGain on Acquisitions\nOn January 16, 2018, we acquired the remaining outstanding interest of ImThera. On the acquisition date, we remeasured our existing investment in ImThera at fair value and recognized a pre-tax non-cash gain of $11.5 million.\nOn May 2, 2017, we acquired the remaining 51% equity interests in Caisson. On the acquisition date, we remeasured our notes receivable due from Caisson and our existing investment in Caisson at fair value and recognized a pre-tax non-cash gain of $1.3 million and $38.1 million, respectively.\nImpairment of Investments\nIn 2017, we impaired our investments in Respicardia and Rainbow Medical Ltd., in the amounts of $5.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively. For further information, refer to Note 9. Investments\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nForeign Exchange ( FX\u201d) and Other\nDue to the global nature of our operations, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign exchange and other losses were $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, consisting of FX losses associated with intercompany debt and third-party financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency derivative contracts established to hedge against exchange rate movements.\nForeign exchange and other gains were $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, consisting of FX losses of $2.9 million offset by a $3.2 million gain on the sale of our equity investment in Istituto Europeo di Oncologia S.R.L.\nForeign Exchange and other gains consisted of FX gains of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of our intercompany debt and third-party financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency derivative contracts established to hedge against exchange rate movements.\nIncome Taxes\nLivaNova PLC is domiciled and resident in the UK. Our subsidiaries conduct operations and earn income in numerous countries and are subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries, and the income tax rates imposed in the tax jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries conduct operations vary. As a result of the changes in the overall level of our income, the earnings mix in various jurisdictions and the changes in tax laws, our consolidated effective income tax rate may vary substantially from one reporting period to another.\nOur effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 28.1% compared with 41.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our effective income tax rate fluctuates based on, among other factors, changes in pretax income in countries with varying statutory tax rates, changes in valuation allowances, changes in tax credits and incentives and changes in unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions.\nCompared with the year ended December 31, 2017, the decrease in the effective tax rate for 2018 was primarily attributable to the impact of the reduction to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, the repeal of the U.S. domestic production activity deduction, certain tax law changes in the UK that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2017, the 2018 acquisitions of Imthera Medical Inc. and CardiacAssist, Inc., the sale of CRM, audit settlements in Italy and Germany and the impact of other discrete tax items.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded income tax expense from continuing operations of $50.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively, with effective income tax rates of 41.2% and 19.9%, respectively.\nOur 41.2% effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 included the impact of various discrete tax items, including the non-cash net charge of $27.5 million recorded as a result of the Tax Act and the acquisition of Caisson, inclusive of the $38.1 million non-taxable gain recognized to re-measure our existing equity investments in Caisson at fair value on the acquisition date.\nOur 19.9% effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the impact of various discrete tax items, primarily related to a reduction in valuation allowances in the U.S. related to capital loss carryforwards, partially offset by an increase in tax expense related to an unrecognized tax benefit from a tax position taken in prior years.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nThe Tax Act, which is also commonly referred to as U.S. tax reform,\u201d significantly changed U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21%, which commenced in 2018.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we finalized our accounting under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 for the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities and impairment of foreign tax credits related to the Tax Act. Our accounting for the remeasurement is complete with a final non-cash net charge of $21.0 million.\nThe Tax Act also established various other new U.S. corporate income tax laws that came into effect in 2018 along with proposed regulations issued in 2018. The extent to which these and other provisions of the Tax Act, or future legislation or final regulations clarifying the Tax Act, could impact our consolidated effective income tax rate in future periods depends on many factors including, but not limited to, the amount of profit generated by our subsidiaries operating in the U.S., the impact of the Company's current or contemplated tax planning strategies, the impact of new or amended tax laws or regulations by the U.S. and by countries outside the U.S., and other factors beyond our control.\nBrexit\nOn June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit.\u201d On March 29, 2017, the UK government gave formal notice of its intention to leave the EU, formally commencing the negotiations regarding the terms of withdrawal between the UK and the EU. Negotiations between the UK and the EU continue about provisions of the withdrawal agreement. Unless the deadline is extended, the UK will leave the EU on March 29, 2019. Although the long-term effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the UK makes to retain access to the EU markets, Brexit has created additional uncertainties that may ultimately result in new regulatory costs and challenges for medical device companies and increased restrictions on imports and exports throughout Europe. This could adversely affect our ability to conduct and expand our operations in Europe and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe notification does not change the application of existing tax laws and does not establish a clear framework for what the ultimate outcome of the negotiations and legislative process will be. Various tax reliefs and exemptions that apply to transactions between EU Member States under existing tax laws may cease to apply to transactions between the UK and EU Member States when the UK ultimately withdraws from the EU. It is unclear at this stage if or when any new tax treaties between the UK and the EU or individual EU Member States will replace those reliefs and exemptions. It is also unclear at this stage what financial, trade and legal implications will ensue from Brexit and how Brexit may ultimately affect us, our customers, suppliers, vendors, or our industry.\nWe and several of our wholly owned subsidiaries that are domiciled either in the UK, various EU Member States, or in the U.S., are party to intercompany transactions and agreements under which we receive various tax reliefs and exemptions in accordance with applicable international tax laws, treaties and regulations. If certain treaties applicable to our transactions and agreements change materially, Brexit may have a material adverse impact on our future financial results and results of operations. We continue to monitor and assess the potential impact of this event and explore possible tax-planning strategies that may mitigate or eliminate potential adverse impacts.\nWe will not account for the impact of Brexit in our income tax provisions until changes in tax laws or treaties between the UK and the EU or individual EU Member States with the UK and/or the U.S. are enacted, or the withdrawal becomes effective.\nEuropean Union State Aid Challenge\nOn October 26, 2017, the European Commission ( EC\u201d) announced that an investigation will be opened with respect to the UK's controlled foreign company ( CFC\u201d) rules. The CFC rules under investigation provide certain tax exceptions to entities controlled by UK parent companies that are subject to lower tax rates if the activities being undertaken by the CFC relate to financing. The EC is investigating whether the exemption is a breach of EU State Aid rules. The investigation is estimated to be completed during the quarter ended March 31, 2019, with an appeal process likely to follow. It is unclear as to whether the UK will be part of the EU once a decision has been finalized due to Brexit and what impact, if any, Brexit will have on the outcome of the investigation or the enforceability of a decision. Due to the many uncertainties related to this matter, including the state of the investigation, the pending Brexit negotiations and political environment and the unknown outcome of the investigation and resulting appeals, no uncertain tax position reserve has been recognized related to this matter and we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential liability.\nLosses from Equity Method Investments\nDue to an additional investment by a third party during the year ended December 31, 2018, our equity interest in Highlife decreased to 7.8% from 24.6%. We determined that we no longer had significant influence over Highlife and, as a result, we began to measure Highlife at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Losses from equity method investments were $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was attributable to Highlife. Losses for the year ended December\n31, 2017 of $16.7 million were due primarily to the impairment of our investment in, and notes receivable from, Highlife of $13.0 million.\nWe recognized losses from equity method investments of $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to investee losses of Caisson, Highlife and Respicardia and the impairment of our investment in Respicardia of $9.2 million. In November 2016, we terminated our distributor agreement with Respicardia. The distributor agreement had been a key component in the determination of whether our influence over Respicardia was significant and, as a result, we determined that we no longer had significant influence over Respicardia.\nResults of Discontinued Operations\nThe table below illustrates the results of discontinued operations (in thousands):\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,937\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,271\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(64,663\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(78,283\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,937\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(79,554\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(64,663\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe completed the CRM Sale on April 30, 2018, for total cash proceeds of $195.9 million, less cash transferred of $9.2 million, subject to a closing working capital adjustment. In conjunction with the sale, we entered into transition services agreements to provide certain support services generally for up to twelve months from the closing date of the sale. The services include, among others, accounting, information technology, human resources, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, supply chain, clinical affairs and customer support. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized income of $2.8 million for providing these services. Income recognized related to the transition services agreements is recorded as a reduction to the related expenses in the associated expense line items in our consolidated statement of income (loss).\nIn November 2017, we concluded that the sale of CRM represented a strategic shift in our business that would have a major effect on future operations and financial results. Accordingly, the operating results of CRM are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income (loss) for all the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The assets and liabilities of CRM are presented as assets or liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2017 in Note 5. Discontinued Operations\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, we tested the long-lived assets of CRM for impairment and recognized an impairment to tangible and intangible assets of $78.3 million, net of a $15.3 million tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates\nWe have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). Our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. New accounting pronouncements are disclosed in Note 22. New Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTo prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation, or if materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas requiring management's judgment that we consider critical:\nBusiness Combinations and Goodwill\nWe allocate the amounts we pay for an acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including property, plant and equipment, inventories, accounts receivable, long-term debt, and identifiable intangible assets which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. We base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including IPR&D, on valuations that use\ninformation and assumptions provided by management, which consider management's best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill. Transaction costs associated with these acquisitions are expensed as incurred and are reported in selling, general and administrative on the consolidated statements of income (loss). We recognize adjustments to the provisional amounts identified during the measurement period with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts are recorded in the same period's consolidated financial statements, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.\nIntangible Assets, Other than Goodwill\nIntangible assets shown on the consolidated balance sheets consist of finite-lived and indefinite-lived assets expected to generate future economic benefits and are recorded at their respective fair values as of their acquisition date. Finite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology and technical capabilities, including patents, related know-how and licensed patent rights, trade names, customer relationships and favorable leases acquired in acquisitions. Customer relationships consist of relationships with hospitals and cardiac surgeons in the countries where we operate. Indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill are composed of IPR&D assets acquired in acquisitions. We estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets, which requires significant management judgment. We amortize our finite-lived intangible assets over their useful lives using the straight-line method.\nAmortization expense is disclosed separately on our consolidated statements of income (loss). We evaluate our intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances indicate either a different useful life or impairment. If we change our estimate of the useful life of an asset, we amortize the carrying amount over the revised remaining useful life.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nWe review, when circumstances warrant, the carrying amounts of our property and equipment and our intangible assets to determine whether such carrying amounts continue to be recoverable. Such changes in circumstance may include, among other items, an expectation of a sale or disposal of a long-lived asset or asset group, adverse changes in market or competitive conditions, an adverse change in legal factors or business climate in the markets in which we operate and operating or cash flow losses. For purposes of impairment testing, long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities, generally at or below the reporting unit level. If the carrying amount of the asset or asset group is greater than the expected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by such asset or asset group, an impairment adjustment is recognized. Such adjustment is measured by the amount that the carrying value of such asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. We generally measure fair value by considering sale prices for similar assets, discounted estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate and/or estimated replacement cost. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of their financial statement carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nWe evaluate the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually on October 1st and whenever other facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. In the case of goodwill, if it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its respective carrying amount. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component\u201d). Our operating segments are deemed to be our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, we would then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying amount, and any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value would be charged to operations as an impairment loss. With respect to indefinite-lived intangible assets, if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we then estimate its fair value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is also charged to operations as an impairment loss.\nRevenue\nFor the years presented in our consolidated statements of income (loss) prior to December 31, 2018, we recognized revenue under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. We recognized revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement existed, title to the goods and risk of loss transferred to the customer or to an independent distributor, the selling price was fixed or determinable and collectability was reasonably assured. We estimated expected sales returns based on historical data and recorded a reduction of sales with a return reserve. We recorded state and local sales taxes net; that is, we excluded sales tax from revenue. Service related revenue was recognized on the basis of progress of the services, when services were rendered, when collectability was reasonably assured and when the amount was fixed and determinable.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASC Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Update No. 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance. We adopted the new revenue guidance on January 1, 2018. We elected the cumulative effect transition method; however, we recognized no cumulative effect to the opening balance of retained earnings because the impact on the timing of when revenue is recognized was insignificant.\nWe generate our revenue through contracts with customers. Our customers are primarily hospitals, healthcare institutions, distributors and other organizations. Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties, such as sales tax. We measure the consideration based upon the estimated amount to be received. The amount of consideration we ultimately receive varies depending upon the return terms, sales rebates, discounts, and other incentives that we may offer, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. The estimate of variable consideration requires significant judgment.\nWe recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of a product, or providing service, to a customer. Some of our contracts include the purchase of multiple products and/or services. In such cases, we allocate the transaction price based upon the relative estimated stand-alone price of each product and/or service sold. Typically, our contracts do not have a significant financing component. We have historically experienced a low rate of product returns and the total dollar value of product returns has not been significant to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe incur incremental commission fees paid to the sales force associated with the sale of products. We elected the practical expedient within ASC 606-10-50-22 and recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset the entity would otherwise recognize is one year or less. As a result, no commissions are capitalized as contract costs at December 31, 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are a UK corporation, and we operate through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. Our provision for income taxes is based on the tax laws and rates applicable in the jurisdictions in which we operate and earn income. We use significant judgment and estimates in accounting for our income taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the anticipated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statements basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities, which are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nWe file federal and local tax returns in many jurisdictions throughout the world and are subject to income tax examinations for our fiscal year 1998 and subsequent years, with certain exceptions. While we believe that our tax return positions are fully supported, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and as a result, we may establish reserves for uncertain tax positions, which require a significant degree of management judgment. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our tax positions in order to determine the appropriateness of our reserves; however, the actual outcome of an audit can be significantly different than our expectations, which could have a material impact on our tax provision. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefit, as of December 31, 2018, if recognized, would reduce our income tax expense by approximately $19.7 million. Our tax positions are evaluated for recognition using a more-likely-than-not threshold. Uncertain tax positions requiring recognition are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Some of the reasons a reserve for an uncertain tax position may be reversed are: completion of a tax audit; a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance; or an expiration of the statute of limitations. We recognize interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits and record interest in interest expense, and penalties in selling, general and administrative expense, in our consolidated statements of income (loss).\nWe periodically assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the actual benefit of those assets will be realized. To the extent that realization does not meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d criterion, we establish a valuation allowance. We periodically review the adequacy and necessity of the valuation allowance by considering significant positive and negative evidence relative to our ability to recover deferred tax assets and to determine the timing and amount of valuation allowance that should be released. This evidence includes: profitability in the most recent quarters; internal forecasts for the current and next two future years; size of deferred tax asset relative to estimated profitability; the potential effects on future profitability from increasing competition, healthcare reforms and overall economic conditions; limitations and potential limitations on the use of our net operating losses due to ownership changes, pursuant to IRC Section 382; and the implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, if any.\nThe Tax Act also established various other new U.S. corporate income tax laws that came into effect in 2018 along with proposed regulations issued in 2018. The extent to which these and other provisions of the Tax Act, or future legislation or final\nregulations clarifying the Tax Act, could impact our consolidated effective income tax rate in future periods depends on many factors including, but not limited to, the amount of profit generated by our subsidiaries operating in the U.S., the impact of the Company's current or contemplated tax planning strategies, the impact of new or amended tax laws or regulations by the U.S. and by countries outside the U.S., and other factors beyond our control. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we finalized our accounting under SAB 118 for the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities and impairment of foreign tax credits related to the Tax Act. Our accounting for the remeasurement is complete with a final non-cash net charge of $21.0 million.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of new accounting standards and disclosure requirements, please refer to Note 22. New Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that LivaNova will continue as a going concern. As further discussed in Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d the Company has recorded a $294.1 million litigation provision liability based on managements' best estimate, of which $161.9 million is anticipated to be paid during 2019 and the majority of the remainder is expected to be paid in the first half of 2020. In connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,\u201d the Company determined that collectively the payments of the $294.1 million liability and the $23.3 million of current debt obligations represent a condition that raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as the Company does not have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations as they come due. However, on February 25, 2019, the Company received $350.0 million in aggregate financing commitments pursuant to a commitment letter from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas and Intesa Sanpaolo for a debt facility (the Commitment Letter\u201d), the closing of which is subject to certain conditions. Management anticipates the financing to be executed no later than April 26, 2019. Management has concluded that the anticipated execution of the debt facility agreement based on the Commitment Letter, when combined with current and anticipated future operating cash flows, alleviates the substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern over the 12 month period from the issuance date of these financial statements given management has concluded that it is probable that the financing will be executed.\nPursuant to the Commitment Letter, the Company appoints each of the Banks as a mandated lead arranger, underwriter and bookrunner in respect of a multicurrency term loan facility (the Facility\u201d) in the aggregate amount of $350 million.\nThe commitment of the Banks to arrange and underwrite the Facility is made subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including, but not limited to the following: (a) compliance by the Company with all the terms of the Commitment Letter, the appended term sheet, and the fee letter in respect of fees owed to the Banks (the Fee Letter\u201d) (one such condition precedent being the repayment of any funds drawn under the 2018 $70 million revolving facility made available by Barclays Bank PLC), (b) accuracy and completeness of the Company (or group company) representations and warranties required by each of the Commitment Letter, the associated term sheet and the Fee Letter, (c) the execution and delivery of the agreement in respect of the Facility and associated documents no later than April 26, 2019 and (d) satisfactory completion of client identification procedures.\nPursuant to the Fee Letter, the Company is obligated to pay certain fees to the Banks.\nBased on our current business plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, future cash generated from operations and borrowing under the Commitment Letter will be sufficient to fund our expected operating needs, working capital requirements, R&D opportunities, capital expenditures, obligations anticipated for the litigation involving our 3T device and debt service requirements over the 12-month period beginning from the issuance date of these financial statements.

Non-cash items were principally composed of $85.4 million in depreciation and amortization and $19.6 million in stock-based compensation.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $67.7 million as compared to 2017. The increase primarily resulted from an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $265.5 million, partially offset by cash received from the sale of CRM of $186.7 million and an increase in proceeds from asset sales of $8.3 million.\nCash used in investing activities was $52.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. We invested $34.1 million in property, plant and equipment. We also utilized cash of $27.9 million related to our investments in privately held medical start-up companies, which included the purchase of the 51% of the remaining interest in Caisson utilizing cash of $14.2 million, and investments in, and loans to, our equity investees of $13.7 million.\nCash used in investing activities was $44.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to $38.4 million invested in property, plant and equipment and investments in, and loans to, our equity investees of $14.3 million. These amounts were partially offset by the transfer of $7.0 million to cash and cash equivalents from short-term investments.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $53.6 million as compared to 2017, primarily due to $50.0 million in cash used to repurchase shares in 2018 under a publicly announced repurchase plan and a $13.0 million payment for deferred consideration related to an acquisition, partially offset by an increase in net borrowings of $17.3 million.\nCash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $11.3 million, which included $32.4 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and repayment of long-term debt of $22.8 million.\nCash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $118.0 million, which included $54.5 million to repurchase shares under a publicly announced repurchase plan, a $33.7 million reduction in revolving credit facilities, repayment of advances on customer receivables of $23.8 million and repayment of long-term debt of $21.1 million. We also borrowed $7.2 million in additional long-term debt.\nDebt and Capital\nOur capital structure consists of debt and equity. As of December 31, 2018, our total debt of $168.3 million was 11.2% of total equity of $1.5 billion. At December 31, 2017, our total debt of $146.0 million was 8.0% of total equity of $1.8 billion.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we reduced our outstanding revolving credit facilities by $50.7 million, repaid $23.8 million of long-term debt obligations and borrowed $103.6 million in additional long-term debt.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we increased our outstanding revolving credit facilities by $32.4 million, repaid $22.8 million of long-term debt obligations and borrowed $2.0 million in additional long-term debt.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we reduced our outstanding revolving credit facilities by $33.7 million, repaid $21.1 million of long-term debt obligations and borrowed $7.2 million in additional long-term debt.\nFactoring\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we reduced our obligation for advances on customer receivables by $23.8 million, thereby eliminating this form of financing.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have various contractual commitments that we expect to fund from existing cash, future operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. The actual timing of the clinical commitment payments may vary based on the completion of milestones which are beyond our control.

We maintain a foreign currency exchange rate risk management strategy that utilizes derivatives to reduce our exposure to unanticipated fluctuations in forecast revenue and costs and fair values of debt, inter-company debt and accounts receivable caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe mitigate our credit risk relating to counter-parties of our derivatives through a variety of techniques, including transacting with multiple, high-quality financial institutions, thereby limiting our exposure to individual counter-parties and by entering into International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ( ISDA\u201d) Master Agreements, which include provisions for a legally enforceable master netting agreement, with almost all of our derivative counter-parties. The terms of the ISDA agreements may also include credit support requirements, cross default provisions, termination events, and set-off provisions. Legally enforceable master netting agreements reduce credit risk by providing protection in bankruptcy in certain circumstances and generally permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counter-party upon the occurrence of certain events.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to interest rate risk on our investments and debt. We manage a portion of our interest rate risk with contracts that swap floating-rate interest payments for fixed rate interest payments. If interest rates were to increase or decrease by 0.5%, the effects on our consolidated statement of income (loss) would not be material.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nOur trade accounts receivable represent potential concentrations of credit risk. This risk is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas, as well as our efforts to control our exposure to credit risk by monitoring our receivables and the use of credit approvals and credit limits. In addition, we have historically had strong collections and minimal write-offs. While we believe that our reserves for credit losses are adequate, essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the hospital and healthcare sectors worldwide, and accordingly, we are exposed to their respective business, economic and country-specific variables. Although we do not currently foresee a concentrated credit risk associated with these receivables, repayment is dependent on the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries' national economies and healthcare systems.\nFactors Affecting Future Operating Results and Share Price\nThe factors affecting our future operating results and share prices are disclosed in Item 1A.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with the sections entitled Business\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the matters set forth in Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 ( 2017\u201d) and December 31, 2016 ( 2016\u201d).\nDescription of the Business\nWe are a global medical device company focused on the development and delivery of important therapeutic solutions for the benefit of patients, healthcare professionals and healthcare systems throughout the world. Working closely with medical professionals in the fields of CV disease and NM, we design, develop, manufacture and sell innovative therapeutic solutions that are consistent with our mission to improve our patients' quality of life, increase the skills and capabilities of healthcare professionals and minimize healthcare costs. We are a public limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales, and headquartered in London, England.\nBackground\nWe were organized under the laws of England and Wales on February 20, 2015 for the purpose of facilitating the business combination of Cyberonics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Sorin S.p.A., a joint stock company organized under the laws of Italy. The business combination became effective in October 2015. LivaNova's ordinary shares are listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol LIVN.\u201d\nBusiness Franchises\nLivaNova is comprised of two principal business franchises, which are also our reportable segments: CV and NM, corresponding to our primary therapeutic areas. Other corporate activities include corporate shared service expenses for finance, legal, human resources, information technology and New Ventures.\nCardiovascular Update\nOur CV business franchise is engaged in the development, production and sale of cardiopulmonary products, heart valves and advanced circulatory support products. Cardiopulmonary products include oxygenators, heart-lung machines, autotransfusion systems, perfusion tubing systems, cannulae and other related accessories. Heart valves include mechanical heart valves, tissue heart valves and related repair products. Advanced circulatory support, which represents our recently acquired TandemLife business, includes temporary life support product kits that can include a combination of pumps, oxygenators, and cannulae.\nCardiopulmonary\nIn September 2017, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for the U.S. market launch of our Optiflow Arterial Cannulae Family. Optiflow aortic arch cannulae provide improved hydrodynamics with a novel dispersive tip design that improves blood flow characteristics resulting in reduced wall shear stress ( WSS\u201d) profiles. Optiflow Arterial cannulae feature a unique basket tip with large openings that allow a more physiologically compatible dispersive design. This design has been shown to significantly reduce WSS and turbulence, thereby improving hydrodynamics and potentially reducing ischemic complications from extracorporeal circulation during cardiac surgery.\nProduct Remediation\nFDA Warning Letter\nOn December 29, 2015, the FDA issued a Warning Letter alleging certain violations of FDA regulations applicable to medical device manufacturers at our Munich, Germany and Arvada, Colorado facilities and issued inspectional observations on FDA's Form-483 applicable to our Munich, Germany facility.\nThe Warning Letter further stated that our 3T devices and other devices we manufactured at our Munich facility are subject to refusal of admission into the U.S. until resolution of the issues set forth by the FDA in the Warning Letter. The FDA has informed us that the import alert is limited to the 3T devices, but that the agency reserves the right to expand the scope of the import alert if future circumstances warrant such action. The Warning Letter did not request that existing users cease using the 3T device, and manufacturing and shipment of all of our products other than the 3T device remain unaffected by the import limitation. To help clarify these issues for current customers, we issued an informational Customer Letter in January 2016 and that same month agreed with the FDA on a process for shipping 3T devices to existing U.S. users pursuant to a certificate of medical necessity program.\nFinally, the Warning Letter stated that premarket approval applications for Class III devices to which certain Quality System regulation deviations identified in the Warning Letter are reasonably related will not be approved until the violations have been corrected; however, this restriction applies only to the Munich and Arvada facilities, which do not manufacture or design devices subject to Class III premarket approval.\nWe continue to work diligently to remediate the FDA's inspectional observations for the Munich facility, as well as the additional issues identified in the Warning Letter. We take these matters seriously and intend to respond timely and fully to the FDA's requests. For further information refer to Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC\u201d) and FDA Safety Communications, Company Field Safety Notice Update and Product Remediation Plan\nOn October 13, 2016, the CDC and the FDA separately released safety notifications regarding the 3T devices. The CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report ( MMWR\u201d) and Health Advisory Notice ( HAN\u201d) reported that tests conducted by the CDC and its affiliates indicate that there appears to be genetic similarity between both patient and 3T device strains of the non-tuberculous mycobacterium bacteria M. chimaera isolated in hospitals in Iowa and Pennsylvania. Citing the geographic separation between the two hospitals referenced in the investigation, the report asserts that 3T devices manufactured prior to August 18, 2014 could have been contaminated during the manufacturing process. The CDC's HAN and FDA's Safety Communication, issued contemporaneously with the MMWR report, each assess certain risks associated with 3T devices and provide guidance for providers and patients. The CDC notification states that the decision to use the 3T device during a surgical operation is to be taken by the surgeon based on a risk approach and on patient need. Both the CDC's and FDA's communications confirm that 3T devices are critical medical devices and enable doctors to perform life-saving cardiac surgery procedures.\nAlso on October 13, 2016, concurrent with the CDC's HAN and FDA's Safety Communication, we issued a Field Safety Notice Update for U.S. users of 3T devices to proactively and voluntarily contact facilities to aid in implementation of the CDC and FDA recommendations. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated a program to provide existing 3T device users with a new loaner 3T device at no charge pending regulatory approval and implementation of additional risk mitigation strategies worldwide, including a vacuum canister and internal sealing upgrade program and a deep disinfection service. This loaner program began in the U.S. and is being made available progressively on a global basis, prioritizing and allocating devices to 3T device users based on pre-established criteria. We anticipate that this program will continue until we are able to address customer needs through a broader solution that includes implementation of the risk mitigation strategies described above. We are currently implementing the vacuum and sealing upgrade program in as many countries as possible until all devices are upgraded. On April 12, 2018, the FDA agreed to allow us to move forward with the deep cleaning service in the U.S. adding to the growing list of countries around the world in which we offer this service. On October 11, 2018, after review of information provided by us, the FDA concluded that we could commence the vacuum and sealing upgrade program in the U.S. Furthermore, we continue to offer a no-charge deep disinfection service (deep cleaning service) for 3T device users as we receive the required regulatory approvals.\nOn December 31, 2016, we recognized a liability for our product remediation plan related to our 3T device. We concluded that it was probable that a liability had been incurred upon management's approval of the plan and the commitments made by management to various regulatory authorities globally in November and December 2016, and furthermore, the cost associated with the plan was reasonably estimable. At December 31, 2018, the product remediation liability was $14.7 million. For further information, refer to Note 7. Product Remediation Liability\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSale of our Suzhou Industrial Park Facility in Shanghai, China\nIn March 2017, we committed to a plan to sell our Suzhou Industrial Park facility in Shanghai, China, an emerging market greenfield project for the local manufacture of Cardiopulmonary disposable products. As a result of this exit plan, we recorded an impairment of the building and equipment of $5.4 million and accrued $0.5 million of additional costs, primarily related to employee severance, during the year ended December 31, 2017, which are included in \u2018Restructuring expenses' in our consolidated statement of income (loss). In addition, the land, building and equipment were recorded as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet, with a carrying value of $13.6 million as of December 31, 2017. We completed the sale of the Suzhou facility in April 2018 and received cash proceeds from the sale of $13.3 million.\nHeart Valves\nIn January 2018, we announced that we had started enrollment in our BELIEVE study. This study focuses on the overall incidence of reduced leaflet motion identified by CT imaging in patients receiving our aortic heart valve. We are planning to enroll a minimum of 75 patients at 11 sites in the U.S. and Canada.\nIn March 2018, we announced that we had started enrollment in PERFECT, a Perceval valve clinical study in China. The study is being conducted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of Perceval in the Chinese population. We plan to enroll up to 160 patients at 8 investigational sites.\nIn June 2018, we announced that Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare approved our Perceval sutureless aortic heart valve to treat aortic valve disease, which will enable us to provide patients and clinicians in Japan with a new option for aortic heart valve replacement. In January 2019, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare granted national reimbursement.\nIn June 2018, we announced FDA 510(k) clearance of the MEMO 4D semi-rigid mitral annuloplasty ring and confirmed the first implantation of the device. In October 2018, we received CE mark approval for Memo 4D. This next-generation of the MEMO device family offers several innovations, such as broader range of ring sizes, a new ring design and true semi-rigid stability and flexibility that allows us to reach a larger patient population with MR for treatment with the potential to improve patient outcomes.\nAdvanced Circulatory Support\nIn April 2018, we acquired TandemLife, which is focused on the delivery of leading-edge temporary life support products, including cardiopulmonary and respiratory support solutions. For further information, refer to Note 4. Business Combinations\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNeuromodulation Update\nOur NM business franchise designs, develops and markets NM therapy for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy, TRD and obstructive sleep apnea. We are also focused on the development and clinical testing of the VITARIA System for treating heart failure through vagus nerve stimulation.\nEpilepsy\nOur product development efforts are directed toward improving the VNS Therapy System and developing new products that provide additional features and functionality. We are conducting ongoing product development activities to enhance the VNS Therapy System pulse generator, lead and programming software, and we support studies for our product development efforts and to build clinical evidence for the VNS Therapy System.\nIn June 2017, the FDA approved our VNS Therapy device for use in patients who are at least four years of age and have partial onset seizures that are resistant to antiepileptic medications. VNS Therapy is the first and only FDA-approved device for drug-resistant epilepsy in this pediatric population. Previously, VNS Therapy was approved by the FDA for patients 12 years or older. In addition, in June 2017, we received FDA approval, and in August 2017, we received CE Mark approval, for our VNS Therapy device for expanded MRI labeling affirming VNS Therapy as the only epilepsy device approved by the FDA for MRI scans. Currently, SenTiva, AspireHC and AspireSR models of VNS Therapy technology provide for this expanded MRI access.\nIn October 2017, we obtained FDA approval and in April 2018, we received CE mark approval for our SenTiva VNS Therapy System, which consists of the SenTiva implantable generator and the next-generation VNS Therapy Programming System. SenTiva is the smallest and lightest responsive therapy for epilepsy. The new VNS Therapy Programming System features a wireless wand and new user interface on a small tablet. Together, these components offer patients with drug-resistant epilepsy a physician-directed, customizable therapy with smart technology that reduces the number of seizures, lessens the duration of seizures and enables a faster recovery.\nIn March 2018, we announced the launch and enrollment of the first patient in a clinical study to examine the use of our VNS Therapy System using Microburst technology. This feasibility study will determine the initial safety and effectiveness of delivering VNS Therapy using high frequency bursts of stimulation in patients who have drug-resistant epilepsy. The study consists of two cohorts, enrolling up to 40 patients at approximately 15 sites in the U.S. and Europe.\nIn August 2018, we announced a new cost analysis that found our VNS Therapy System results in lower resource utilization and lower cost for drug-resistant epilepsy patients when compared to continued treatment with anti-epileptic drugs. The analysis showed initial costs for the VNS Therapy device, including placement and programming, were estimated to be offset 1.7 years post-implant and equated to an estimated net cost savings of $77,480 per patient over five years. The net cost savings\nare due primarily to a reduction in seizure-related hospitalizations, resulting in a 21.5% decrease in costs compared to treatment with anti-epileptic drugs alone.\nDepression\nIn March 2017, the American Journal of Psychiatry published the results of the longest and largest naturalistic study on effective treatments for patients experiencing chronic and severe depression. The findings showed that the addition of VNS Therapy System to traditional treatment methods is effective in reducing symptoms in patients with TRD.\nIn January 2018, we announced the launch and enrollment of the first patient in our Global RESTORE-LIFE study, which evaluates the use of our VNS Therapy System in patients who have TRD and failed to achieve an adequate response to standard psychiatric management. We expect to enroll up to 500 patients at approximately 80 sites outside of the U.S. We are currently enrolling patients in Germany and will expand to other countries during the remainder of the year.\nIn July 2005, the FDA approved the VNS Therapy System for the adjunctive treatment of chronic or recurrent depression for patients 18 years or older who are experiencing a major depressive episode and have not had an adequate response to four or more antidepressant treatments. In May 2007, CMS issued a national determination of non-coverage within the U.S. with respect to reimbursement of the VNS Therapy System for patients with TRD, significantly limiting access to this therapeutic option for most patients. In May 2018, CMS published a tracking sheet to reconsider its National Coverage Determination ( NCD\u201d) of our VNS Therapy System for TRD in response to a letter that we submitted to CMS requesting a formal reconsideration of the NCD. We requested this review after a significant body of new evidence emerged about TRD and the role of VNS Therapy in its treatment. On February 15, 2019, we announced that CMS finalized its NCD to expand Medicare coverage for VNS Therapy for TRD. With the decision, CMS initiated coverage for Medicare beneficiaries through Coverage with Evidence Development when offered in a CMS-approved, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a follow-up duration of at least one year, with the possibility of extending the study to a prospective longitudinal study. We intend to commence a clinical study that meets these requirements. Enrollment will likely begin in the third quarter of 2019 and could take as long as 18 months to enroll approximately 500 patients.\nObstructive Sleep Apnea\nWe have invested in ImThera, a privately held, emerging-growth company developing an implantable neurostimulation device system for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, since 2011. On January 16, 2018, we acquired the remaining 86% outstanding equity interests in ImThera for up to approximately $225 million. Up-front costs were approximately $78 million with the balance paid on a schedule driven by regulatory and sales milestones. ImThera manufactures an implantable device that stimulates multiple tongue muscles via the hypoglossal nerve, which opens the airway while a patient is sleeping. ImThera has a commercial presence in the European market, and an FDA pivotal study is ongoing in the U.S.\nHeart Failure\nWe are focused on the development and clinical testing of the VITARIA System for treating heart failure through vagus nerve stimulation.\nWe received CE Mark approval of the VITARIA System in February 2015 for patients who have moderate to severe heart failure (New York Heart Association Class II/III) with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < 40%) and who remain symptomatic despite stable, optimal heart failure drug therapy. The VITARIA System provides a specific method of VNS called autonomic regulation therapy ( ART\u201d), and it includes the same elements as the VNS Therapy System. We conducted a pilot study, ANTHEM-HF, outside the U.S., which concluded in 2014. The study results support the safety and efficacy of ART delivered by the VITARIA System. During 2014, we also initiated a second pilot study, ANTHEM-HFPEF, to study ART in patients experiencing symptomatic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This pilot study is currently underway outside the U.S. The VITARIA System is not approved in the U.S.\nIn September 2018, we announced the first successful implantation of the VITARIA System in a patient enrolled in the ANTHEM-HFrEF pivotal study. ANTHEM-HFrEF is an international, multi-center, randomized trial to evaluate the VITARIA System for the treatment of advanced heart failure.\nCosta Rica Manufacturing Plant Closure\nIn October 2016, management initiated a plan to exit our Costa Rica manufacturing operations and transfer those activities to Houston, Texas. We recorded an impairment of the building and equipment of $5.7 million, which was included in restructuring expenses in our consolidated statement of income (loss). We completed the sale of the Costa Rica facility during the year ended December 31, 2017 and received $4.9 million in proceeds from the sale.\nDiscontinued Operations\nWe completed the sale of our CRM business franchise to MicroPort Cardiac Rhythm B.V. and MicroPort Scientific Corporation (the CRM Sale\u201d) on April 30, 2018 for total cash proceeds of $195.9 million, less cash transferred of $9.2 million, subject to a closing working capital adjustment. In conjunction with the CRM Sale, we entered into transition services agreements to provide certain support services generally for up to twelve months from the closing date of the sale. We previously concluded that the sale of CRM represents a strategic shift in our business that will have a major effect on future operations and financial results. Accordingly, the results of operations of the CRM business franchise are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and related assets and liabilities are presented as held for sale. For further information, refer to Note 5. Discontinued Operations\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCorporate Activities and New Ventures Update\nCorporate activities include shared services for finance, legal, human resources and information technology, corporate business development and New Ventures.\nMitral Valve Regurgitation\nMR occurs when the heart's mitral valve does not close tightly, which allows blood to flow backwards in the heart. This reduces the amount of blood that flows to the rest of the body, making the patient feel tired or out of breath. Treatment depends on the nature and the severity of MR. In certain cases, heart surgery may be needed to repair or replace the valve. Left untreated, severe MR can cause heart failure or heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias).\nOn May 2, 2017, we acquired the remaining 51% outstanding equity interests in Caisson, a clinical-stage medical device company focused on the design, development and clinical evaluation of a novel TMVR implant device with a fully transvenous delivery system for the treatment of MR for a purchase price of up to $72.0 million, in support of our strategic growth initiatives. As a result of our acquisition of Caisson, we began consolidating the results of Caisson as of May 2, 2017.\nIn April 2016, Caisson obtained FDA approval of an Investigational Device Exemption study using its technology for treating MR with TMVR and we are currently executing against a defined clinical data development plan designed to enable commercialization of the Caisson technology.\nIn August 2018, we announced the conclusion of our PRELUDE feasibility study of the TMVR system. The PRELUDE first-inhuman study evaluated the TMVR system to treat moderate to severe MR using a transseptal approach. This is a less invasive approach using a tube (catheter) through an incision in the groin, instead of an opening in the chest, to replace a patient's mitral valve. Following the positive patient outcomes from the PRELUDE study, we began enrolling patients in the INTERLUDE CE Mark trial.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we determined that a pause in enrollment of the INTERLUDE CE Mark trial would result in a delay in commercialization. This delay constituted a triggering event that required evaluation of the goodwill and IPR&D asset arising from the Caisson acquisition for impairment as of December 31, 2018. Based on the assessment performed, we determined that the goodwill and IPR&D asset were not impaired. A further delay or a change in management's estimates could result in a fair value that is below its carrying amount. We will continue to monitor any changes in circumstances for indicators of impairment.\nWe are also invested in two mitral valve startups, Cardiosolutions, Inc. ( Cardiosolutions\u201d) and Highlife S.A.S. ( Highlife\u201d). Cardiosolutions, a startup headquartered in the U.S. in which we have held an interest since 2012, is developing an innovative spacer technology for treating MR. Highlife, headquartered in France, is focused on developing devices for treating MR through percutaneous replacement of the native mitral valve. We recognized an impairment of our equity method investment in, and notes receivable from, Highlife during the year ended December 31, 2017, due to certain factors including a revision in our investment strategy that indicated that the carrying value of our aggregate investment might not be recoverable and that the decrease in value of our aggregate investment was other than temporary. We, therefore, estimated the fair value of our investment and notes receivable using the market approach and recorded an aggregate impairment of $13.0 million. For further information regarding Highlife, refer to Note 9. Investments\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCentral Sleep Apnea\nWe are invested in Respicardia Inc. ( Respicardia\u201d), a U.S.-based developer of implantable therapies designed to improve Respiratory Rhythm Management and cardiovascular health. Respicardia's remed\u0113 System is an implantable device system designed to restore a more natural breathing pattern during sleep in patients with central sleep apnea by transvenously\nstimulating the phrenic nerve. The remed\u0113 System received CE Mark certification in 2010 and in October 2017, Respicardia received U.S. FDA market approval. In September 2016, we elected not to exercise our option to purchase the outstanding shares of Respicardia as the investment no longer met our objective for substantial ongoing involvement taken into consideration with our overall portfolio management program. As a result, in September 2016, we recorded an impairment of $9.2 million equal to the amount of the carrying value of the option. In addition, we terminated our exclusive distribution agreement with Respicardia in November 2016. In December 2017, certain factors, including an additional round of external financing with a new investor, indicated that the carrying value of our investment might not be recoverable and the decrease in value of our investment was other than temporary. Our estimate of the fair value of our investment using the income approach was below our carrying value and as a result, we recorded an additional impairment of $5.5 million. This impairment was recorded in impairment of investments in our consolidated statement of income (loss).\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\n\nNet Sales by segments and geographic area:\nThe tables below present net sales by operating segment and geographic region (in thousands, except for percentages):\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with the sections entitled Business\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the matters set forth in Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 ( 2017\u201d) and December 31, 2016 ( 2016\u201d).\nDescription of the Business\nWe are a global medical device company focused on the development and delivery of important therapeutic solutions for the benefit of patients, healthcare professionals and healthcare systems throughout the world. Working closely with medical professionals in the fields of CV disease and NM, we design, develop, manufacture and sell innovative therapeutic solutions that are consistent with our mission to improve our patients' quality of life, increase the skills and capabilities of healthcare professionals and minimize healthcare costs. We are a public limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales, and headquartered in London, England.\nBackground\nWe were organized under the laws of England and Wales on February 20, 2015 for the purpose of facilitating the business combination of Cyberonics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Sorin S.p.A., a joint stock company organized under the laws of Italy. The business combination became effective in October 2015. LivaNova's ordinary shares are listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol LIVN.\u201d\nBusiness Franchises\nLivaNova is comprised of two principal business franchises, which are also our reportable segments: CV and NM, corresponding to our primary therapeutic areas. Other corporate activities include corporate shared service expenses for finance, legal, human resources, information technology and New Ventures.\nCardiovascular Update\nOur CV business franchise is engaged in the development, production and sale of cardiopulmonary products, heart valves and advanced circulatory support products. Cardiopulmonary products include oxygenators, heart-lung machines, autotransfusion systems, perfusion tubing systems, cannulae and other related accessories. Heart valves include mechanical heart valves, tissue heart valves and related repair products. Advanced circulatory support, which represents our recently acquired TandemLife business, includes temporary life support product kits that can include a combination of pumps, oxygenators, and cannulae.\nCardiopulmonary\nIn September 2017, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for the U.S. market launch of our Optiflow Arterial Cannulae Family. Optiflow aortic arch cannulae provide improved hydrodynamics with a novel dispersive tip design that improves blood flow characteristics resulting in reduced wall shear stress ( WSS\u201d) profiles. Optiflow Arterial cannulae feature a unique basket tip with large openings that allow a more physiologically compatible dispersive design. This design has been shown to significantly reduce WSS and turbulence, thereby improving hydrodynamics and potentially reducing ischemic complications from extracorporeal circulation during cardiac surgery.\nProduct Remediation\nFDA Warning Letter\nOn December 29, 2015, the FDA issued a Warning Letter alleging certain violations of FDA regulations applicable to medical device manufacturers at our Munich, Germany and Arvada, Colorado facilities and issued inspectional observations on FDA's Form-483 applicable to our Munich, Germany facility.\nThe Warning Letter further stated that our 3T devices and other devices we manufactured at our Munich facility are subject to refusal of admission into the U.S. until resolution of the issues set forth by the FDA in the Warning Letter. The FDA has informed us that the import alert is limited to the 3T devices, but that the agency reserves the right to expand the scope of the import alert if future circumstances warrant such action. The Warning Letter did not request that existing users cease using the 3T device, and manufacturing and shipment of all of our products other than the 3T device remain unaffected by the import limitation. To help clarify these issues for current customers, we issued an informational Customer Letter in January 2016 and that same month agreed with the FDA on a process for shipping 3T devices to existing U.S. users pursuant to a certificate of medical necessity program.\nFinally, the Warning Letter stated that premarket approval applications for Class III devices to which certain Quality System regulation deviations identified in the Warning Letter are reasonably related will not be approved until the violations have been corrected; however, this restriction applies only to the Munich and Arvada facilities, which do not manufacture or design devices subject to Class III premarket approval.\nWe continue to work diligently to remediate the FDA's inspectional observations for the Munich facility, as well as the additional issues identified in the Warning Letter. We take these matters seriously and intend to respond timely and fully to the FDA's requests. For further information refer to Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC\u201d) and FDA Safety Communications, Company Field Safety Notice Update and Product Remediation Plan\nOn October 13, 2016, the CDC and the FDA separately released safety notifications regarding the 3T devices. The CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report ( MMWR\u201d) and Health Advisory Notice ( HAN\u201d) reported that tests conducted by the CDC and its affiliates indicate that there appears to be genetic similarity between both patient and 3T device strains of the non-tuberculous mycobacterium bacteria M. chimaera isolated in hospitals in Iowa and Pennsylvania. Citing the geographic separation between the two hospitals referenced in the investigation, the report asserts that 3T devices manufactured prior to August 18, 2014 could have been contaminated during the manufacturing process. The CDC's HAN and FDA's Safety Communication, issued contemporaneously with the MMWR report, each assess certain risks associated with 3T devices and provide guidance for providers and patients. The CDC notification states that the decision to use the 3T device during a surgical operation is to be taken by the surgeon based on a risk approach and on patient need. Both the CDC's and FDA's communications confirm that 3T devices are critical medical devices and enable doctors to perform life-saving cardiac surgery procedures.\nAlso on October 13, 2016, concurrent with the CDC's HAN and FDA's Safety Communication, we issued a Field Safety Notice Update for U.S. users of 3T devices to proactively and voluntarily contact facilities to aid in implementation of the CDC and FDA recommendations. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated a program to provide existing 3T device users with a new loaner 3T device at no charge pending regulatory approval and implementation of additional risk mitigation strategies worldwide, including a vacuum canister and internal sealing upgrade program and a deep disinfection service. This loaner program began in the U.S. and is being made available progressively on a global basis, prioritizing and allocating devices to 3T device users based on pre-established criteria. We anticipate that this program will continue until we are able to address customer needs through a broader solution that includes implementation of the risk mitigation strategies described above. We are currently implementing the vacuum and sealing upgrade program in as many countries as possible until all devices are upgraded. On April 12, 2018, the FDA agreed to allow us to move forward with the deep cleaning service in the U.S. adding to the growing list of countries around the world in which we offer this service. On October 11, 2018, after review of information provided by us, the FDA concluded that we could commence the vacuum and sealing upgrade program in the U.S. Furthermore, we continue to offer a no-charge deep disinfection service (deep cleaning service) for 3T device users as we receive the required regulatory approvals.\nOn December 31, 2016, we recognized a liability for our product remediation plan related to our 3T device. We concluded that it was probable that a liability had been incurred upon management's approval of the plan and the commitments made by management to various regulatory authorities globally in November and December 2016, and furthermore, the cost associated with the plan was reasonably estimable. At December 31, 2018, the product remediation liability was $14.7 million. For further information, refer to Note 7. Product Remediation Liability\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSale of our Suzhou Industrial Park Facility in Shanghai, China\nIn March 2017, we committed to a plan to sell our Suzhou Industrial Park facility in Shanghai, China, an emerging market greenfield project for the local manufacture of Cardiopulmonary disposable products. As a result of this exit plan, we recorded an impairment of the building and equipment of $5.4 million and accrued $0.5 million of additional costs, primarily related to employee severance, during the year ended December 31, 2017, which are included in \u2018Restructuring expenses' in our consolidated statement of income (loss). In addition, the land, building and equipment were recorded as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet, with a carrying value of $13.6 million as of December 31, 2017. We completed the sale of the Suzhou facility in April 2018 and received cash proceeds from the sale of $13.3 million.\nHeart Valves\nIn January 2018, we announced that we had started enrollment in our BELIEVE study. This study focuses on the overall incidence of reduced leaflet motion identified by CT imaging in patients receiving our aortic heart valve. We are planning to enroll a minimum of 75 patients at 11 sites in the U.S. and Canada.\nIn March 2018, we announced that we had started enrollment in PERFECT, a Perceval valve clinical study in China. The study is being conducted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of Perceval in the Chinese population. We plan to enroll up to 160 patients at 8 investigational sites.\nIn June 2018, we announced that Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare approved our Perceval sutureless aortic heart valve to treat aortic valve disease, which will enable us to provide patients and clinicians in Japan with a new option for aortic heart valve replacement. In January 2019, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare granted national reimbursement.\nIn June 2018, we announced FDA 510(k) clearance of the MEMO 4D semi-rigid mitral annuloplasty ring and confirmed the first implantation of the device. In October 2018, we received CE mark approval for Memo 4D. This next-generation of the MEMO device family offers several innovations, such as broader range of ring sizes, a new ring design and true semi-rigid stability and flexibility that allows us to reach a larger patient population with MR for treatment with the potential to improve patient outcomes.\nAdvanced Circulatory Support\nIn April 2018, we acquired TandemLife, which is focused on the delivery of leading-edge temporary life support products, including cardiopulmonary and respiratory support solutions. For further information, refer to Note 4. Business Combinations\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNeuromodulation Update\nOur NM business franchise designs, develops and markets NM therapy for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy, TRD and obstructive sleep apnea. We are also focused on the development and clinical testing of the VITARIA System for treating heart failure through vagus nerve stimulation.\nEpilepsy\nOur product development efforts are directed toward improving the VNS Therapy System and developing new products that provide additional features and functionality. We are conducting ongoing product development activities to enhance the VNS Therapy System pulse generator, lead and programming software, and we support studies for our product development efforts and to build clinical evidence for the VNS Therapy System.\nIn June 2017, the FDA approved our VNS Therapy device for use in patients who are at least four years of age and have partial onset seizures that are resistant to antiepileptic medications. VNS Therapy is the first and only FDA-approved device for drug-resistant epilepsy in this pediatric population. Previously, VNS Therapy was approved by the FDA for patients 12 years or older. In addition, in June 2017, we received FDA approval, and in August 2017, we received CE Mark approval, for our VNS Therapy device for expanded MRI labeling affirming VNS Therapy as the only epilepsy device approved by the FDA for MRI scans. Currently, SenTiva, AspireHC and AspireSR models of VNS Therapy technology provide for this expanded MRI access.\nIn October 2017, we obtained FDA approval and in April 2018, we received CE mark approval for our SenTiva VNS Therapy System, which consists of the SenTiva implantable generator and the next-generation VNS Therapy Programming System. SenTiva is the smallest and lightest responsive therapy for epilepsy. The new VNS Therapy Programming System features a wireless wand and new user interface on a small tablet. Together, these components offer patients with drug-resistant epilepsy a physician-directed, customizable therapy with smart technology that reduces the number of seizures, lessens the duration of seizures and enables a faster recovery.\nIn March 2018, we announced the launch and enrollment of the first patient in a clinical study to examine the use of our VNS Therapy System using Microburst technology. This feasibility study will determine the initial safety and effectiveness of delivering VNS Therapy using high frequency bursts of stimulation in patients who have drug-resistant epilepsy. The study consists of two cohorts, enrolling up to 40 patients at approximately 15 sites in the U.S. and Europe.\nIn August 2018, we announced a new cost analysis that found our VNS Therapy System results in lower resource utilization and lower cost for drug-resistant epilepsy patients when compared to continued treatment with anti-epileptic drugs. The analysis showed initial costs for the VNS Therapy device, including placement and programming, were estimated to be offset 1.7 years post-implant and equated to an estimated net cost savings of $77,480 per patient over five years. The net cost savings\nare due primarily to a reduction in seizure-related hospitalizations, resulting in a 21.5% decrease in costs compared to treatment with anti-epileptic drugs alone.\nDepression\nIn March 2017, the American Journal of Psychiatry published the results of the longest and largest naturalistic study on effective treatments for patients experiencing chronic and severe depression. The findings showed that the addition of VNS Therapy System to traditional treatment methods is effective in reducing symptoms in patients with TRD.\nIn January 2018, we announced the launch and enrollment of the first patient in our Global RESTORE-LIFE study, which evaluates the use of our VNS Therapy System in patients who have TRD and failed to achieve an adequate response to standard psychiatric management. We expect to enroll up to 500 patients at approximately 80 sites outside of the U.S. We are currently enrolling patients in Germany and will expand to other countries during the remainder of the year.\nIn July 2005, the FDA approved the VNS Therapy System for the adjunctive treatment of chronic or recurrent depression for patients 18 years or older who are experiencing a major depressive episode and have not had an adequate response to four or more antidepressant treatments. In May 2007, CMS issued a national determination of non-coverage within the U.S. with respect to reimbursement of the VNS Therapy System for patients with TRD, significantly limiting access to this therapeutic option for most patients. In May 2018, CMS published a tracking sheet to reconsider its National Coverage Determination ( NCD\u201d) of our VNS Therapy System for TRD in response to a letter that we submitted to CMS requesting a formal reconsideration of the NCD. We requested this review after a significant body of new evidence emerged about TRD and the role of VNS Therapy in its treatment. On February 15, 2019, we announced that CMS finalized its NCD to expand Medicare coverage for VNS Therapy for TRD. With the decision, CMS initiated coverage for Medicare beneficiaries through Coverage with Evidence Development when offered in a CMS-approved, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a follow-up duration of at least one year, with the possibility of extending the study to a prospective longitudinal study. We intend to commence a clinical study that meets these requirements. Enrollment will likely begin in the third quarter of 2019 and could take as long as 18 months to enroll approximately 500 patients.\nObstructive Sleep Apnea\nWe have invested in ImThera, a privately held, emerging-growth company developing an implantable neurostimulation device system for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, since 2011. On January 16, 2018, we acquired the remaining 86% outstanding equity interests in ImThera for up to approximately $225 million. Up-front costs were approximately $78 million with the balance paid on a schedule driven by regulatory and sales milestones. ImThera manufactures an implantable device that stimulates multiple tongue muscles via the hypoglossal nerve, which opens the airway while a patient is sleeping. ImThera has a commercial presence in the European market, and an FDA pivotal study is ongoing in the U.S.\nHeart Failure\nWe are focused on the development and clinical testing of the VITARIA System for treating heart failure through vagus nerve stimulation.\nWe received CE Mark approval of the VITARIA System in February 2015 for patients who have moderate to severe heart failure (New York Heart Association Class II/III) with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < 40%) and who remain symptomatic despite stable, optimal heart failure drug therapy. The VITARIA System provides a specific method of VNS called autonomic regulation therapy ( ART\u201d), and it includes the same elements as the VNS Therapy System. We conducted a pilot study, ANTHEM-HF, outside the U.S., which concluded in 2014. The study results support the safety and efficacy of ART delivered by the VITARIA System. During 2014, we also initiated a second pilot study, ANTHEM-HFPEF, to study ART in patients experiencing symptomatic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This pilot study is currently underway outside the U.S. The VITARIA System is not approved in the U.S.\nIn September 2018, we announced the first successful implantation of the VITARIA System in a patient enrolled in the ANTHEM-HFrEF pivotal study. ANTHEM-HFrEF is an international, multi-center, randomized trial to evaluate the VITARIA System for the treatment of advanced heart failure.\nCosta Rica Manufacturing Plant Closure\nIn October 2016, management initiated a plan to exit our Costa Rica manufacturing operations and transfer those activities to Houston, Texas. We recorded an impairment of the building and equipment of $5.7 million, which was included in restructuring expenses in our consolidated statement of income (loss). We completed the sale of the Costa Rica facility during the year ended December 31, 2017 and received $4.9 million in proceeds from the sale.\nDiscontinued Operations\nWe completed the sale of our CRM business franchise to MicroPort Cardiac Rhythm B.V. and MicroPort Scientific Corporation (the CRM Sale\u201d) on April 30, 2018 for total cash proceeds of $195.9 million, less cash transferred of $9.2 million, subject to a closing working capital adjustment. In conjunction with the CRM Sale, we entered into transition services agreements to provide certain support services generally for up to twelve months from the closing date of the sale. We previously concluded that the sale of CRM represents a strategic shift in our business that will have a major effect on future operations and financial results. Accordingly, the results of operations of the CRM business franchise are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and related assets and liabilities are presented as held for sale. For further information, refer to Note 5. Discontinued Operations\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCorporate Activities and New Ventures Update\nCorporate activities include shared services for finance, legal, human resources and information technology, corporate business development and New Ventures.\nMitral Valve Regurgitation\nMR occurs when the heart's mitral valve does not close tightly, which allows blood to flow backwards in the heart. This reduces the amount of blood that flows to the rest of the body, making the patient feel tired or out of breath. Treatment depends on the nature and the severity of MR. In certain cases, heart surgery may be needed to repair or replace the valve. Left untreated, severe MR can cause heart failure or heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias).\nOn May 2, 2017, we acquired the remaining 51% outstanding equity interests in Caisson, a clinical-stage medical device company focused on the design, development and clinical evaluation of a novel TMVR implant device with a fully transvenous delivery system for the treatment of MR for a purchase price of up to $72.0 million, in support of our strategic growth initiatives. As a result of our acquisition of Caisson, we began consolidating the results of Caisson as of May 2, 2017.\nIn April 2016, Caisson obtained FDA approval of an Investigational Device Exemption study using its technology for treating MR with TMVR and we are currently executing against a defined clinical data development plan designed to enable commercialization of the Caisson technology.\nIn August 2018, we announced the conclusion of our PRELUDE feasibility study of the TMVR system. The PRELUDE first-inhuman study evaluated the TMVR system to treat moderate to severe MR using a transseptal approach. This is a less invasive approach using a tube (catheter) through an incision in the groin, instead of an opening in the chest, to replace a patient's mitral valve. Following the positive patient outcomes from the PRELUDE study, we began enrolling patients in the INTERLUDE CE Mark trial.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we determined that a pause in enrollment of the INTERLUDE CE Mark trial would result in a delay in commercialization. This delay constituted a triggering event that required evaluation of the goodwill and IPR&D asset arising from the Caisson acquisition for impairment as of December 31, 2018. Based on the assessment performed, we determined that the goodwill and IPR&D asset were not impaired. A further delay or a change in management's estimates could result in a fair value that is below its carrying amount. We will continue to monitor any changes in circumstances for indicators of impairment.\nWe are also invested in two mitral valve startups, Cardiosolutions, Inc. ( Cardiosolutions\u201d) and Highlife S.A.S. ( Highlife\u201d). Cardiosolutions, a startup headquartered in the U.S. in which we have held an interest since 2012, is developing an innovative spacer technology for treating MR. Highlife, headquartered in France, is focused on developing devices for treating MR through percutaneous replacement of the native mitral valve. We recognized an impairment of our equity method investment in, and notes receivable from, Highlife during the year ended December 31, 2017, due to certain factors including a revision in our investment strategy that indicated that the carrying value of our aggregate investment might not be recoverable and that the decrease in value of our aggregate investment was other than temporary. We, therefore, estimated the fair value of our investment and notes receivable using the market approach and recorded an aggregate impairment of $13.0 million. For further information regarding Highlife, refer to Note 9. Investments\u201d in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCentral Sleep Apnea\nWe are invested in Respicardia Inc. ( Respicardia\u201d), a U.S.-based developer of implantable therapies designed to improve Respiratory Rhythm Management and cardiovascular health. Respicardia's remed\u0113 System is an implantable device system designed to restore a more natural breathing pattern during sleep in patients with central sleep apnea by transvenously\nstimulating the phrenic nerve. The remed\u0113 System received CE Mark certification in 2010 and in October 2017, Respicardia received U.S. FDA market approval. In September 2016, we elected not to exercise our option to purchase the outstanding shares of Respicardia as the investment no longer met our objective for substantial ongoing involvement taken into consideration with our overall portfolio management program. As a result, in September 2016, we recorded an impairment of $9.2 million equal to the amount of the carrying value of the option. In addition, we terminated our exclusive distribution agreement with Respicardia in November 2016. In December 2017, certain factors, including an additional round of external financing with a new investor, indicated that the carrying value of our investment might not be recoverable and the decrease in value of our investment was other than temporary. Our estimate of the fair value of our investment using the income approach was below our carrying value and as a result, we recorded an additional impairment of $5.5 million. This impairment was recorded in impairment of investments in our consolidated statement of income (loss).\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results for the years
