In addition, the Company is the only U.S. dredging service provider with significant international operations. The Company operates in two reportable segments: dredging and environmental & remediation.\nDredging generally involves the enhancement or preservation of the navigability of waterways or the protection of shorelines through the removal or replenishment of soil, sand or rock. Domestically, our work generally is performed in coastal waterways and deep water ports. The U.S. dredging market consists of four primary types of work: capital, coastal protection, maintenance and rivers & lakes. Capital dredging consists primarily of port expansion projects, which involve the deepening of channels and berthing basins to allow access by larger, deeper draft ships and the provision of land fill used to expand port facilities. In addition to port work, capital projects also include coastal restoration and land reclamations, trench digging for pipelines, tunnels, and cables, and other dredging related to the construction of breakwaters, jetties, canals and other marine structures. Coastal protection projects involve moving sand from the ocean floor to shoreline locations where erosion threatens shoreline assets. Maintenance dredging consists of the re-dredging of previously deepened waterways and harbors to remove silt, sand and other accumulated sediments. Due to natural sedimentation, most channels generally require maintenance dredging every one to three years, thus creating a recurring source of dredging work that is typically non-deferrable if optimal navigability is to be maintained. In addition, severe weather such as hurricanes, flooding and droughts can also cause the accumulation of sediments and drive the need for maintenance dredging. Rivers & lakes dredging and related operations typically consist of lake and river dredging, inland levee and construction dredging, environmental restoration and habitat improvement and other marine construction projects.\nOn November 4, 2014, the Company acquired the stock of Magnus Pacific Corporation, a leading provider of environmental remediation, geotechnical construction, demolition, and sediments and wetlands construction, headquartered outside of Sacramento, California, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $40 million. Magnus Pacific ( Magnus\u201d) and Terra Contracting Services, LLC ( Terra\u201d) comprise the environmental & remediation segment of the Company and working with our dredging segment, have the capabilities and geographic reach to perform work throughout the United States on land and in water.\nThe Company's bid dredging market is defined as the aggregate dollar value of domestic dredging projects on which the Company bid or could have bid if not for capacity constraints or other considerations ( bid market\u201d). The Company experienced an average combined bid market share in the U.S. of 43% over the prior three years, including 46%, 50%, 28% and 60% of the domestic capital, coastal protection, maintenance and rivers & lakes sectors, respectively. The bid market for environmental & remediation work is highly fragmented and similar bid market statistics are not easily available.\nIn 2015, dredging revenues accounted for 79% of the Company's revenue. The Company's fleet of 30 dredges, of which seven are deployed internationally, 23 material transportation barges, two drillboats, and numerous other support vessels is the largest and most diverse fleet of any U.S. dredging company. For the dredging segment, the Company's fleet of dredging equipment can be utilized on one or many types of work and in various geographic locations. This flexible approach to the Company's fleet utilization, driven by the project scope and equipment, enables us to move equipment in response to changes in demand for dredging services to take advantage of the most attractive opportunities.\nThe Company's largest domestic dredging customer is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps\u201d), which has responsibility for federally funded projects related to navigation and flood control of U.S. waterways. Multi-jurisdictional cost sharing arrangements are allowing the Corps to utilize funds from sources other than the federal budget to prioritize additional projects where waterway infrastructure improvements can have an impact to large regions. Although some of a project's funding may ultimately be derived from multiple sources, the Corps maintains the authority over the project and is the Company's customer. In 2015, the Company's dredging revenues earned from contracts with federal government agencies, including the Corps as well as other federal entities such as the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Navy, were approximately 64% of dredging revenues, up slightly from the Company's prior three year average of 63%.\nIn 2015, environmental & remediation revenues accounted for 21% of total revenue. The Company's environmental & remediation segment provides soil, water and sediment environmental remediation for the state, local and private party markets. Remediation involves the retrieval and removal of contamination from an environment through the use of separation techniques or disposal based on the quantity and severity of the contamination. In addition, the environmental & remediation segment performs industrial cleaning, abatement services and hazardous waste removal. Our acquisition of Magnus Pacific Corporation expands the geographic footprint of our environmental operations to include the U.S. West Coast and broadens our suite of services to include geotechnical contracting capabilities and other environmental solutions.\nThe Company and a New Jersey aggregates company each own 50% of Amboy Aggregates ( Amboy\u201d). Amboy was formed in December 1984 to mine sand from the entrance channel to New York Harbor to provide sand and aggregate for use in road and\nbuilding construction and for clean land fill. Amboy sold its interest in a stone import business and its holdings in land during 2014 and is winding down operations.\nIn addition, the Company and a New Jersey aggregates company each own 50% of Lower Main Street Development, LLC ( Lower Main\u201d). Lower Main was organized in February 2003 to hold land for development or sale. This land owned in conjunction with Amboy was sold in 2014. Lower Main is winding down operations.\nThe Company and a European based remediation company each own 50% of TerraSea Environmental Solutions LLC ( TerraSea\u201d), a remediation business. TerraSea provides water and land based environmental services in the area of clean up and remediation of sediments, soil and groundwater for both marine and land based projects. The Company has commenced the wind down of TerraSea with its joint venture partner.\nOn April 24, 2014, the Company announced that it had completed the sale of NASDI, LLC and Yankee Environmental Services, LLC, which together comprised the Company's historical demolition business, to a privately owned demolition company for $5.3 million plus retention of certain assets and preclosing liabilities. The historical demolition business has been retrospectively presented as discontinued operations and is no longer reflected in continuing operations. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nContract Revenues\nMost of the Company's contracts are obtained through competitive bidding on terms specified by the party inviting the bid. The types of equipment required to perform the specified service, project site conditions, the estimated project duration, seasonality, location and complexity of a project affect the cost of performing the contract and the price that contractors will bid.\nThe Company recognizes contract revenues under the percentage-of-completion method based on the Company's engineering estimates of the physical percentage completed for dredging projects and based on costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs for environmental & remediation projects. For dredging projects, costs of contract revenues are adjusted to reflect the gross profit percentage expected to be achieved upon ultimate completion of each dredging project. For environmental & remediation projects, contract revenues are adjusted to reflect the estimated gross profit percentage. Provisions for estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Change orders are not recognized in revenue until the recovery is probable and collectability is reasonably assured. Claims for additional compensation due to the Company are not recognized in contract revenues until such claims are settled. Billings on contracts are generally submitted after verification with the customers of physical progress and may not match the timing of revenue recognition. The difference between amounts billed and recognized as revenue is reflected in the balance sheet as either contract revenues in excess of billings or billings in excess of contract revenues. Contract modifications may be negotiated when a change from the original contract specifications is encountered, necessitating a change in project scope or performance methodology and/or material disposal. Significant expenditures incurred incidental to major contracts are deferred and recognized as contract costs based on contract performance over the duration of the related project. These expenditures are reported as prepaid expenses.\nCosts and Expenses\nThe components of costs of contract revenues include labor, equipment (including depreciation, maintenance, insurance and long-term rentals), subcontracts, fuel, supplies, short-term rentals and project overhead. Hourly labor generally is hired on a project-by-project basis. Much of our domestic dredging hourly labor force is represented by labor unions with collective bargaining agreements that expire at various dates during 2016 through 2018, which historically have been extended without disruption. The environmental & remediation segment's hourly labor force is made up of union and non-union employees. Project costs, excluding labor, have averaged approximately 20% to 22% of total costs of contract revenues over the prior three years.\nDuring the year, both dredging equipment utilization and the timing of fixed cost expenditures fluctuate significantly. Accordingly, the Company allocates these fixed equipment costs to interim periods in proportion to dredging revenues recognized over the year to better match revenues and expenses. Specifically, at each interim reporting date the Company compares actual dredging revenues earned to date on the Company's dredging contracts to expected annual revenues and recognizes dredging equipment costs on the same proportionate basis. In the fourth quarter, any over or under allocated equipment costs are recognized such that the expense for the year equals actual equipment costs incurred during the year. As a result of this methodology, the recorded expense in any interim period may be higher or lower than the actual equipment costs incurred in that interim period.\nFor some environmental & remediation contracts, the Company has entered into unincorporated construction joint ventures under which certain portions of a larger project are performed. These investments are accounted for under the proportionate consolidation method for income statement reporting and under the equity method for balance sheet reporting. The Company's interests in any profits and assets and proportionate share in any losses and liabilities are recognized based on the Company's stated\npercentage partnership interest in the project. For projects related to proportionately consolidated joint ventures, we include only the Company's percentage ownership of each joint venture's backlog.\nPrimary Factors that Determine Operating Profitability\nDredging. The Company's results of operations for its dredging segment for a calendar or quarterly period are generally determined by the following three factors:\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Bid wins and dredge employment-The Company's dredging segment generates revenues when the Company wins a bid for a dredging contract and starts that project. Although the Company's dredging equipment is subject to downtime for scheduled periodic maintenance and repair, the Company seeks to maximize its revenues by employing its dredging equipment on a full-time basis, allowing for scheduled down time and mobilization. If a dredge is idle (i.e., the dredge is not employed on a dredging project or undergoing scheduled periodic maintenance and repair), the Company does not earn revenue with respect to that dredge during the time period for which it is idle.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Project and dredge mix -The Company's domestic dredging projects generally involve domestic capital, maintenance and coastal protection work and its foreign dredging projects generally involve capital work. In addition, the Company's dredging projects vary in duration and, in general, projects of longer duration result in less dredge downtime in a given period. Moreover, the Company's dredges have different physical capabilities and typically work on certain types of dredging projects. Accordingly, the Company's dredges have different daily revenue generating capacities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company generally expects to achieve different levels of gross profit margin (i.e., gross profit divided by revenues) for work performed on the different types of dredging projects and for work performed by different types of dredges. The Company's expected gross margin for a project is based upon the Company's estimates at the time of the bid. Although the Company seeks to bid on and win projects that will maximize its gross margin, the Company cannot control the type of dredging projects that are available for bid from time to time, the type of dredge that is needed to complete these projects, the competitive landscape at the time of bid or the time schedule upon which these projects are required to be completed. As a result, in some quarters the Company works on a mix of dredging projects that, in the aggregate, have relatively high expected gross margins (based on project type and dredges employed) and in other quarters, the Company works on a mix of dredging projects that, in the aggregate, have relatively low expected gross margins (based on project type and dredges employed).\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Project execution-The Company seeks to execute all of its dredging projects consistent with or at a higher production than its as-bid project estimates. In general, the Company's ability to achieve its project estimates depends upon many factors including soil conditions, weather, variances from estimated project conditions, equipment mobilization time periods, unplanned equipment downtime or other events or circumstances beyond the Company's control. If the Company experiences any of these events and circumstances, the completion of a dredging project will often be accelerated or delayed, as applicable, and, consequently, the Company will experience project results that are better or worse than its estimates. The Company does its best to estimate for events and circumstances that are not within its control; however, these situations are inherent in dredging.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEnvironmental & remediation. The Company's environmental & remediation segment generates revenues when the Company is awarded a contract and starts the project. The Company's revenues from its environmental & remediation segment increase or decrease based upon market demand. Like the Company's dredging segment, results of operations for the Company's environmental & remediation segment fluctuate based upon project mix and the Company's ability to execute its projects consistent with its estimates. Environmental & remediation margins are based upon the specified service, the estimated project duration, seasonality, location and complexity of a project.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements. The application of certain of these policies requires significant judgments or an estimation process that can affect the Company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows, as well as the related footnote disclosures. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable. If actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in the Company's results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. The following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the Company's reported financial results.\nPercentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition-The Company's contract revenues are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method, which is by its nature based on an estimation process. For dredging projects, the Company uses engineering estimates of the physical percentage of completion. For environmental & remediation projects, the Company uses estimates of costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs to determine the percentage of project completion. In preparing\nestimates, the Company draws on its extensive experience in the dredging and environmental & remediation businesses. In its dredging segment, the Company utilizes its database of historical dredging information and technical computations to ensure that its estimates are as accurate as possible, given current circumstances. Provisions for estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Change orders are not recognized in revenue until the recovery is probable and collectability is reasonably assured. Claims for additional compensation are not recognized in contract revenues until such claims are settled. Cost and profit estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis to reflect changes in expected project performance.\nImpairment of goodwill-Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company believes that this estimate is a critical accounting estimate because: (i) goodwill is a material asset and (ii) the impact of an impairment could be material to the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations. The Company performs its annual impairment test as of July 1 each year. The Company has three operating segments: dredging, Terra and Magnus, which were aggregated into two reportable segments: dredging and environmental & remediation. As Terra and Magnus have similarity in economic margins, services, production processes, customer types, distribution methods and regulatory environment, they were aggregated into one reporting segment. The Company has determined that the operating segments are the Company's three reporting units.\nThe Company assesses the fair values of its reporting units using both a market-based approach and an income-based approach. Under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of factors, including estimates of future market growth trends, forecasted revenues and expenses, appropriate discount rates and other variables. The estimates are based on assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable, but such assumptions are subject to unpredictability and uncertainty. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value, and may result in the impairment of goodwill in the event that actual results differ from those estimates.\nThe market approach measures the value of a reporting unit through comparison to comparable companies. Under the market approach, the Company uses the guideline public company method by applying estimated market-based enterprise value multiples to the reporting unit's estimated revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. The Company analyzes companies that performed similar services or are considered peers. Due to the fact that there are no public companies that are direct competitors, the Company weighs the results of this approach less than the income approach.\nIn the second quarter of 2015, due to a decline in the overall financial performance and declining cash flows of the Terra reporting unit, the Company concluded there was a triggering event that required an interim impairment test for the reporting unit and recorded an impairment charge of $2.8 million. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for the remaining reporting units in the third quarter and no additional impairment was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of the test date, the fair value of the remaining reporting units was substantially in excess of their carrying values. The Company will perform its next scheduled annual test of goodwill in the third quarter of 2016 should no triggering events occur which would require a test prior to the next annual test. At both December 31, 2015 and 2014, the dredging segment's goodwill was $76.6 million. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the environmental & remediation segment's goodwill was $7.0 million and $9.8 million, respectively.\nResults of Operations-Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nThe following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to common stockholders of Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, as

continuing operations\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, as provided herein, represents net income attributable to common stockholders of Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation, adjusted for net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, debt extinguishment and accelerated maintenance expense for new international deployments, goodwill or asset impairments and gains on bargain purchase acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is not a measure derived in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as an additional measure by which to evaluate the Company's operating trends. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is a measure frequently used to evaluate performance of companies with substantial leverage and that the Company's primary stakeholders (i.e., its stockholders, bondholders and banks) use Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to evaluate the Company's period to period performance. Additionally, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations provides a transparent measure of the Company's recurring operating performance and allows management to readily view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance. For this reason, the Company uses a measure based upon Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to assess performance for purposes of determining compensation under the Company's incentive plan. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with GAAP including: (a) operating income as an indicator of operating performance; or (b) cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. As such, the Company's use of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, instead of a GAAP measure, has limitations as an analytical tool, including the inability to determine profitability or liquidity due to the exclusion of accelerated maintenance expense for new international deployments, goodwill or asset impairments, gains on bargain purchase acquisitions, interest and income tax expense and the associated significant cash requirements and the exclusion of depreciation and amortization, which represent significant and unavoidable operating costs given the level of indebtedness and capital expenditures needed to maintain the Company's business. For these reasons, the Company uses operating income to measure the Company's operating performance and uses Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations only as a supplement. The following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to net income attributable to common stockholders of Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation:\nTable 114: <table> <tr>

million in 2015, an increase of $50.1 million, or 6.2%, from 2014 total revenue of $806.8 million. The increase was largely attributable to higher domestic capital dredging revenues and increases in rivers & lakes and environmental & remediation revenues. These increases were partially offset by declines in foreign capital, coastal protection and maintenance revenues. The Company categorizes revenue by service type to understand the market in which the Company operates and to assess how the Company is performing on bidding work or projects and is generating revenue from backlog.\nDomestic capital dredging revenues increased $11.5 million, or 5.9%, to $207.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014 revenues of $195.6 million. The increase in domestic capital dredging revenue was primarily attributable to work on the Savannah Harbor deepening project, a coastal restoration project in Louisiana and two LNG projects in Texas. These increases were partially offset by a greater portion of work performed on the PortMiami deepening project and on the Delaware River in the prior year. Deepening projects in New York and Maryland also contributed to revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. In 2015, the Company earned 100% of its backlog carried forward from December 31, 2014.\nRevenues from foreign dredging operations in 2015 totaled $139.9 million, a decrease of $15.1 million, or 9.7%, from 2014 revenues of $155.0 million. Foreign dredging revenue was driven by a project to widen and deepen the Suez Canal, a large project in Bahrain and four projects in Brazil. These six projects in our foreign operations comprise approximately 99% of the foreign dredging revenue earned. In comparison, 2014 revenue was driven the Wheatstone LNG project in Western Australia, two large projects in the Middle East and a greater amount of revenue earned on projects in Brazil. The Company earned 98% of its backlog carried forward from December 31, 2014.\nCoastal protection revenues were $184.1 million in 2015, a decrease of $10.1 million, or 5.2%, from $194.2 million in 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, coastal protection revenue included a large number of projects in New York and New Jersey for the repair of shorelines damaged as a result of Superstorm Sandy as well as projects in Florida and Virginia. The increase in work related to Superstorm Sandy was offset by revenue earned on large coastal protection projects in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia for the year ended December 31, 2014 which did not repeat during the current year. The Company earned 67% of its backlog carried forward from December 31, 2014.\nRevenues from maintenance dredging projects in 2015 were $120.1 million, a decrease of $3.8 million, or 3.1%, from $123.9 million in 2014. The Company's maintenance revenues in 2015 were driven by work performed on large projects in Georgia, Texas and Louisiana as well as significant harbor work in Florida and North Carolina. These increases in maintenance revenue were offset by a greater amount of revenue earned on projects in New York in the prior year as well as revenue earned on projects in Tennessee and Mississippi that did not repeat during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company earned 100% of its backlog from December 31, 2014.\nRivers & lakes revenues were $30.1 million for 2015, an increase of $1.2 million, or 4.2%, from $28.9 million in 2014. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was driven by work on a large lake project in Illinois as well as projects in Iowa and Florida. These project increases were partially offset by revenue earned on a private company project in Florida which did not repeat during the current year. The Company earned 30% of its backlog carried forward from December 31, 2014.\nThe environmental & remediation segment recorded revenues of $181.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, up 58.8% compared to $114.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is mostly attributable to revenue earned by Magnus which did not become part of the Company until the fourth quarter of 2014. Environmental & remediation revenue included work on a mine project in Washington as well as a geotechnical slurry wall construction project in California. This increase was partially offset by the completion of a remediation project in Michigan that had been part of the Company's environmental & remediation business in 2014, but did not continue during the current year. The Company earned 80% of its backlog carried forward from December 31, 2014.\nConsolidated gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $3.4 million, or 3.7%, to $95.9 million from $92.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gross profit margin (gross profit divided by revenue) for the full year 2015 was 11.2%, slightly below the prior year gross profit margin of 11.5%. The lower gross profit margin for 2015 was driven by uncontrollable circumstances that led to project delays on two of the environmental & remediation segment's largest projects during the year. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the environmental & remediation segment experienced losses and delays on several projects, with one project accounting for $6.9 million of the losses. A decline in the amount of work executed and increased operating overhead costs, including $6.5 million of increased labor and benefits costs due to the inclusion of Magnus for the full year, in the environmental & remediation segment also negatively impacted the gross profit margin as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decreases were mostly offset by strong contract margins in the dredging segment, particularly on our Suez Canal project and domestic coastal protection work, and higher absorption of fixed costs due to improved utilization of our fleet, leading to strong margins in our dredging segment.\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $71.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, up from $67.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The higher general and administrative expense for the full year 2015 is mostly attributable to increases in payroll and benefit expenses of $6.5 million, increased amortization expense of $5.0 million, primarily related to the Magnus acquisition and increases in state and local taxes of $0.6 million. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in the value of the Magnus seller note payable of $7.0 million as well as decreases in other office expenses of $0.8 million, legal and professional fees of $0.5 million and technical and consulting fees of $0.4 million.\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $23.0 million compared to $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition to the increase in gross profit offset by higher general and administrative expenses described above, the Company recorded a $2.8 million goodwill impairment charge at the Terra reporting unit which further added to the decline in operating income. The decrease in operating income was slightly offset by gains from sales of underutilized assets for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nEquity in loss of joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $6.1 million compared to equity in earnings of joint ventures of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company incurred a $3.9 million loss related to the TerraSea joint venture and a $2.3 million loss related to the wind down of the Amboy joint venture during 2015. In comparison, 2014 was driven by a $15.1 million gain on sale of real estate owned jointly by our Amboy and Lower Main joint ventures, partially offset by a $10.2 million loss related to the TerraSea joint venture.\nThe Company's net interest expense for 2015 totaled $24.4 million compared with $20.0 million in 2014. The increase is primarily due to interest expense associated with the additional senior notes issued in November 2014 and the senior secured term loan facility ( Term Loan Facility\u201d). These expenses were slightly offset by lower interest expense related to the Company's revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIncome tax benefit in 2015 was $2.5 million compared to $11.5 million in 2014. This $9.0 million change is attributable to a tax benefit related to liquidation of a domestic subsidiary which allowed the Company to claim a worthless stock deduction on its federal income tax return in the prior year. The Company utilized part of the benefit to offset income in 2014 and will carry forward the remainder as a net operating loss to offset future income. Accordingly, this benefit is characterized as a component of our continuing operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net loss from continuing operations was $6.2 million compared to net income from continuing operations of $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in net income from continuing operations was attributable to the decrease in operating income, the losses incurred at the Company's joint ventures and the income tax benefit in the prior year that did not repeat in the current year, as described above. Further, prior year income from continuing operations benefited from a $2.2 million noncash bargain purchase gain recognized during the year.\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (as defined and reconciled on page 40) was $83.0 million and $77.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase of $5.9 million, or 7.7%, is largely attributable to higher depreciation and amortization expenses, increased interest expense and a lower tax benefit during 2015. The Company recorded $64.6 million of depreciation and amortization expense that is included as a component of operating income, but is excluded for the\npurposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations. The depreciation and amortization expense recorded in 2014 was $50.1 million. These changes were slightly offset by the change in net loss from continuing operations, as described above.\nResults by segment\nDredging\nDredging revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $681.3 million a decrease of $16.4 million, or 2.4%, compared to $697.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was attributable to lower foreign capital, maintenance and coastal protection revenues as compared to the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by higher domestic capital revenues, which included work on the Savannah Harbor deepening project, a coastal restoration project in Louisiana, and two LNG projects in Texas, and an increase in rivers & lakes revenues. Dredging revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 also included a project to widen and deepen the Suez Canal, several projects in New York and New Jersey for the repair of shorelines damaged as a result of Superstorm Sandy, large maintenance projects in Georgia, Texas and Louisiana as well as significant harbor work in Florida and North Carolina. Dredging revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was driven by a greater portion of work performed on the PortMiami deepening project, the Wheatstone LNG project in Western Australia, large coastal protection projects in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia and a greater amount of maintenance revenue earned on projects in New York as compared to the current year.\nDredging segment gross profit in 2015 increased 23.7% to $111.7 million from $90.3 million in 2014, and dredging segment gross profit margin (dredging gross profit divided by dredging revenue) was 16.4% in 2015, an increase from 12.9% in 2014. The increase in dredging segment gross profit was driven by strong contract margins, particularly on our Suez Canal project and domestic coastal protection work, and higher absorption of fixed costs due to improved utilization of our fleet, leading to strong margins on projects in the dredging segment. In comparison, dredging segment gross profit in 2014 was driven by completion of the Wheatstone LNG dredging project in Australia, which finished with strong contract margin commensurate with such a large and complex energy project. The strong margins on the Wheatstone LNG project in the second half of 2014 offset the negative margin impacts from our idle Middle East fleet during the first half of 2014.\nDredging segment operating income for 2015 increased 54.1% to $64.1 million, from $41.6 million in 2014 as a result of the strong margins, particularly on our Suez Canal project and domestic coastal protection work, as described above. Further, dredging segment operating income benefited from gains from sales of underutilized assets during the current year as compared to a loss on the sales of assets in the prior year.\nEnvironmental & remediation\nThe environmental & remediation segment recorded revenues in 2015 of $181.7 million, a $67.3 million, or 58.8%, increase from $114.4 million in 2014. The increase is attributable to revenue earned by Magnus which did not become part of the Company until the fourth quarter of 2014. Environmental & remediation revenue included work on a mine project in Washington as well as a geotechnical slurry wall construction project in California. This increase was partially offset by the completion of a remediation project in Michigan that had been part of the Company's environmental & remediation business in 2014 that did not continue during the current year.\nThe environmental & remediation segment experienced negative gross profit of $15.8 million for year ended December 31, 2015, down $18.0 million from gross profit of $2.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, with a negative gross profit margin of 8.7% and gross profit margin of 1.9%, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the environmental & remediation segment experienced losses and delays on several projects, with one project accounting for $6.9 million of the losses. A decline in the amount of work executed and increased operating overhead costs, including $6.5 million of increased labor and benefits costs due to the inclusion of Magnus for the full year, also negatively impacted the gross profit margin as compared to the prior year.\nEnvironmental & remediation segment operating loss was $41.1 million for 2015, compared to $17.8 million in 2014. This operating loss was mostly attributable to the lower segment gross profit described above and additional amortization expense of $5.0 million, primarily related to the Magnus acquisition. These negative impacts on operating income were partially offset by a reduction in the value of the Magnus seller note payable of $7.0 million.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nTotal revenue was $806.8 million in 2014, an increase of $75.4 million, or 10.3%, from 2013 total revenue of $731.4 million. The increase was largely attributable to higher domestic capital dredging revenues, which included a port deepening project in Miami and an LNG project in Texas, and maintenance dredging revenues, which included a large maintenance project in New York. Increases in foreign capital dredging and environmental & remediation revenues, which are attributable to the acquisition of Magnus,\nalso contributed to the overall increase in 2014. These increases were partially offset by declines in coastal protection and river & lakes revenues. The Company categorizes revenue by service type to understand the market in which the Company operates and to assess how the Company is performing on bidding work or projects and is generating revenue from backlog.\nDomestic capital dredging revenues increased $41.8 million, or 27.2%, to $195.6 million in 2014 compared to 2013 revenues of $153.8 million. The increase in domestic capital dredging revenue was primarily attributable to the port deepening project in Miami and an LNG project in Texas. These increases were partially offset by two 2013 coastal restoration projects in Louisiana that did not repeat in the following year. Deepening projects in New York and on the Delaware River also contributed to increased revenues in 2014. In 2014, the Company earned 80% of its backlog carried forward from December 31, 2013.\nRevenues from foreign dredging operations in 2014 totaled $155.0 million, an increase of $16.6 million, or 12.0%, from 2013 revenues of $138.4 million. Foreign dredging revenue was driven by the Wheatstone LNG Project in Western Australia, three projects in the Middle East and a project in Brazil. These five projects in our foreign operations comprise approximately 91% of the foreign dredging revenue earned. In comparison, 2013 revenue was driven by a significant project in Qatar as well as the mobilization and commencement of dredging activities for the Wheatstone LNG Project. The Company earned 100% of its backlog carried forward from December 31, 2013.\nCoastal protection revenues were $194.2 million in 2014, a decrease of $34.7 million, or 15.2%, from $228.9 million in 2013. A large number of projects in New York and New Jersey for the repair of shorelines damaged as a result of Superstorm Sandy continued to add to revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014; however, the dollar value of these Superstorm Sandy projects was lower than the year ended December 31, 2013. In addition, the Company worked on large beach projects in South Carolina, North Carolina and Florida which contributed to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company earned approximately 90% of its backlog carried forward from December 31, 2013.\nRevenues from maintenance dredging projects in 2014 were $123.9 million, an increase of $33.1 million, or 36.4%, from $90.8 million in 2013. The Company's maintenance revenues in 2014 were driven by work performed on a large project in New York as well as significant harbor work in New York, Maryland and Georgia. In comparison, the Company worked on maintenance projects in Florida, Maryland, Georgia and Tennessee during the year ended December 31, 2013. The Company earned 100% of its backlog carried forward from December 31, 2013.\nRivers & lakes revenues were $28.9 million for 2014, a decrease of $1.8 million, or 5.9%, from $30.7 million in 2013. The decrease in rivers & lakes revenues was mostly attributable to work on a remediation project in the Midwest and a large municipal lake project in Texas in 2013 that did not repeat during 2014. Rivers & lakes revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was driven by a large lake project in Illinois, as well as river projects in Nebraska and Mississippi and a private company project in Florida. The Company earned nearly half of its backlog carried forward from December 31, 2013.\nThe environmental & remediation segment recorded revenues of $114.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, up 20.7% compared to $94.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is attributable to the acquisition of Magnus, which accounted for $15.3 million of revenue, during the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as a greater number of environmental & remediation projects for the year ended December 31, 2014, including large remediation projects in New Jersey and Michigan. Additionally, the environmental & remediation segment teamed with the dredging segment to work on a large lake project in Illinois during 2014. The Company earned approximately 75% of its backlog carried forward from December 31, 2013.\nConsolidated gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $7.8 million, or 7.8%, to $92.5 million from $100.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Gross profit margin (gross profit divided by revenue) for the full year 2014 was 11.5%, below the prior year gross profit margin of 13.7%. The lower gross profit margin for 2014 was attributable to lower gross profit at our environmental & remediation segment related to cost overruns on a project and higher plant expenses. Gross profit margin at the dredging segment remained flat year over year.\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $67.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, down slightly from $68.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Increases in payroll and benefit expenses of $2.1 million and technical and consulting fees of $0.9 million were offset by a reduction in the value of the Magnus contingent seller note payable of $1.1 million, a decrease in legal and professional fees of $1.6 million and the reversal of a bad debt provision, for which we received payment, of $1.0 million.\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $23.9 million compared to $51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. In addition to lower gross profit described above, the lower operating income as compared to 2013 is due to the $13.4 million in proceeds from a loss of use claim received during the 2013 second quarter and $5.8 million of gains from the sales of underutilized assets in 2013.\nEquity in earnings of joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2.9 million compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in equity in earnings of joint ventures in 2014 was driven by a $15.1 million gain on sale of real estate owned jointly by our Amboy and Lower Main joint ventures. During 2014, the Company incurred a $10.2 million loss related to the TerraSea joint venture, which partially offset the gain on sale of real estate. The loss at TerraSea is the result of the Company's share of losses on two projects which experienced site condition delays. Additionally, there were cost overruns resulting from start-up delays that prevented the job from being completed in one season, as originally estimated, forcing the joint venture to demobilize and remobilize the equipment. These additional costs caused the project estimate to forecast a loss for the entire project which was fully recognized during the current period under the percentage-of-completion method.\nThe Company's net interest expense for 2014 totaled $20.0 million compared with $21.9 million in 2013. The decrease is primarily due to lower interest expense associated with the Company's revolving credit facility during the current year.\nIncome tax expense in 2014 was a benefit of $11.5 million compared to a provision of $10.5 million in 2013. This $22.0 million change is attributable to a tax benefit related to liquidation of a domestic subsidiary which allowed the Company to claim a worthless stock deduction on its federal income tax return. The Company utilized part of the benefit to offset current year income and will carry forward the remainder as a net operating loss to offset future income. Accordingly, this benefit is characterized as a component of our continuing operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net income from continuing operations was $20.7 million compared to $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in net income from continuing operations was largely attributable to an income tax benefit in the current year and a $15.1 million gain on the sale of real estate, as described above. Additionally, current year income from continuing operations includes a $2.2 million noncash bargain purchase gain recognized in the second quarter. These increases were partially offset by lower operating income and losses at our TerraSea joint venture for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (as defined and reconciled on page 40) was $77.1 million and $98.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease of $21.8 million, or 22.0%, is largely attributable to $13.4 million in proceeds from a loss of use claim received during the 2013 second quarter and $5.8 million of gains from the sales of underutilized assets in 2013. In 2014, the Company recorded $50.1 million of depreciation and amortization expense that is included as a component of operating income, but is excluded for the purposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations. The depreciation and amortization expense recorded in 2013 was $46.6 million.\nResults by segment\nDredging\nDredging revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $697.7 million an increase of $55.1 million, or 8.6%, compared to $642.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was largely attributable to higher domestic capital revenues, which included the port deepening project in Miami and an LNG project in Texas, and maintenance revenues, which included a large maintenance project in New York. Increases in foreign capital revenues from an LNG project in Australia also contributed to the overall increase.\nDredging segment gross profit in 2014 increased 6.0% to $90.3 million from $85.2 million in 2013, and dredging segment gross profit margin (dredging gross profit divided by dredging revenue) was 12.9% in 2014, consistent with 2013. The increase in dredging segment gross profit was driven by a greater amount of work during 2014 as compared to the prior year which was slightly offset by higher plant expenses associated with two dredges which were in dry dock during 2014, in addition to higher operating overhead costs compared to the full year in 2013. Further, 2014 gross profit was driven by completion of the Wheatstone LNG dredging project in Australia, which finished with strong contract margin commensurate with such a large and complex energy project. The strong margins on the Wheatstone LNG project in the second half of 2014 offset the negative margin impacts from our idle Middle East fleet during the first half of 2014.\nDredging segment operating income for 2014 decreased 24.0% to $41.6 million, from $54.7 million in 2013 due to the receipt of $13.4 million in proceeds from the dredge New York loss of use claim and $5.8 million of gains from the sales of underutilized assets in 2013. These 2013 activities were slightly offset by the increase in segment gross profit described above.\nEnvironmental & remediation\nThe environmental & remediation segment recorded revenues in 2014 of $114.4 million, a $19.6 million, or 20.7%, increase from $94.8 million in 2013. The increase is attributable to the acquisition of Magnus, which accounted for $15.3 million of revenue, during the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as a greater number of environmental & remediation projects for the year ended December\n31, 2014, including large remediation projects in New Jersey and Michigan. Additionally, the environmental & remediation segment teamed with our dredging segment to work on a large lake project in Illinois during 2014.\nEnvironmental & remediation segment gross profit was $2.2 million for year ended December 31, 2014, down $12.9 million, or 85.4% from $15.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, with a gross profit margin of 1.9% and 15.9%, respectively. The gross profit margin was impacted by a $4.3 million cost overrun due to a change in site conditions on one brownfield redevelopment project. The Company is currently working with the client to receive additional payment for a portion or all of these overruns. Additionally, the environmental & remediation segment experienced higher plant expenses, driven by investments in our expanded fleet of equipment. These additional costs offset the environmental & remediation segment's increased profit margins from higher fixed cost coverage during the first nine months of 2014.\nEnvironmental & remediation segment operating loss was $17.8 million for 2014, compared to $3.3 million in 2013. This operating loss was driven by the lower segment gross profit described above.\nBidding Activity and Backlog\nThe following table sets forth, by segment and type of dredging work, the Company's backlog as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Backlog\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dredging:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital - U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 411,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 135,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 176,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital - foreign\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 131,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Coastal protection\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 118,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 211,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 143,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rivers & lakes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 90,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dredging Backlog\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 677,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 594,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 515,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Environmental & remediation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Backlog\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 751,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 669,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 543,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td> *\n</td> <td> December 31, 2014 environmental & remediation backlog includes backlog acquired by the Company on November 4, 2014 in connection with the Magnus acquisition.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's contract backlog represents its estimate of the revenues that will be realized under the portion of the contracts remaining to be performed. For dredging contracts these estimates are based primarily upon the time and costs required to mobilize the necessary assets to and from the project site, the amount and type of material to be dredged and the expected production capabilities of the equipment performing the work. For environmental & remediation contracts, these estimates are based on the time and remaining costs required to complete the project relative to total estimated project costs and project revenues agreed to with the customer. However, these estimates are necessarily subject to variances based upon actual circumstances. Because of these factors, as well as factors affecting the time required to complete each job, backlog is not always indicative of future revenues or profitability. Also, 53% of the Company's 2015 dredging backlog relates to federal government contracts, which can be canceled at any time without penalty to the government, subject to the Company's contractual right to recover the Company's actual committed costs and profit on work performed up to the date of cancellation. The Company's backlog may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based upon the type and size of the projects the Company is awarded from the bid market. A quarterly increase or decrease of the Company's backlog does not necessarily result in an improvement or a deterioration of the Company's business. The Company's backlog includes only those projects for which the Company has obtained a signed contract with the customer.\nApproximately 87% of the Company's backlog at December 31, 2015 is expected to be completed and converted to revenue in 2016.\nDredging\nThe 2015 domestic dredging bid market totaled $1,286.2 million, a 15.4% decrease from the 2014 domestic dredging bid market of $1,521.0 million. The 2015 bid market decrease from the prior year is primarily due to additional coastal protection projects let for bid in the second half of 2014 to repair damaged shorelines in New York and New Jersey. The domestic dredging bid market in 2015 included the Savannah Harbor deepening project, a deepening project on the Delaware River, a coastal protection project in New Jersey, an LNG project in Texas and two significant coastal restoration projects in Louisiana. In comparison, the 2014 bid market also included the third and final phase of the PortMiami project, a large lake project in Illinois, an LNG project in Texas and a large beach\nproject in the Gulf. The Company won 57% of the overall 2015 domestic bid market, above its 37% win rate of the overall 2014 domestic bid market and the Company's prior three-year average win rate of 43%. Variability in contract wins from period to period is not unusual. The Company believes trends in its win rate over the prior three year periods provide a historical background against which current year results can be compared.\nThe Company's December 31, 2015 contracted dredging backlog was $677.7 million. This represents an increase of $83.5 million, or 14.1%, over the Company's December 31, 2014 dredging backlog of $594.2 million. These amounts do not reflect approximately $82.8 million of domestic low bids pending formal award and additional phases ( options\u201d) pending on projects currently in backlog. At December 31, 2014, the amount of domestic low bids pending award was $113.5 million. Backlog at December 31, 2015 includes two coastal restoration projects in Louisiana totaling approximately $173 million which were awarded during 2015 as well as approximately $105 million for the Savannah Harbor deepening project, approximately $131 million for two domestic capital projects and approximately $73 million for a coastal protection project in New Jersey.\nThe Company won 94%, or $501.4 million, of the domestic capital dredging projects awarded in 2015, a significant increase from $149.6 million in the prior year. Significant new awards during the year include the Savannah Harbor deepening project and a deepening project on the Delaware River, along with a large LNG project in Texas and two coastal restoration projects in Louisiana, all of which will continue into 2016. Approximately $411.5 million, or 61%, of the Company's December 31, 2015 contracted dredging backlog consists of domestic capital dredging work. The Company expects about 60% of its domestic capital backlog at December 31, 2015 to be performed in 2016. Domestic capital dredging backlog at December 31, 2015 was $275.7 million higher than the prior year. Completion of the Panama Canal expansion is on track to be completed in 2016, which continues to put pressure on the ports on the East Coast to continue with their studies and plans to deepen and widen in anticipation of the post-Panamax vessels. Additionally, during October 2015, BP settled the final Deepwater Horizon oil spill claims for approximately $20 billion. This amount reflects the preliminary agreement which was reached in the second quarter of 2015 and includes $5.5 billion related to Clean Water Act penalties. Several state and local governments have already reached deals that resolve their claims in the disaster. Many of the Gulf States previously committed to spending a portion of the fines received to repair the natural resources impacted by the oil spill including on coastal restoration projects that include dredging. Although the bulk of the fines are to be paid over the next 15 to 18 years, the Company expects several coastal restoration projects envisioned by the States to come to fruition in the next couple of years providing a new source of domestic capital dredging projects on which the Company will bid.\nForeign capital dredging backlog decreased to $1.8 million at December 31, 2015 from $131.5 million at the end of 2014. The decrease in the Company's foreign backlog is due to the completion of the project to deepen and widen the Suez Canal during 2015 which was included in backlog at December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company won and completed three projects in Brazil. At December 31, 2015, the Company was low bidder on an approximately $200 million land reclamation project in Saudi Arabia. This project will keep much of the Company's Middle East-based fleet utilized through the first quarter of 2018. The world's need for port construction and reclaimed land continues to expand to support global energy consumption, seaborne trade, population growth and tourism all of which are expected to lead to nearly 400 viable dredging projects over the next six years. Besides the Middle East, the Company continues to pursue ancillary work in South America where we have positioned a clamshell dredge and operate as a reputable regional provider. The Company expects the additional opportunities globally to provide a continued source of future international dredging revenue.\nThe Company won 25%, or $67.4 million, of the coastal protection projects awarded in 2015. Coastal protection projects awarded during 2015 included projects on the New York and New Jersey coast as a result of Superstorm Sandy and a project in Florida. The Company has contracted dredging backlog related to coastal protection of $118.9 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $211.1 million at the end of 2014. The decrease in backlog at December 31, 2015 is due to revenue earned in 2015 on projects in backlog at December 31, 2014. Funding related to Northeastern U.S. beach replenishment continues to be released and the Company is anticipating these new dredging projects along the coast to extend through 2016. Federal and state government actions continue to support the repair and improvement of America's coastline through the completion of protective beaches and berms.\nThe Company won 37%, or $165.3 million, of the maintenance dredging projects awarded in 2015. The maintenance dredging bid market for the year ended December 31, 2015 was up compared to the prior year as the Company was awarded more projects in addition to several higher dollar value projects during the current year, including harbor projects in Maryland, Florida and Texas totaling approximately $86 million. The Company's contracted maintenance dredging backlog at December 31, 2015 of $78.0 million is $52.9 million higher than the backlog of $25.1 million at December 31, 2014. At the end of 2015, Congress passed its Omnibus Funding Agreement, which set the Army Corps of Engineers' budget in 2016 close to $6 billion, which is an increase of $0.5 million above the fiscal year 2015 enacted level and $1.3 billion above the President's budget request. The budget includes the Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) target of $1.2 billion, a 7% increase over the $1.1 billion approved last year by Congress.\nThe Company won 11%, or $4.2 million, of the rivers & lakes projects in the markets where the group operates. Rivers & lakes awards include a private company project in Florida awarded and completed during the current year and a federal government project in Mississippi which will continue into 2016. The Company has contracted dredging backlog related to rivers & lakes of $67.6 million\nat December 31, 2015 which is $23.1 million lower than the backlog at December 31, 2014. The decrease at December 31, 2015 is the result of the Company continuing to earn revenue on its large lake project in Illinois during 2015. The Corps' work plan for 2016 includes several upper Mississippi River projects to open channels that are often clogged by silt and sediment from upstream, in addition to planned levee repair along the Mississippi River. During December 2015, Winter Storm Goliath caused the flooding of rivers in Missouri and surrounding states, including the Mississippi River. Additional dredging work may arise on rivers in the region as a result of the winter storm.\nEnvironmental & remediation\nEnvironmental & remediation segment backlog was $73.3 million and $75.3 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $2.0 million year over year. The decrease was driven by revenue earned on projects in backlog at December 31, 2014 that was not replaced during the current year. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company was awarded and earned revenue on a large mine project in Washington which will continue into 2016. As part of the environmental & remediation segment's initiatives, the Company will focus on geographical expansion in the geotechnical services business. Additionally, the Company anticipates additional contracting opportunities arising from the transformation of the U.S. energy infrastructure, specifically related to the remediation requirements as mandated by the EPA's rule to the regulate the disposal of coal combustion residuals from electric utilities promulgated in June 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company's principal sources of liquidity are net cash flows provided by operating activities, borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility and proceeds from issuances of long term debt. See Note 8 in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company's principal uses of cash are to meet debt service requirements, finance capital expenditures, including the construction of a dual mode articulated tug/barge trailing suction hopper dredge ( ATB\u201d), provide working capital and other general corporate purposes.\nThe Company's net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled $29.1 million, $67.2 million and $86.3 million, respectively. Normal increases or decreases in the level of working capital relative to the level of operational activity impact cash flow from operating activities. The decrease during the year ended December 31, 2015 was driven by a decline in net income during the current year and additional accounts receivable for projects completed late in 2015. Further, the Company recorded a reduction in the fair value of the Magnus seller note payable of $7.0 million to zero, in addition to reductions in interest and other contingent consideration. In 2014, the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of lower adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and an increase in working capital as compared to the prior year. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and the recovery of investment in working capital on two significant projects.\nThe Company's net cash flows used in investing activities of continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled $73.1 million, $122.0 million and $46.1 million, respectively. Investing activities in all periods primarily relate to normal course upgrades and capital maintenance of the Company's dredging fleet. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company spent $34.5 million on the construction of the ATB. In comparison, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company spent $44.3 million and $17.1 million on construction of the ATB. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company received $1.3 million in proceeds from the sale of underutilized equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company acquired Magnus Pacific Corporation for which the Company paid $25 million at closing. In 2013, the Company received $6.7 million for the sale of two vessels during the year as well as $13.6 million when the Company drew upon a vendor performance obligation related to the ATB construction contract.\nThe Company's net cash flows provided by financing activities of continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled $15.9 million, $35.1 million and $22.5 million, respectively. The change in net cash flows provided by financing activities is primarily due to repayments of the term loan facility of $5.0 million, repayments of a long term note payable of $0.4 million and the purchase of treasury stock during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company had net borrowings on the revolver of $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In comparison, the Company entered into a new senior secured term loan facility for an aggregate principal amount of $47.4 million as well as issued an additional $25 million of its 7.375% senior notes in 2014. Further, the Company paid down borrowings on the senior revolving credit facility, slightly offsetting the increases in cash flows provided by financing activities noted above. Cash flows provided by financing activities during 2013 were primarily due to net borrowings of $35 million on the Company's revolving credit facility, slightly offset by payment of $10.5 million on a promissory note related to the Terra acquisition.\nCredit agreement\nOn June 4, 2012, the Company entered into a senior revolving credit agreement (as subsequently amended, the Credit Agreement\u201d) with certain financial institutions from time to time party thereto as lenders, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender and an Issuing Lender, Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent and PNC Bank, National Association, BMO Harris Bank N.A. and Fifth Third Bank, as Co-Documentation Agents. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $210 million, multicurrency borrowings up to a $50 million sublimit and swingline loans up to a $10 million sublimit. The Credit Agreement also includes an incremental loans feature that will allow the Company to increase the senior revolving credit facility by an aggregate principal amount of up to $15 million. This feature is subject to lenders providing incremental commitments for such increase, provided that no default or event of default exists, and the Company being in pro forma compliance with the existing financial covenants, both before and after giving effect to the increase, and subject to other standard conditions.\nOn September 15, 2014, the Company entered into the fifth amendment (the Fifth Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement which exercised a portion of the incremental loans feature of the Credit Agreement that allowed the Company to increase the aggregate revolving commitment. The Fifth Amendment further amended the Credit Agreement so that the Credit Agreement will remain secured and collateralized by perfected liens on certain of the Company's vessels and its domestic accounts receivable, subject to permitted liens and prior interests of other parties. In addition, Zurich American Insurance Company, the Company's surety provider, secured permitted second mortgages on the same vessels securing the obligations under the Credit Agreement.\nOn November 4, 2014, the Company entered into the sixth amendment ( Sixth Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement. The Sixth Amendment amends the Credit Agreement to permit the entrance into the Term Loan Facility (see below) and incurrence of liens securing the Term Loan Facility, subject to certain restrictions and conditions; permit voluntary prepayments of the Term Loan Facility so long as, after giving effect to any such voluntary prepayment, the Company's total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00 and its fixed charge coverage ratio is greater than or equal to 1.25 to 1.00; permit the acquisition of Magnus Pacific (See Note 16) without diminishing the amount currently available under the Credit Agreement for additional Permitted Acquisitions\u201d (as defined in the Credit Agreement);exclude the potential earnout obligation of the Company in connection with the acquisition of Magnus Pacific Corporation of up to $11.4 million from Indebtedness\u201d (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and the total leverage ratio under the Credit Agreement; and permit the issuance of up to an additional $50 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company's currently outstanding 7.375% senior notes due 2019.\nDepending on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), borrowings under the new revolving credit facility will bear interest at the option of the Company of either a LIBOR rate plus a margin of between 1.50% to 2.50% per annum or a base rate plus a margin of between 0.50% to 1.50% per annum.\nThe Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default (including non-payment of principal or interest on any material debt and breaches of covenants) as well as events of default relating to certain actions by the Company's surety bonding provider. The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a net leverage ratio less than or equal to 4.50 to 1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25 to 1.00.\nThe obligations of Great Lakes under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by each existing and subsequently acquired or formed material direct and indirect domestic subsidiary of the Company. During a year, the Company frequently borrows and repays amounts under its revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had $20.0 million of borrowings on the revolver and $81.9 million of letters of credit outstanding, resulting in $108.1 million of availability under the Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with its various financial covenants under its Credit Agreement.\nTerm loan facility\nOn November 4, 2014, the Company entered into a new senior secured term loan facility consisting of a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $50 million (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) pursuant to a Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement\u201d) by and among, the lenders party thereto from time to time and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the Company borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $47.4 million in 2014 and an additional $2.6 million in 2015. The proceeds from the Term Loan Facility will be used for the working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company, including to repay borrowings under the Credit Agreement made to finance the construction of the Company's ATB.\nThe Term Loan Facility has a term of five years. The borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.655% per annum. If an event of default occurs under the Loan Agreement, the interest rate will increase by 2.00% per annum during the continuance of such event of default.\nThe Term Loan Facility provides for monthly amortization payments, payable in arrears, commencing on December 4, 2014, at an annual amount of (i) approximately 10% of the principal amount of the Term Loan Facility during the first two years of the term, (ii) approximately 20% of the principal amount of the Term Loan Facility during the third and fourth years of the term, and (iii) approximately 25% of the principal amount of the Term Loan Facility during the final year of the term, with the remainder due on the maturity date of the facility. In addition, the Company has usual and customary mandatory prepayment provisions and may optionally prepay the Term Loan Facility in whole or in part at any time, subject to a minimum prepayment amount.\nThe Loan Agreement includes customary representations, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for financings of this type and includes the same financial covenants that are currently set forth in the Credit Agreement.\nSurety agreements\nPerformance and bid bonds are customarily required for dredging and marine construction projects, as well as some demolition projects. The Company has a bonding agreement (the Zurich Bonding Agreement\u201d) with Zurich American Insurance Company ( Zurich\u201d) under which the Company can obtain performance, bid and payment bonds. In April 2015, we entered into additional bonding agreements with ACE Holdings, Inc., Argonaut Insurance Company, Berkley Insurance Company, and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (collectively, the Additional Sureties\u201d). The bonding agreements with the Additional Sureties contain similar terms and conditions as the Zurich Bonding Agreement. The Company also has outstanding bonds with Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America. Bid bonds are generally obtained for a percentage of bid value and amounts outstanding typically range from $1 million to $10 million. At December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding performance bonds valued at approximately $1,066.0 million of which $41.1 million relates to projects accounted for in discontinued operations. The revenue value remaining in backlog related to the projects of continuing operations totaled approximately $622.8 million.\nIn connection with the sale of our historical demolition business, the Company was obligated to keep in place the surety bonds on pending demolition projects for the period required under the respective contract for a project.\nSenior notes\nIn January 2011, the Company issued $250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 7.375% senior notes due February 1, 2019. Approximately $180 million of the net proceeds from the original issuance of the senior notes was used to prepay all of the Company's 7.75% senior subordinated notes due December 2013, including prepayment premiums and accrued and unpaid interest. In November 2014, the Company issued an additional $25 million in aggregate principal amount of its 7.375% senior notes due February 1, 2019. The proceeds from this issuance were used to repay indebtedness incurred under our senior secured revolving credit facility in connection with the acquisition of Magnus Pacific Corporation, and for general corporate purposes. The indenture governing the senior notes, among other things, limits the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to (i) pay dividends, or make certain other restricted payments or investments; (ii) incur additional indebtedness and issue disqualified stock; (iii) create liens on its assets; (iv) transfer and sell assets; (v) merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of its assets; (vi) enter into certain transactions with affiliates; (vii) create restrictions on dividends or other payments by its restricted subsidiaries and (viii) create guarantees of indebtedness by restricted subsidiaries. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions that are described in the indenture governing the senior notes.\nThe future declaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion of the Company's board of directors and will depend on many factors, including general economic and business conditions, the Company's strategic plans, its financial results and condition and legal requirements, including restrictions and limitations contained in the Credit Agreement, bonding agreement and the indenture relating to its senior notes. Accordingly, the Company cannot make any assurances as to the size of any such dividend or that it will pay any such dividend in future quarters.\nThe impact of changes in functional currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar on non-U.S. dollar cash balances, primarily the Australian dollar and the Brazilian real, is reflected in the cumulative translation adjustment-net within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Cash held in non-U.S. dollar currencies primarily is used for project-related and other operating costs in those currencies reducing the Company's exposure to future realized exchange gains and losses.\nThe Company believes its cash and cash equivalents, its anticipated cash flows from operations and availability under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund the Company's operations, capital expenditures and the scheduled debt service requirements for the next twelve months. Beyond the next twelve months, the Company's ability to fund its working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, scheduled debt payments and dividends, if any, and to comply with all the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement and bonding agreement, depends on its future operating performance and cash flows, which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond the Company's control.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2015. Additional information related to these obligations can be found in Note 8 and Note 13 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Obligations coming due in year(s) ending:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2023 and\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Total (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> beyond\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equipment notes payable (2)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior notes (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 337.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 317.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unconditional purchase commitments (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long term bank debt (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 572.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 126.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 416.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Excluded from the above table are $0.2 million in liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which the period of settlement is not determinable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Represents principal and interest on nine capital equipment leases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> Includes cash interest payments calculated at stated fixed rate of 7.375%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td> (4)\n</td> <td> Represents the principal on the Term Loan Facility, vessel financing, one capital building lease and all corresponding interest payments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td> (5)\n</td> <td> Includes payments for vessels being built to Company specifications and other contract related commitments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td> (6)\n</td> <td> Represents the Credit Agreement.

The Company has granted liens on a substantial portion of its owned operating equipment as security for borrowings under its Credit Agreement and other indebtedness.\nThe Company finances certain key vessels, office space, and other equipment used in its operations with off-balance sheet operating lease arrangements with unrelated lessors, requiring annual rentals of $22.5 million in 2016 which will decline to $0.3 million over the next nine years subject to future lease arrangements. These off-balance sheet leases contain default provisions, which are triggered by an acceleration of debt maturity under the terms of the Company's Credit Agreement. Additionally, the leases typically contain provisions whereby the Company indemnifies the lessors for the tax treatment attributable to such leases based on the tax rules in place at lease inception. The tax indemnifications do not have a contractual dollar limit. To date, no lessors have asserted any claims against the Company under these tax indemnification provisions.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding performance bonds with a notional amount of $1,066.0 million of which $41.1 million relates to projects accounted for in discontinued operations. The revenue value remaining in backlog related to the projects of continuing operations totaled $622.8 million. In connection with the sale of our historical demolition business, the Company was obligated to keep in place the surety bonds on pending demolition projects for the period required under the respective contract for a project.\nCertain foreign projects performed by the Company have warranty periods, typically spanning no more than one to three years beyond project completion, whereby the Company retains responsibility to maintain the project site to certain specifications during the warranty period. Generally, any potential liability of the Company is mitigated by insurance, shared responsibilities with consortium partners, and/or recourse to owner-provided specifications.\nThe Company considers it unlikely that it would have to perform under any of the aforementioned contingent obligations, other than operating leases.\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "The report provides an overview of the company's operations, including its dredging and environmental & remediation segments.

</tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nThe Company is the largest provider of dredging services in the United States and a major provider of environmental and remediation services. In addition, the Company is the only U.S. dredging service provider with significant international operations. The Company operates in two reportable segments: dredging and environmental & remediation.\nDredging generally involves the enhancement or preservation of the navigability of waterways or the protection of shorelines through the removal or replenishment of soil, sand or rock. Domestically, our work generally is performed in coastal waterways and deep water ports. The U.S. dredging market consists of four primary types of work: capital, coastal protection, maintenance and rivers & lakes. Capital dredging consists primarily of port expansion projects, which involve the deepening of channels and berthing basins to allow access by larger, deeper draft ships and the provision of land fill used to expand port facilities. In addition to port work, capital projects also include coastal restoration and land reclamations, trench digging for pipelines, tunnels, and cables, and other dredging related to the construction of breakwaters, jetties, canals and other marine structures. Coastal protection projects involve moving sand from the ocean floor to shoreline locations where erosion threatens shoreline assets. Maintenance dredging consists of the re-dredging of previously deepened waterways and harbors to remove silt, sand and other accumulated sediments. Due to natural sedimentation, most channels generally require maintenance dredging every one to three years, thus creating a recurring source of dredging work that is typically non-deferrable if optimal navigability is to be maintained. In addition, severe weather such as hurricanes, flooding and droughts can also cause the accumulation of sediments and drive the need for maintenance dredging. Rivers & lakes dredging and related operations typically consist of lake and river dredging, inland levee and construction dredging, environmental restoration and habitat improvement and other marine construction projects.\nOn November 4, 2014, the Company acquired the stock of Magnus Pacific Corporation, a leading provider of environmental remediation, geotechnical construction, demolition, and sediments and wetlands construction, headquartered outside of Sacramento, California, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $40 million. Magnus Pacific ( Magnus\u201d) and Terra Contracting Services, LLC ( Terra\u201d) comprise the environmental & remediation segment of the Company and working with our dredging segment, have the capabilities and geographic reach to perform work throughout the United States on land and in water.\nThe Company's bid dredging market is defined as the aggregate dollar value of domestic dredging projects on which the Company bid or could have bid if not for capacity constraints or other considerations ( bid market\u201d). The Company experienced an average combined bid market share in the U.S. of 43% over the prior three years, including 46%, 50%, 28% and 60% of the domestic capital, coastal protection, maintenance and rivers & lakes sectors, respectively. The bid market for environmental & remediation work is highly fragmented and similar bid market statistics are not easily available.\nIn 2015, dredging revenues accounted for 79% of the Company's revenue. The Company's fleet of 30 dredges, of which seven are deployed internationally, 23 material transportation barges, two drillboats, and numerous other support vessels is the largest and most diverse fleet of any U.S. dredging company. For the dredging segment, the Company's fleet of dredging equipment can be utilized on one or many types of work and in various geographic locations. This flexible approach to the Company's fleet utilization, driven by the project scope and equipment, enables us to move equipment in response to changes in demand for dredging services to take advantage of the most attractive opportunities.\nThe Company's largest domestic dredging customer is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps\u201d), which has responsibility for federally funded projects related to navigation and flood control of U.S. waterways. Multi-jurisdictional cost sharing arrangements are allowing the Corps to utilize funds from sources other than the federal budget to prioritize additional projects where waterway infrastructure improvements can have an impact to large regions. Although some of a project's funding may ultimately be derived from multiple sources, the Corps maintains the authority over the project and is the Company's customer. In 2015, the Company's dredging revenues earned from contracts with federal government agencies, including the Corps as well as other federal entities such as the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Navy, were approximately 64% of dredging revenues, up slightly from the Company's prior three year average of 63%.\nIn 2015, environmental & remediation revenues accounted for 21% of total revenue. The Company's environmental & remediation segment provides soil, water and sediment environmental remediation for the state, local and private party markets. Remediation involves the retrieval and removal of contamination from an environment through the use of separation techniques or disposal based on the quantity and severity of the contamination. In addition, the environmental & remediation segment performs industrial cleaning, abatement services and hazardous waste removal. Our acquisition of Magnus Pacific Corporation expands the geographic footprint of our environmental operations to include the U.S. West Coast and broadens our suite of services to include geotechnical contracting capabilities and other environmental solutions.\nThe Company and a New Jersey aggregates company each own 50% of Amboy Aggregates ( Amboy\u201d). Amboy was formed in December 1984 to mine sand from the entrance channel to New York Harbor to provide sand and aggregate for use in road and\nbuilding construction and for clean land fill. Amboy sold its interest in a stone import business and its holdings in land during 2014 and is winding down operations.\nIn addition, the Company and a New Jersey aggregates company each own 50% of Lower Main Street Development, LLC ( Lower Main\u201d). Lower Main was organized in February 2003 to hold land for development or sale. This land owned in conjunction with Amboy was sold in 2014. Lower Main is winding down operations.\nThe Company and a European based remediation company each own 50% of TerraSea Environmental Solutions LLC ( TerraSea\u201d), a remediation business. TerraSea provides water and land based environmental services in the area of clean up and remediation of sediments, soil and groundwater for both marine and land based projects. The Company has commenced the wind down of TerraSea with its joint venture partner.\nOn April 24, 2014, the Company announced that it had completed the sale of NASDI, LLC and Yankee Environmental Services, LLC, which together comprised the Company's historical demolition business, to a privately owned demolition company for $5.3 million plus retention of certain assets and preclosing liabilities. The historical demolition business has been retrospectively presented as discontinued operations and is no longer reflected in continuing operations. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nContract Revenues\nMost of the Company's contracts are obtained through competitive bidding on terms specified by the party inviting the bid. The types of equipment required to perform the specified service, project site conditions, the estimated project duration, seasonality, location and complexity of a project affect the cost of performing the contract and the price that contractors will bid.\nThe Company recognizes contract revenues under the percentage-of-completion method based on the Company's engineering estimates of the physical percentage completed for dredging projects and based on costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs for environmental & remediation projects. For dredging projects, costs of contract revenues are adjusted to reflect the gross profit percentage expected to be achieved upon ultimate completion of each dredging project. For environmental & remediation projects, contract revenues are adjusted to reflect the estimated gross profit percentage. Provisions for estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Change orders are not recognized in revenue until the recovery is probable and collectability is reasonably assured. Claims for additional compensation due to the Company are not recognized in contract revenues until such claims are settled. Billings on contracts are generally submitted after verification with the customers of physical progress and may not match the timing of revenue recognition. The difference between amounts billed and recognized as revenue is reflected in the balance sheet as either contract revenues in excess of billings or billings in excess of contract revenues. Contract modifications may be negotiated when a change from the original contract specifications is encountered, necessitating a change in project scope or performance methodology and/or material disposal. Significant expenditures incurred incidental to major contracts are deferred and recognized as contract costs based on contract performance over the duration of the related project. These expenditures are reported as prepaid expenses.\nCosts and Expenses\nThe components of costs of contract revenues include labor, equipment (including depreciation, maintenance, insurance and long-term rentals), subcontracts, fuel, supplies, short-term rentals and project overhead. Hourly labor generally is hired on a project-by-project basis. Much of our domestic dredging hourly labor force is represented by labor unions with collective bargaining agreements that expire at various dates during 2016 through 2018, which historically have been extended without disruption. The environmental & remediation segment's hourly labor force is made up of union and non-union employees. Project costs, excluding labor, have averaged approximately 20% to 22% of total costs of contract revenues over the prior three years.\nDuring the year, both dredging equipment utilization and the timing of fixed cost expenditures fluctuate significantly. Accordingly, the Company allocates these fixed equipment costs to interim periods in proportion to dredging revenues recognized over the year to better match revenues and expenses. Specifically, at each interim reporting date the Company compares actual dredging revenues earned to date on the Company's dredging contracts to expected annual revenues and recognizes dredging equipment costs on the same proportionate basis. In the fourth quarter, any over or under allocated equipment costs are recognized such that the expense for the year equals actual equipment costs incurred during the year. As a result of this methodology, the recorded expense in any interim period may be higher or lower than the actual equipment costs incurred in that interim period.\nFor some environmental & remediation contracts, the Company has entered into unincorporated construction joint ventures under which certain portions of a larger project are performed. These investments are accounted for under the proportionate consolidation method for income statement reporting and under the equity method for balance sheet reporting. The Company's interests in any profits and assets and proportionate share in any losses and liabilities are recognized based on the Company's stated\npercentage partnership interest in the project. For projects related to proportionately consolidated joint ventures, we include only the Company's percentage ownership of each joint venture's backlog.\nPrimary Factors that Determine Operating Profitability\nDredging. The Company's results of operations for its dredging segment for a calendar or quarterly period are generally determined by the following three factors:\n \u00b7 Bid wins and dredge employment-The Company's dredging segment generates revenues when the Company wins a bid for a dredging contract and starts that project. Although the Company's dredging equipment is subject to downtime for scheduled periodic maintenance and repair, the Company seeks to maximize its revenues by employing its dredging equipment on a full-time basis, allowing for scheduled down time and mobilization. If a dredge is idle (i.e., the dredge is not employed on a dredging project or undergoing scheduled periodic maintenance and repair), the Company does not earn revenue with respect to that dredge during the time period for which it is idle. \n \u00b7 Project and dredge mix -The Company's domestic dredging projects generally involve domestic capital, maintenance and coastal protection work and its foreign dredging projects generally involve capital work. In addition, the Company's dredging projects vary in duration and, in general, projects of longer duration result in less dredge downtime in a given period. Moreover, the Company's dredges have different physical capabilities and typically work on certain types of dredging projects. Accordingly, the Company's dredges have different daily revenue generating capacities. \nThe Company generally expects to achieve different levels of gross profit margin (i.e., gross profit divided by revenues) for work performed on the different types of dredging projects and for work performed by different types of dredges. The Company's expected gross margin for a project is based upon the Company's estimates at the time of the bid. Although the Company seeks to bid on and win projects that will maximize its gross margin, the Company cannot control the type of dredging projects that are available for bid from time to time, the type of dredge that is needed to complete these projects, the competitive landscape at the time of bid or the time schedule upon which these projects are required to be completed. As a result, in some quarters the Company works on a mix of dredging projects that, in the aggregate, have relatively high expected gross margins (based on project type and dredges employed) and in other quarters, the Company works on a mix of dredging projects that, in the aggregate, have relatively low expected gross margins (based on project type and dredges employed).\n \u00b7 Project execution-The Company seeks to execute all of its dredging projects consistent with or at a higher production than its as-bid project estimates. In general, the Company's ability to achieve its project estimates depends upon many factors including soil conditions, weather, variances from estimated project conditions, equipment mobilization time periods, unplanned equipment downtime or other events or circumstances beyond the Company's control. If the Company experiences any of these events and circumstances, the completion of a dredging project will often be accelerated or delayed, as applicable, and, consequently, the Company will experience project results that are better or worse than its estimates. The Company does its best to estimate for events and circumstances that are not within its control; however, these situations are inherent in dredging. \nEnvironmental & remediation. The Company's environmental & remediation segment generates revenues when the Company is awarded a contract and starts the project. The Company's revenues from its environmental & remediation segment increase or decrease based upon market demand. Like the Company's dredging segment, results of operations for the Company's environmental & remediation segment fluctuate based upon project mix and the Company's ability to execute its projects consistent with its estimates. Environmental & remediation margins are based upon the specified service, the estimated project duration, seasonality, location and complexity of a project.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements. The application of certain of these policies requires significant judgments or an estimation process that can affect the Company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows, as well as the related footnote disclosures. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable. If actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in the Company's results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. The following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the Company's reported financial results.\nPercentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition-The Company's contract revenues are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method, which is by its nature based on an estimation process. For dredging projects, the Company uses engineering estimates of the physical percentage of completion. For environmental & remediation projects, the Company uses estimates of costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs to determine the percentage of project completion. In preparing\nestimates, the Company draws on its extensive experience in the dredging and environmental & remediation businesses. In its dredging segment, the Company utilizes its database of historical dredging information and technical computations to ensure that its estimates are as accurate as possible, given current circumstances. Provisions for estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Change orders are not recognized in revenue until the recovery is probable and collectability is reasonably assured. Claims for additional compensation are not recognized in contract revenues until such claims are settled. Cost and profit estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis to reflect changes in expected project performance.\nImpairment of goodwill-Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company believes that this estimate is a critical accounting estimate because: (i) goodwill is a material asset and (ii) the impact of an impairment could be material to the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations. The Company performs its annual impairment test as of July 1 each year. The Company has three operating segments: dredging, Terra and Magnus, which were aggregated into two reportable segments: dredging and environmental & remediation. As Terra and Magnus have similarity in economic margins, services, production processes, customer types, distribution methods and regulatory environment, they were aggregated into one reporting segment. The Company has determined that the operating segments are the Company's three reporting units.\nThe Company assesses the fair values of its reporting units using both a market-based approach and an income-based approach. Under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of factors, including estimates of future market growth trends, forecasted revenues and expenses, appropriate discount rates and other variables. The estimates are based on assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable, but such assumptions are subject to unpredictability and uncertainty. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value, and may result in the impairment of goodwill in the event that actual results differ from those estimates.\nThe market approach measures the value of a reporting unit through comparison to comparable companies. Under the market approach, the Company uses the guideline public company method by applying estimated market-based enterprise value multiples to the reporting unit's estimated revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. The Company analyzes companies that performed similar services or are considered peers. Due to the fact that there are no public companies that are direct competitors, the Company weighs the results of this approach less than the income approach.\nIn the second quarter of 2015, due to a decline in the overall financial performance and declining cash flows of the Terra reporting unit, the Company concluded there was a triggering event that required an interim impairment test for the reporting unit and recorded an impairment charge of $2.8 million. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for the remaining reporting units in the third quarter and no additional impairment was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of the test date, the fair value of the remaining reporting units was substantially in excess of their carrying values. The Company will perform its next scheduled annual test of goodwill in the third quarter of 2016 should no triggering events occur which would require a test prior to the next annual test. At both December 31, 2015 and 2014, the dredging segment's goodwill was $76.6 million. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the environmental & remediation segment's goodwill was $7.0 million and $9.8 million, respectively.\nResults of Operations-Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nThe following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to common stockholders of Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, as defined below, as a percentage of contract revenues for the years ended December 31:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, as provided herein, represents net income attributable to common stockholders of Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation, adjusted for net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, debt extinguishment and accelerated maintenance expense for new international deployments, goodwill or asset impairments and gains on bargain purchase acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is not a measure derived in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as an additional measure by which to evaluate the Company's operating trends. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is a measure frequently used to evaluate performance of companies with substantial leverage and that the Company's primary stakeholders (i.e., its stockholders, bondholders and banks) use Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to evaluate the Company's period to period performance. Additionally, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations provides a transparent measure of the Company's recurring operating performance and allows management to readily view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance. For this reason, the Company uses a measure based upon Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to assess performance for purposes of determining compensation under the Company's incentive plan. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with GAAP including: (a) operating income as an indicator of operating performance; or (b) cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. As such, the Company's use of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, instead of a GAAP measure, has limitations as an analytical tool, including the inability to determine profitability or liquidity due to the exclusion of accelerated maintenance expense for new international deployments, goodwill or asset impairments, gains on bargain purchase acquisitions, interest and income tax expense and the associated significant cash requirements and the exclusion of depreciation and amortization, which represent significant and unavoidable operating costs given the level of indebtedness and capital expenditures needed to maintain the Company's business. For these reasons, the Company uses operating income to measure the Company's operating performance and uses Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations only as a supplement. The following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to net income attributable to common stockholders of Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation:\n\nComponents of Contract Revenues\nThe following table sets forth, by segment and type of work, the Company's contract revenues for the years ended December 31, (in thousands):\n\n * Environmental & remediation revenue in 2014 includes Magnus which did not operate as part of the Company prior to November 4, 2014. \nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nTotal revenue was $856.9 million in 2015, an increase of $50.1 million, or 6.2%, from 2014 total revenue of $806.8 million. The increase was largely attributable to higher domestic capital dredging revenues and increases in rivers & lakes and environmental & remediation revenues. These increases were partially offset by declines in foreign capital, coastal protection and maintenance revenues. The Company categorizes revenue by service type to understand the market in which the Company operates and to assess how the Company is performing on bidding work or projects and is generating revenue from backlog.\nDomestic capital dredging revenues increased $11.5 million, or 5.9%, to $207.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014 revenues of $195.6 million. The increase in domestic capital dredging revenue was primarily attributable to work on the Savannah Harbor deepening project, a coastal restoration project in Louisiana and two LNG projects in Texas. These increases were partially offset by a greater portion of work performed on the PortMiami deepening project and on the Delaware River in the prior year. Deepening projects in New York and Maryland also contributed to revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. In 2015, the Company earned 100% of its backlog carried forward from December 31, 2014.\nRevenues from foreign dredging operations in 2015 totaled $139.9 million, a decrease of $15.1 million, or 9.7%, from 2014 revenues of $155.0 million. Foreign dredging revenue was driven by a project to widen and deepen the Suez Canal, a large project in Bahrain and four projects in Brazil. These six projects in our foreign operations comprise approximately 99% of the foreign dredging revenue earned.

In addition, the Company is the only U.S. dredging service provider with significant international operations. The Company operates in two reportable segments: dredging and environmental & remediation.\nDredging generally involves the enhancement or preservation of the navigability of waterways or the protection of shorelines through the removal or replenishment of soil, sand or rock. Domestically, our work generally is performed in coastal waterways and deep water ports. The U.S. dredging market consists of four primary types of work: capital, coastal protection, maintenance and rivers & lakes. Capital dredging consists primarily of port expansion projects, which involve the deepening of channels and berthing basins to allow access by larger, deeper draft ships and the provision of land fill used to expand port facilities. In addition to port work, capital projects also include coastal restoration and land reclamations, trench digging for pipelines, tunnels, and cables, and other dredging related to the construction of breakwaters, jetties, canals and other marine structures. Coastal protection projects involve moving sand from the ocean floor to shoreline locations where erosion threatens shoreline assets. Maintenance dredging consists of the re-dredging of previously deepened waterways and harbors to remove silt, sand and other accumulated sediments. Due to natural sedimentation, most channels generally require maintenance dredging every one to three years, thus creating a recurring source of dredging work that is typically non-deferrable if optimal navigability is to be maintained. In addition, severe weather such as hurricanes, flooding and droughts can also cause the accumulation of sediments and drive the need for maintenance dredging. Rivers & lakes dredging and related operations typically consist of lake and river dredging, inland levee and construction dredging, environmental restoration and habitat improvement and other marine construction projects.\nOn November 4, 2014, the Company acquired the stock of Magnus Pacific Corporation, a leading provider of environmental remediation, geotechnical construction, demolition, and sediments and wetlands construction, headquartered outside of Sacramento, California, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $40 million. Magnus Pacific ( Magnus\u201d) and Terra Contracting Services, LLC ( Terra\u201d) comprise the environmental & remediation segment of the Company and working with our dredging segment, have the capabilities and geographic reach to perform work throughout the United States on land and in water.\nThe Company's bid dredging market is defined as the aggregate dollar value of domestic dredging projects on which the Company bid or could have bid if not for capacity constraints or other considerations ( bid market\u201d). The Company experienced an average combined bid market share in the U.S. of 43% over the prior three years, including 46%, 50%, 28% and 60% of the domestic capital, coastal protection, maintenance and rivers & lakes sectors, respectively. The bid market for environmental & remediation work is highly fragmented and similar bid market statistics are not easily available.\nIn 2015, dredging revenues accounted for 79% of the Company's revenue. The Company's fleet of 30 dredges, of which seven are deployed internationally, 23 material transportation barges, two drillboats, and numerous other support vessels is the largest and most diverse fleet of any U.S. dredging company. For the dredging segment, the Company's fleet of dredging equipment can be utilized on one or many types of work and in various geographic locations. This flexible approach to the Company's fleet utilization, driven by the project scope and equipment, enables us to move equipment in response to changes in demand for dredging services to take advantage of the most attractive opportunities.\nThe Company's largest domestic dredging customer is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps\u201d), which has responsibility for federally funded projects related to navigation and flood control of U.S. waterways. Multi-jurisdictional cost sharing arrangements are allowing the Corps to utilize funds from sources other than the federal budget to prioritize additional projects where waterway infrastructure improvements can have an impact to large regions. Although some of a project's funding may ultimately be derived from multiple sources, the Corps maintains the authority over the project and is the Company's customer. In 2015, the Company's dredging revenues earned from contracts with federal government agencies, including the Corps as well as other federal entities such as the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Navy, were approximately 64% of dredging revenues, up slightly from the Company's prior three year average of 63%.\nIn 2015, environmental & remediation revenues accounted for 21% of total revenue. The Company's environmental & remediation segment provides soil, water and sediment environmental remediation for the state, local and private party markets. Remediation involves the retrieval and removal of contamination from an environment through the use of separation techniques or disposal based on the quantity and severity of the contamination. In addition, the environmental & remediation segment performs industrial cleaning, abatement services and hazardous waste removal. Our acquisition of Magnus Pacific Corporation expands the geographic footprint of our environmental operations to include the U.S. West Coast and broadens our suite of services to include geotechnical contracting capabilities and other environmental solutions.\nThe Company and a New Jersey aggregates company each own 50% of Amboy Aggregates ( Amboy\u201d). Amboy was formed in December 1984 to mine sand from the entrance channel to New York Harbor to provide sand and aggregate for use in road and\nbuilding construction and for clean land fill. Amboy sold its interest in a stone import business and its holdings in land during 2014 and is winding down operations.\nIn addition, the Company and a New Jersey aggregates company each own 50% of Lower Main Street Development, LLC ( Lower Main\u201d). Lower Main was organized in February 2003 to hold land for development or sale. This land owned in conjunction with Amboy was sold in 2014. Lower Main is winding down operations.\nThe Company and a European based remediation company each own 50% of TerraSea Environmental Solutions LLC ( TerraSea\u201d), a remediation business. TerraSea provides water and land based environmental services in the area of clean up and remediation of sediments, soil and groundwater for both marine and land based projects. The Company has commenced the wind down of TerraSea with its joint venture partner.\nOn April 24, 2014, the Company announced that it had completed the sale of NASDI, LLC and Yankee Environmental Services, LLC, which together comprised the Company's historical demolition business, to a privately owned demolition company for $5.3 million plus retention of certain assets and preclosing liabilities. The historical demolition business has been retrospectively presented as discontinued operations and is no longer reflected in continuing operations. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nContract Revenues\nMost of the Company's contracts are obtained through competitive bidding on terms specified by the party inviting the bid. The types of equipment required to perform the specified service, project site conditions, the estimated project duration, seasonality, location and complexity of a project affect the cost of performing the contract and the price that contractors will bid.\nThe Company recognizes contract revenues under the percentage-of-completion method based on the Company's engineering estimates of the physical percentage completed for dredging projects and based on costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs for environmental & remediation projects. For dredging projects, costs of contract revenues are adjusted to reflect the gross profit percentage expected to be achieved upon ultimate completion of each dredging project. For environmental & remediation projects, contract revenues are adjusted to reflect the estimated gross profit percentage. Provisions for estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Change orders are not recognized in revenue until the recovery is probable and collectability is reasonably assured. Claims for additional compensation due to the Company are not recognized in contract revenues until such claims are settled. Billings on contracts are generally submitted after verification with the customers of physical progress and may not match the timing of revenue recognition. The difference between amounts billed and recognized as revenue is reflected in the balance sheet as either contract revenues in excess of billings or billings in excess of contract revenues. Contract modifications may be negotiated when a change from the original contract specifications is encountered, necessitating a change in project scope or performance methodology and/or material disposal. Significant expenditures incurred incidental to major contracts are deferred and recognized as contract costs based on contract performance over the duration of the related project. These expenditures are reported as prepaid expenses.\nCosts and Expenses\nThe components of costs of contract revenues include labor, equipment (including depreciation, maintenance, insurance and long-term rentals), subcontracts, fuel, supplies, short-term rentals and project overhead. Hourly labor generally is hired on a project-by-project basis.

continuing operations\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, as provided herein, represents net income attributable to common stockholders of Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation, adjusted for net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, debt extinguishment and accelerated maintenance expense for new international deployments, goodwill or asset impairments and gains on bargain purchase acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is not a measure derived in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as an additional measure by which to evaluate the Company's operating trends. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is a measure frequently used to evaluate performance of companies with substantial leverage and that the Company's primary stakeholders (i.e., its stockholders, bondholders and banks) use Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to evaluate the Company's period to period performance. Additionally, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations provides a transparent measure of the Company's recurring operating performance and allows management to readily view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance. For this reason, the Company uses a measure based upon Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to assess performance for purposes of determining compensation under the Company's incentive plan. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with GAAP including: (a) operating income as an indicator of operating performance; or (b) cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. As such, the Company's use of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, instead of a GAAP measure, has limitations as an analytical tool, including the inability to determine profitability or liquidity due to the exclusion of accelerated maintenance expense for new international deployments, goodwill or asset impairments, gains on bargain purchase acquisitions, interest and income tax expense and the associated significant cash requirements and the exclusion of depreciation and amortization, which represent significant and unavoidable operating costs given the level of indebtedness and capital expenditures needed to maintain the Company's business. For these reasons, the Company uses operating income to measure the Company's operating performance and uses Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations only as a supplement. The following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to net income attributable to common stockholders of Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation:\nTable 114: <table> <tr>

the Company prior to November 4, 2014. \nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nTotal revenue was $856.9 million in 2015, an increase of $50.1 million, or 6.2%, from 2014 total revenue of $806.8 million. The increase was largely attributable to higher domestic capital dredging revenues and increases in rivers & lakes and environmental & remediation revenues. These increases were partially offset by declines in foreign capital, coastal protection and maintenance revenues. The Company categorizes revenue by service type to understand the market in which the Company operates and to assess how the Company is performing on bidding work or projects and is generating revenue from backlog.\nDomestic capital dredging revenues increased $11.5 million, or 5.9%, to $207.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014 revenues of $195.6 million. The increase in domestic capital dredging revenue was primarily attributable to work on the Savannah Harbor deepening project, a coastal restoration project in Louisiana and two LNG projects in Texas. These increases were partially offset by a greater portion of work performed on the PortMiami deepening project and on the Delaware River in the prior year. Deepening projects in New York and Maryland also contributed to revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. In 2015, the Company earned 100% of its backlog carried forward from December 31, 2014.\nRevenues from foreign dredging operations in 2015 totaled $139.9 million, a decrease of $15.1 million, or 9.7%, from 2014 revenues of $155.0 million. Foreign dredging revenue was driven by a project to widen and deepen the Suez Canal, a large project in Bahrain and four projects in Brazil. These six projects in our foreign operations comprise approximately 99% of the foreign dredging revenue earned. In comparison,"}
