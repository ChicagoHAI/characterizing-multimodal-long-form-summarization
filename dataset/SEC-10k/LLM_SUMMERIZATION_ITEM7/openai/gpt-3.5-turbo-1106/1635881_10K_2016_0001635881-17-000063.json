Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements, the notes thereto, and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. See Part I ( Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d) and Part I, Item 1A ( Risk Factors\u201d) in this report.\nOverview\nWe are a market leader in the provision of compression, production and processing products and services that support the production and transportation of oil and natural gas throughout the world. We provide these products and services to a global customer base consisting of companies engaged in all aspects of the oil and natural gas industry, including large integrated oil and natural gas companies, national oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas producers and oil and natural gas processors, gatherers and pipeline operators. We operate in four primary business lines: contract operations, aftermarket services, oil and gas product sales and Belleli EPC product sales. In our contract operations business line, we have operations outside of the United States of America ( U.S.\u201d) where we own and operate natural gas compression equipment and crude oil and natural gas production and processing equipment on behalf of our customers. In our aftermarket services business line, we primarily have operations outside of the U.S. where we provide operations, maintenance, overhaul and reconfiguration services to customers who own their own compression, production, processing, treating and related equipment. In our oil and gas product sales business line, we manufacture natural gas compression packages and oil and natural gas production and processing equipment for sale to our customers throughout the world and for use in our contract operations business line. In our Belleli EPC product sales business line that we are exiting, we have historically provided engineering, procurement and construction for the manufacture of tanks for tank farms and the manufacture of evaporators and brine heaters for desalination plants. As of December 31, 2016, we had five significant contracts in this business remaining and currently expect to have substantially exited this business by the first half of 2018. We also offer our customers, on either a contract operations basis or a sale basis, the engineering, design, project management, procurement and construction services necessary to incorporate our products into production, processing and compression facilities, which we refer to as integrated projects.\nAs discussed in Note 22 to the Financial Statements, we changed our reporting segments in the third quarter of 2016 to split our previously disclosed product sales segment into the following two new reportable segments: oil and gas product sales\u201d and Belleli EPC product sales.\u201d The contract operations and aftermarket services segments were not impacted by this change. The change in our reportable segments is reflected in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nSpin-off\nOn November 3, 2015, Archrock, Inc. (named Exterran Holdings, Inc. prior to November 3, 2015) ( Archrock\u201d) completed the spin-off (the Spin-off\u201d) of its international contract operations, international aftermarket services (the international contract operations and international aftermarket services businesses combined are referred to as the international services businesses\u201d and include such activities conducted outside of the U.S.) and global fabrication businesses into an independent, publicly traded company ( Exterran Corporation,\u201d our,\u201d we\u201d or us\u201d). To effect the Spin-off, on November 3, 2015, Archrock distributed, on a pro rata basis, all of our shares of common stock to its stockholders of record as of October 27, 2015 (the Record Date\u201d). Archrock shareholders received one share of Exterran Corporation common stock for every two shares of Archrock common stock held at the close of business on the Record Date. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement with Archrock and certain of our and Archrock's respective affiliates, on November 3, 2015, we transferred cash of $532.6 million to Archrock. Following the completion of the Spin-off, we and Archrock became and continue to be independent, publicly traded companies with separate boards of directors and management.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. All financial information presented for periods after the Spin-off represents our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows (referred to as the consolidated financial statements\u201d) and all financial information for periods prior to the Spin-off represents our combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows (referred to as the combined financial statements\u201d). Accordingly:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our consolidated and combined statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders' equity for the year ended December 31, 2015 consist of (i) the combined results of Archrock's international services and product sales businesses for the period between January 1, 2015 and November 3, 2015 and (ii) the consolidated results of Exterran Corporation for periods subsequent to November 3, 2015. Our combined statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders' equity for the year ended December 31, 2014 consist entirely of the combined results of Archrock's international services and product sales businesses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2016 and 2015 consist entirely of our consolidated balances.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe combined financial statements were derived from the accounting records of Archrock and reflect the combined historical results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Archrock's international services and product sales businesses. The combined financial statements were presented as if such businesses had been combined for periods prior to November 4, 2015. All intercompany transactions and accounts within these statements have been eliminated. Affiliate transactions between the international services and product sales businesses of Archrock and the other businesses of Archrock have been included in the combined financial statements, with the exception of oil and gas product sales within our wholly owned subsidiary, Exterran Energy Solutions, L.P. ( EESLP\u201d). Prior to the closing of the Spin-off, EESLP also had a fleet of compression units used to provide compression services in the U.S. services business of Archrock. Revenue has not been recognized in the combined statements of operations for the sale of compressor units by us that were used by EESLP to provide compression services to customers of the U.S. services business of Archrock. See Note 16 to the Financial Statements for further discussion on transactions with affiliates.\nThe combined statements of operations for periods prior to the Spin-off include expense allocations for certain functions historically performed by Archrock and not allocated to its operating segments, including allocations of expenses related to executive oversight, accounting, treasury, tax, legal, human resources, procurement and information technology. See Note 16 to the Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the allocation of corporate expenses. Additionally, third party debt of Archrock, other than debt attributable to capital leases, was not allocated to us for any of the periods prior to the Spin-off as we were not the legal obligor of the debt and Archrock's borrowings were not directly attributable to our business.\nWe refer to the consolidated and combined financial statements collectively as financial statements,\u201d and individually as balance sheets,\u201d statements of operations,\u201d statements of comprehensive income (loss),\u201d statements of stockholders' equity\u201d and statements of cash flows\u201d herein.\nExit of our Belleli Businesses\nIn the first quarter of 2016, we began executing a plan to exit certain Belleli businesses to focus on our core oil and gas businesses. Specifically, we began marketing for sale the Belleli CPE business comprising of engineering, procurement and manufacturing services related to the manufacture of critical process equipment for refinery and petrochemical facilities (referred to as Belleli CPE\u201d or the Belleli CPE business\u201d herein). In addition, we began executing our exit of the Belleli EPC business that has historically been comprised of engineering, procurement and construction for the manufacture of tanks for tank farms and the manufacture of evaporators and brine heaters for desalination plants in the Middle East (referred to as Belleli EPC\u201d or the Belleli EPC business\u201d herein). Belleli CPE met the held for sale criteria and is reflected as discontinued operations in our financial statements for all periods presented. In August 2016, we completed the sale of our Belleli CPE business to Tosto S.r.l. for cash proceeds of $5.5 million. Belleli CPE was previously included in our former product sales segment. In conjunction with the planned disposition of Belleli CPE, we recorded impairments of long-lived assets and current assets that totaled $68.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The impairment charges are reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax. In accordance with GAAP, Belleli EPC will be reflected as discontinued operations upon the substantial cessation of the remaining non-oil and gas business. During the first quarter of 2016, we ceased the booking of new orders for our Belleli EPC business. Our plan to exit our Belleli EPC business resulted in a reduction in the remaining useful lives of the assets that are currently used in the Belleli EPC business and a long-lived asset impairment charge of $0.7 million impacting results from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2016. Belleli EPC is represented by our Belleli EPC product sales segment.\nThe following table summarizes the operating results of our core oil and gas businesses and our Belleli businesses (in

Changes in our Belleli EPC backlog since March 31, 2016 reflect revenue recognized and change orders booked on existing contracts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIndustry Conditions and Trends\nOur business environment and corresponding operating results are affected by the level of energy industry spending for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. Spending by oil and natural gas exploration and production companies is dependent upon these companies' forecasts regarding the expected future supply, demand and pricing of oil and natural gas products as well as their estimates of risk-adjusted costs to find, develop and produce reserves. Although we believe our contract operations business, and to a lesser extent our oil and gas product sales business, is typically less impacted by commodity prices than certain other energy products and service providers, changes in oil and natural gas exploration and production spending normally result in changes in demand for our products and services.\nNatural gas consumption in the U.S. for the twelve months ended November 30, 2016 decreased by approximately 0.6% compared to the twelve months ended November 30, 2015. The U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA\u201d) forecasts that total U.S. natural gas consumption will increase by 0.4% in 2017 compared to 2016. As reported by the BP Energy Outlook 2017 edition ( BP Energy Outlook 2017\u201d), North American natural gas consumption and worldwide natural gas consumption is expected to grow annually by an average of approximately 1.4% and 1.9%, respectively, per year between 2015 and 2035.\nNatural gas marketed production in the U.S. for the twelve months ended November 30, 2016 decreased by approximately 1.2% compared to the twelve months ended November 30, 2015. The EIA forecasts that total U.S. natural gas marketed production will increase by 2% in 2017 compared to 2016. In addition, according to the BP Energy Outlook 2017, North American natural gas production and worldwide natural gas production is expected to grow annually by an average of approximately 2.4% and 1.8%, respectively, per year between 2015 and 2035.\nGlobal oil and U.S. natural gas prices declined significantly from the third quarter of 2014 through the middle of 2016, which led to declines in U.S. and worldwide capital spending for drilling activity in 2015. Given recent improvements in late 2016 to the market environment, we anticipate industry spending to increase in the U.S. with flat to slight declines in international spending in 2017.\nOur Performance Trends and Outlook\nOur revenue, earnings and financial position are affected by, among other things, market conditions that impact demand and pricing for natural gas compression and oil and natural gas production and processing and our customers' decisions among using our products and services, using our competitors' products and services or owning and operating the equipment themselves.\nDue to a significant decrease in oil and natural gas prices since the third quarter of 2014, overall market activity in North America remained at depressed levels for the majority of 2016. Low commodity prices in 2015 and the majority of 2016 have led to reduced drilling of oil and gas wells in North America. Oil and natural gas prices in North America improved late in 2016 over the lows experienced in the earlier part of the year, however, we believe higher commodity prices for a sustained period are necessary to encourage meaningful increases in customer spending. The Henry Hub spot price for natural gas was $3.71 per MMBtu at December 31, 2016, which was approximately 63% and 18% higher than prices at December 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the U.S. natural gas liquid composite price was approximately $5.45 per MMBtu for the month of November 2016, which was approximately 29% higher and 3% lower than prices for the months of December 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, the West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot price as of December 31, 2016 was approximately 45% and 1% higher than prices at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During periods of lower oil or natural gas prices, our customers typically decrease their capital expenditures, which generally results in lower activity levels. As a result of the low oil and natural gas price environment in North America during 2015 and the majority of 2016, our customers sought to reduce their capital and operating expenditure requirements, and as a result, the demand and pricing for the equipment we manufacture in North America was adversely impacted. Third party booking activity levels for our manufactured oil and gas products in North America during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $343.7 million, which represents a decline of approximately 12% and 68% compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and our North America oil and gas product sales backlog as of December 31, 2016 was $237.7 million, which represents an increase of approximately 6% and a decline of approximately 56% compared to December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We believe these booking levels reflect both our customers' reduced activity levels in response to the decline in commodity prices and caution on the part of our customers as they sought to reduce costs.\nSimilarly, in international markets, lower oil and natural gas prices have had a negative impact on the amount of capital investment by our customers in new projects. Our customers sought to reduce their capital and operating expenditure requirements due to lower oil and natural gas prices. As a result, the demand and pricing for our products and services in international markets was adversely impacted.\nIndustry forecasts indicate a sharp rise in U.S. shale fields spending is expected for 2017 with continued underinvestment in international markets. We believe international spending will recover more slowly than spending in North America, as the largest-in-class energy producers with more international exposure focus on debt reduction and returning cash to shareholders, while smaller, U.S.-centric resource holders invest to increase production in lower-cost shale plays. Demand for our oil and gas product sales in the U.S. could benefit from increased customer spending.\nDespite the anticipated slower recovery internationally, longer-term fundamentals in our international markets depends in part on international oil and gas infrastructure projects, many of which are based on longer-term plans of our customers that can be driven by their local market demand and local pricing for natural gas. As a result, we believe our international customers make decisions based on longer-term fundamentals that can be less tied to near term commodity prices than our North American customers. Therefore, we believe the demand for our products and services in international markets will continue, and we expect to have opportunities to grow our international businesses over the long term. Third party booking activity levels for our manufactured oil and gas products in international markets during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $87.5 million, which represents an increase of approximately 87% and a decline of approximately 76% compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and our international market oil and gas product sales backlog as of December 31, 2016 was $68.5 million, which represents an increase of approximately 57% and a decline of approximately 70% compared to December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The fluctuations in the size of our bid proposals for new contracts tend to create variability in booking activity levels in international markets from period to period.\nAggregate third party booking activity levels for our manufactured oil and gas products in North America and international markets during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $431.2 million, which represents a decline of approximately 1% and 70% compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The aggregate oil and gas product sales backlog for our manufactured products in North America and international markets as of December 31, 2016 was $306.2 million, which represents an increase of approximately 15% and a decline of approximately 60% compared to December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nSince the first quarter of 2016, we have been executing activities necessary to exit the Belleli EPC product sales business. At December 31, 2016, we had five significant contracts in the remaining business and expect to have substantially exited the business by the first half of 2018. Based on contractual requirements, the progress on the projects and the status of negotiations with the related customers, as of December 31, 2016, a liability for estimated penalties for liquidated damages of $18.3 million has been included in our financial statements primarily due to our actual or projected failure to meet certain specified contractual milestone dates. We have asserted claims, or intend to assert claims, and are negotiating change orders, that if settled favorably, could result in recoveries for us, including a release of such claims in exchange for release of liquidated damages.\nThe timing of any change in activity levels by our customers is difficult to predict. As a result, our ability to project the anticipated activity level for our business, and particularly our oil and gas product sales segment, is limited. In the latter part of 2016, we experienced an increase in oil and gas product sales bookings. However, volatility in commodity prices could delay investments by our customers in significant projects, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur level of capital spending depends on our forecast for the demand for our products and services and the equipment required to provide services to our customers. Based on demand we see for contract operations, we anticipate investing more capital in our contract operations business in 2017 than we did in 2016.\nCertain Key Challenges and Uncertainties\nMarket conditions and competition in the oil and natural gas industry and the risks inherent in international markets continue to represent key challenges and uncertainties. In addition to these challenges, we believe the following represent some of the key challenges and uncertainties we will face in the future:\nGlobal Energy Markets and Oil and Natural Gas Pricing. Our results of operations depend upon the level of activity in the global energy markets, including oil and natural gas development, production, processing and transportation. Oil and natural gas prices and the level of drilling and exploration activity can be volatile and have fallen significantly in recent years. As a result, many producers in the U.S. and other parts of the world, including our customers, significantly reduced their capital and operating spending in 2015 and 2016. If oil and natural gas exploration and development activity and the number of well completions continue to decline due to the reduction in oil and natural gas prices or significant instability in energy markets, we would anticipate a continued decrease in demand and pricing for our natural gas compression and oil and natural gas production and processing equipment and services. For example, unfavorable market conditions or financial difficulties experienced by our customers may result in cancellation of contracts or the delay or abandonment of projects, which could cause our cash flows generated by our product sales and international services to decline and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nExecution on Larger Contract Operations and Product Sales Projects. Some of our projects are significant in size and scope, which can translate into more technically challenging conditions or performance specifications for our products and services. Contracts with our customers generally specify delivery dates, performance criteria and penalties for our failure to perform. Any failure to execute such larger projects in a timely and cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMaintaining Expense Levels in Line with Activity Decreases. Given the volatility of the global energy markets and industry capital spending activity levels, we have and will continue to monitor and control our expense levels, including personnel head count and costs, to protect our profitability. Some of these expenses are difficult to reduce, and if we are not able to reduce them commensurate with activity decreases, our profitability will be negatively impacted. Any failure to reduce costs in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSummary of Results\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the Financial Statements, the results from continuing operations for all periods presented exclude the results of our Venezuelan contract operations and Belleli CPE businesses. Those results are reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nRevenue. Revenue during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $1,029.3 million, $1,790.5 million and $2,101.7 million, respectively. The decrease in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily caused by revenue decreases in our oil and gas product and contract operations segments. The decrease in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was caused by revenue decreases in all four of our segments.\nNet income. We generated net loss of $227.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, and net income of $26.6 million and $115.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in net income during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in gross margin in our oil and gas product sales and contract operations segments, non-cash valuation allowances of $119.8 million recorded against U.S. deferred tax assets during 2016, impairment charges reflected in loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $68.8 million related to Belleli CPE during 2016 and increases in interest expense and restatement charges. These activities were partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expense, foreign currency gains of $6.4 million during 2016 compared to foreign currency losses of $35.8 million during 2015, estimated loss contract provisions of $30.1 million recorded on significant Belleli EPC product sales projects during 2015 and a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense. Net loss during the year ended December 31, 2016 included loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $33.6 million and net income during the year ended December 31, 2015 included income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $54.8 million. The decrease in net income during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in gross margin in our oil and gas product sales and contract operations segments, an increase in restructuring and other charges, a $26.5 million increase in translation losses related to the functional currency remeasurement of our foreign subsidiaries' non-functional currency denominated intercompany obligations, an increase in long-lived asset impairment and a $16.0 million decrease in proceeds received from the sale of our Venezuelan subsidiary's assets to PDVSA Gas S.A. ( PDVSA Gas\u201d). These activities were partially offset by decreases in SG&A expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense. Net income during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 included income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $54.8 million and $67.2 million, respectively.\nEBITDA, as adjusted. Our EBITDA, as adjusted, was $145.1 million, $240.6 million and $293.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. EBITDA, as adjusted, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased primarily due to a decrease in gross margin in our oil and gas product sales and contract operations segments, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expense and estimated loss contract provisions of $30.1 million recorded on significant Belleli EPC product sales projects during 2015. EBITDA, as adjusted, during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased primarily due to a decrease in gross margin in our oil and gas product sales and contract operations segments, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expense. For a reconciliation of EBITDA, as adjusted, to net income (loss), its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read Part II, Item 6 ( Selected Financial Data - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d) of this report.\nResults by Business Segment.

These decreases were partially offset by an $18.3 million increase in revenue in Brazil primarily driven by the start-up of a project during the second half of 2015. Gross margin decreased during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the revenue decrease described above, excluding the devaluation of the Argentine peso as the impact on gross margin was insignificant. Gross margin percentage during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 remained flat. The early termination of a project in the Eastern Hemisphere resulted in additional costs during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 in the form of depreciation expense, which is excluded from gross margin. Additionally, excluded from cost of sales and recorded to restructuring and other charges in our statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2015 were non-cash inventory write-downs of $4.2 million associated with the Spin-off primarily related to the decentralization of shared inventory components between Archrock's North America contract operations business and our international contract operations business.\nAftermarket Services\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization expense)\n</td> <td>87,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in revenue of $7.1 million in Gabon driven by our cessation of activities in the Gabon market during the first quarter of 2015.

During the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, revenue decreased by $528.2 million, $101.4 million and $67.6 million in North America, the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America, respectively. The decrease in revenue in North America was due to decreases of $270.8 million, $212.1 million and $45.3 million in production and processing equipment revenue, compression equipment revenue and installation revenue, respectively. The decrease in the Eastern Hemisphere revenue was due to decreases of $40.4 million, $31.3 million and $29.7 million in installation revenue, compression equipment revenue and production and processing equipment revenue, respectively. The decrease in Latin America revenue was due to decreases of $35.6 million, $24.2 million and $7.8 million in compression equipment revenue, installation revenue and production and processing equipment revenue, respectively. The decreases in gross margin and gross margin percentage were primarily caused by the revenue decrease explained above, continued weakening market conditions resulting in a competitive pricing environment and an increase in under-absorption caused by reduced activities and management's decision to maintain a certain level of manufacturing capacity. Excluded from cost of sales and recorded to restructuring and other charges in our statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2015 were non-cash inventory write-downs of $4.5 million primarily related to our decision to exit the manufacturing of cold weather packages, which had historically been performed at an oil and gas product sales facility in North America we decided to close.\nBelleli EPC Product Sales\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization expense)\n</td> <td>126,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,466\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(31,625\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by schedule delays on significant projects during the prior year that resulted in increases to cost-to-complete estimates on each of the related projects, which adversely impacted revenue recognized under the percentage-of-completion accounting principles in the prior year. The increases in gross margin and gross margin percentage were primarily caused by estimated loss contract provisions of $30.1 million recorded on significant projects during 2015 driven by project execution delays, partially offset by additional costs charged to one project related to a warranty expense accrual of $1.5 million during 2016.

SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 16% and 12% during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a significant decrease in oil and gas product sales revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. For the periods prior to the Spin-off, SG&A expense includes expense allocations for certain functions, including allocations of expenses related to executive oversight, accounting, treasury, tax, legal, human resources, procurement and information technology services performed by Archrock on a centralized basis that historically have not been recorded at the segment level. These costs were allocated to us systematically based on specific department function and revenue. Included in SG&A expense during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $46.9 million of allocated corporate expenses incurred by Archrock. The actual costs we would have incurred if we had been a stand-alone public company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased primarily due to a decrease of $16.5 million in depreciation expense on certain contract operations projects in Latin America primarily related to capitalized installation costs that were fully depreciated during 2016 and 2015. Capitalized installation costs, included, among other things, civil engineering, piping, electrical instrumentation and project management costs.\nLong-lived asset impairment\nWe regularly review the future deployment of our idle compression assets used in our contract operations segment for units that are not of the type, configuration, condition, make or model that are cost efficient to maintain and operate. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we determined that 62 idle compressor units totaling approximately 65,000 horsepower would be retired from the active fleet. The retirement of these units from the active fleet triggered a review of these assets for impairment, and as a result, we recorded a $12.7 million asset impairment to reduce the book value of each unit to its estimated fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we determined that 93 idle compressor units totaling approximately 72,000 horsepower would be retired from the active fleet. The retirement of these units from the active fleet triggered a review of these assets for impairment, and as a result, we recorded a $19.4 million asset impairment to reduce the book value of each unit to its estimated fair value.\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the Financial Statements, in the first quarter of 2016, we began executing a plan to exit our Belleli EPC business to focus on our core oil and gas businesses. Because we ceased the booking of new orders for the manufacture of tanks for tank farms and the manufacture of evaporators and brine heaters for desalination plants, customer relationship intangible assets related to our Belleli EPC business were assessed to have no future benefit to us. As a result, we recorded a long-lived asset impairment charge of $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, the property, plant and equipment of our Belleli EPC business was reviewed for recoverability. As a result, the remaining useful lives of Belleli EPC non-oil and gas property, plant and equipment were reduced to reflect their estimated cessation date.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we evaluated other assets for impairment and recorded long-lived asset impairments of $1.7 million on these assets.\nDuring the first quarter of 2015, we evaluated a long-term note receivable from the purchaser of our Canadian Operations for impairment. This review was triggered by an offer from the purchaser of our Canadian Operations to prepay the note receivable at a discount to its then current book value. The fair value of the note receivable as of March 31, 2015 was based on the amount offered by the purchaser of our Canadian Operations to prepay the note receivable. The difference between the book value of the note receivable at March 31, 2015 and its fair value resulted in the recording of an impairment of long-lived assets of $1.4 million. In April 2015, we accepted the offer to early settle this note receivable.\nRestatement charges\nAs discussed in Note 13 to the Financial Statements, during the first quarter of 2016, our senior management identified errors relating to the application of percentage-of-completion accounting principles to specific Belleli EPC product sales projects. As a result, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors initiated an internal investigation, including the use of services of a forensic accounting firm. Management also engaged a consulting firm to assist in accounting analysis and compilation of restatement adjustments. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $30.1 million of costs associated with the restatement of our financial statements and current SEC investigation, of which $11.2 million of cash was recovered from Archrock in the fourth quarter of 2016 pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement.\nRestructuring and other charges\nIn the second quarter of 2015, we announced a cost reduction plan, primarily focused on workforce reductions and the reorganization of certain facilities. These actions were in response to unfavorable market conditions in North America combined with the impact of lower international activity due to customer budget cuts driven by lower oil prices. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $23.5 million of restructuring and other charges as a result of this plan, which were primarily related to $19.9 million of employee termination benefits and a $2.9 million charge for the exit of a corporate building under an operating lease. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $15.6 million of restructuring and other charges as a result of this plan, which were primarily related to $9.6 million of employee termination benefits and $4.0 million of non-cash write-downs of inventory. The non-cash inventory write-downs were the result of our decision to exit the manufacturing of cold weather packages, which had historically been performed at an oil and gas product sales facility in North America we decided to close in 2015. Additionally, we incurred restructuring and other charges associated with the Spin-off. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $3.9 million of costs associated with the Spin-off, which were primarily related to expenses of $3.1 million for retention awards to certain employees. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $15.7 million of costs associated with the Spin-off, which were primarily related to non-cash inventory write-downs of $4.7 million, financial advisor fees of $4.6 million paid at the completion of the Spin-off, expenses of $3.1 million for retention awards to certain employees and a one-time cash signing bonus of $2.0 million paid to our new Chief Executive Officer. Non-cash inventory write-downs were primarily related to the decentralization of shared inventory components between Archrock's North America contract operations business and our international contract operations business. The charges incurred in conjunction with the cost reduction plan and Spin-off are included in restructuring and other charges in our statements of operations. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of these charges.\nInterest expense\nThe increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan facility (collectively, the Credit Facility\u201d) that became available on November 3, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the average daily outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility were $422.9 million. Prior to the Spin-off, third party debt of Archrock, other than debt attributable to capital leases, was not allocated to us as we were not the legal obligor of the debt and Archrock's borrowings were not directly attributable to our business.\nEquity in income of non-consolidated affiliates\nIn March 2012, our Venezuelan joint ventures sold their assets to PDVSA Gas. We received installment payments, including an annual charge, of $10.4 million and $15.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the remaining principal amount due to us was approximately $4 million. Payments we receive from the sale will be recognized as equity in income of non-consolidated affiliates in our statements of operations in the periods such payments are received.\nOther (income) expense, net\nThe change in other (income) expense, net, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to foreign currency gains, net of losses on foreign currency derivatives, of $5.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to foreign currency losses of $35.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Our foreign currency gains and losses included translation gains, net of losses on foreign currency derivatives, of $8.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to translation losses of $30.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the currency remeasurement of our foreign subsidiaries' non-functional currency denominated intercompany obligations. Of the foreign currency losses recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015, $29.7 million was attributable to our Brazil subsidiary's U.S. dollar denominated intercompany obligations and were the result of a currency devaluation in Brazil and increases in our Brazil subsidiary's intercompany payables during the prior year. The change in other (income) expense, net, was also due to a $4.9 million loss recognized during the prior year on short-term investments related to the purchase of $18.4 million of Argentine government issued U.S. dollar denominated bonds using Argentine pesos.\nIncome Taxes\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>215\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>(179.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>346.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(525.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our effective tax rate of (179.2)% was adversely impacted by valuation allowances recorded against U.S. deferred tax assets and activity at our non-U.S. subsidiaries, which included valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets, foreign currency devaluations and the settlement of a foreign audit. These negative impacts were partially offset by nontaxable Venezuelan joint venture proceeds and a net nontaxable capital contribution related to the Spin-off.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our effective tax rate of 346.3% was adversely impacted by activity at our non-U.S. subsidiaries, which included valuation allowances recorded against certain net operating losses, foreign currency devaluations, foreign dividend withholding taxes and deemed distributions to the U.S. These negative impacts were partially offset by tax benefits related to claiming the research and development credit (the R&D Credit\u201d) and nontaxable Venezuelan joint venture proceeds.\nOur effective tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn, or losses we incur, in those jurisdictions. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year.

We received installment payments, including an annual charge, totaling $38.8 million and $56.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the remaining principal amount due to us was approximately $33 million. We have not recognized amounts payable to us by PDVSA Gas as a receivable and will therefore recognize payments received in the future as income from discontinued operations in the periods such payments are received. The proceeds from the sale of the assets are not subject to Venezuelan national taxes due to an exemption allowed under the Venezuelan Reserve Law applicable to expropriation settlements. In addition, and in connection with the sale, we and the Venezuelan government agreed to waive rights to assert certain claims against each other.\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the Financial Statements, in the first quarter of 2016, we began executing a plan to exit our Belleli CPE business, which provided engineering, procurement and manufacturing services related to the manufacture of critical process equipment for refinery and petrochemical facilities. We completed the sale of Belleli CPE in August 2016. Our Belleli CPE business was previously included in our former product sales segment. In conjunction with the planned disposition, we recorded impairments of long-lived assets and current assets that totaled $68.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The impairment charges are reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax.\nThe Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nContract Operations\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>469,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>493,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization expense)\n</td> <td>172,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>297,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>308,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to a $19.9 million decrease in revenue in Brazil primarily related to a project which had little incremental costs that commenced and terminated operations in 2014 partially offset by the start-up of new projects during 2015 and a $7.4 million decrease in revenue in the Eastern Hemisphere primarily driven by a decrease in Nigeria. These decreases were partially offset by a $6.8 million increase in revenue in Mexico primarily driven by contracts that commenced or were expanded in scope in 2014 and 2015. Gross margin decreased during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the revenue decrease explained above. Gross margin percentage during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 increased primarily due to a reduction in operating expenses in Latin America driven by our cost reduction plan during 2015 and the devaluation of the Brazilian Real in 2015 which had a positive impact on gross margin percentage, partially offset by the revenue decrease explained above. While our gross margin during the year ended December 31, 2014 benefited from the start-up of a Brazilian project, our contract operations business is capital intensive, and as such, we did have additional costs in the form of depreciation expense, which is excluded from gross margin. Additionally, excluded from cost of sales and recorded to restructuring and other charges in our statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2015 were non-cash inventory write-downs of $4.2 million associated with the Spin-off primarily related to the decentralization of shared inventory components between Archrock's North America contract operations business and our international contract operations business.\nAftermarket Services\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization expense)\n</td> <td>91,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to decreases in revenue in the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America of $24.6 million and $10.8 million, respectively. The decrease in revenue in the Eastern Hemisphere was primarily caused by a decrease in revenue of $9.3 million as a result of the sale of our Australian business in December 2014, an $8.0 million decrease in revenue in Gabon driven by our cessation of activities in the Gabon market in 2015 and a decrease of $4.4 million in part sales in China. The decrease in revenue in Latin America was primarily caused by a decrease of $8.3 million in Bolivia driven by the termination of parts, services and maintenance contracts during 2015. Gross margin decreased during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to decreases in gross margin in Latin America and the Eastern Hemisphere of $3.0 million and $2.7 million, respectively. Gross margin percentage during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 increased primarily due to the receipt of a settlement from a customer in Gabon during the year ended December 31, 2015, which positively impacted revenue and gross margin by $3.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively, and a decrease of $0.8 million in expense for inventory reserves.\nOil and Gas Product Sales\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,089,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,329,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization expense)\n</td> <td>925,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,089,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>163,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>240,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to a decrease in revenue in North America and the Eastern Hemisphere of $194.0 million and $82.3 million, respectively, partially offset by higher revenue in Latin America of $36.3 million. The decrease in revenue in North America was due to decreases of $109.2 million and $92.6 million in compression equipment revenue and production and processing equipment revenue, respectively, partially offset by an increase of $7.8 million in installation revenue. The decrease in the Eastern Hemisphere revenue was due to decreases of $33.7 million, $28.6 million and $20.0 million in compression equipment revenue, installation revenue and production and processing equipment revenue, respectively. The increase in Latin America revenue was primarily due to increases of $25.9 million and $10.1 million in compression equipment revenue and installation revenue, respectively. The decreases in gross margin and gross margin percentage were primarily caused by the revenue decrease explained above, weakening market conditions resulting in lower bookings at more competitive prices in North America and an increase of $3.2 million in expense for inventory reserves in North America. These decreases were partially offset by costs charged to one project in North America related to a warranty expense accrual of approximately $7.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluded from cost of sales and recorded to restructuring and other charges in our statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2015 were non-cash inventory write-downs of $4.5 million primarily related to our decision to exit the manufacturing of cold weather packages, which had historically been performed at a product sales facility in North America we decided to close.\nBelleli EPC Product Sales\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization expense)\n</td> <td>134,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(31,625\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(33,391\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily driven by schedule delays on significant projects during 2015 that resulted in increases to cost-to-complete estimates on each related projects, which adversely impacted revenue recognized under the percentage-of-completion accounting principles in 2015. Project execution delays on significant projects during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 resulted in estimated loss contract provisions of $30.1 million and $36.6 million, respectively, which negatively impacted gross margin percentage for each period.

These costs were allocated to us systematically based on specific department function and revenue. Included in SG&A expense during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were corporate expenses incurred by Archrock prior to the Spin-off. The actual costs we would have incurred if we had been a stand-alone public company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure. The decrease in SG&A expense during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was attributable to an $11.2 million decrease in compensation and benefits costs in the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America primarily driven by our cost reduction plan during 2015, a $9.8 million decrease in selling expenses relating to our product sales business in North America, a $6.2 million decrease in corporate expenses and a $3.1 million decrease in non-income-based local taxes in Brazil. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 12% and 13% during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased primarily due to $26.4 million in depreciation of installation costs recognized during the year ended December 31, 2014 on a contract operations project in Brazil that commenced and terminated operations in 2014. Prior to the start-up of this project, we capitalized $1.9 million and $24.5 million of installation costs during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In late 2015, we received a customer notice of early termination on a contact operations project in the Eastern Hemisphere specifying an end date of January 2016. The project had been operating since the third quarter of 2009. As a result, we recorded additional depreciation expense of $10.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 primarily related to capitalized installation costs. Capitalized installation costs, included, among other things, civil engineering, piping, electrical instrumentation and project management costs.\nLong-lived asset impairment\nWe regularly review the future deployment of our idle compression assets used in our contract operations segment for units that are not of the type, configuration, condition, make or model that are cost efficient to maintain and operate. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we determined that 93 idle compressor units totaling approximately 72,000 horsepower would be retired from the active fleet. The retirement of these units from the active fleet triggered a review of these assets for impairment, and as a result, we recorded a $19.4 million asset impairment to reduce the book value of each unit to its estimated fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we determined that 20 idle compressor units totaling approximately 18,000 horsepower would be retired from the active fleet, and as a result, we performed an impairment review and recorded a $2.8 million asset impairment to reduce the book value of each unit to its estimated fair value. In connection with our fleet review during the year ended December 31, 2014, we evaluated for impairment idle units that had been culled from our fleet in prior years and were available for sale. Based upon that review, we reduced the expected proceeds from disposition for certain of the remaining units. This resulted in an additional impairment of $1.1 million to reduce the book value of each unit to its estimated fair value during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDuring the first quarter of 2015, we evaluated a long-term note receivable from the purchaser of our Canadian Operations for impairment. This review was triggered by an offer from the purchaser of our Canadian Operations to prepay the note receivable at a discount to its then current book value. The fair value of the note receivable as of March 31, 2015 was based on the amount offered by the purchaser of our Canadian Operations to prepay the note receivable. The difference between the book value of the note receivable at March 31, 2015 and its fair value resulted in the recording of an impairment of long-lived assets of $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. In April 2015, we accepted the offer to early settle this note receivable.\nRestructuring and other charges\nIn the second quarter of 2015, we announced a cost reduction plan, primarily focused on workforce reductions and the reorganization of certain product sales facilities. These actions were in response to market conditions in North America combined with the impact of lower international activity due to customer budget cuts driven by lower oil prices. As a result of this plan, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $15.6 million of restructuring and other charges, of which $9.6 million related to termination benefits, $4.0 million related to non-cash write-downs of inventory and $1.9 million related to consulting fees. The non-cash inventory write-downs were the result of our decision to exit the manufacturing of cold weather packages, which had historically been performed at a product sales facility in North America we decided to close. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $15.7 million of costs associated with the Spin-off which were related to non-cash inventory write-downs of $4.7 million, financial advisor fees of $4.6 million paid at the completion of the Spin-off, expenses of $3.1 million for retention awards to certain employees, a one-time cash signing bonus paid to our new Chief Executive Officer of $2.0 million and costs to start-up certain stand-alone functions of $1.3 million. Non-cash inventory write-downs were primarily related to the decentralization of shared inventory components between Archrock's North America contract operations business and our international contract operations business. The charges incurred in conjunction with the cost reduction plan and Spin-off are included in restructuring and other charges in our statements of operations. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of these charges.\nInterest expense\nThe increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to borrowings under our Credit Facility that became available on November 3, 2015. During the period between November 3, 2015 and December 31, 2015, the average daily outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility were $557.0 million. Prior to the Spin-off, third party debt of Archrock, other than debt attributable to capital leases, was not allocated to us as we were not the legal obligor of the debt and Archrock's borrowings were not directly attributable to our business.\nEquity in income of non-consolidated affiliates\nIn March 2012, our Venezuelan joint ventures sold their assets to PDVSA Gas. We received installment payments, including an annual charge, of $15.2 million and $14.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Payments we receive from the sale will be recognized as equity in income of non-consolidated affiliates in our statements of operations in the periods such payments are received.\nOther (income) expense, net\nThe change in other (income) expense, net, was primarily due to foreign currency losses of $35.8 million and $7.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our foreign currency losses included translation losses of $30.1 million and $3.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the currency remeasurement of our foreign subsidiaries' non-functional currency denominated intercompany obligations. Of the foreign currency losses recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015, $29.7 million was attributable to our Brazil subsidiary's U.S. dollar denominated intercompany obligations and were the result of a currency devaluation in Brazil and increases in our Brazil subsidiary's intercompany payables during 2015.\nIncome Taxes\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>346.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>284.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our effective tax rate of 346.3% was adversely impacted by activity at our non-U.S. subsidiaries, which included valuation allowances recorded against certain net operating losses, foreign currency devaluations, foreign dividend withholding taxes and deemed distributions to the U.S. These negative impacts were partially offset by tax benefits related to claiming the research and development credit (the R&D Credit\u201d) and nontaxable Venezuelan joint venture proceeds.\nOur effective tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn, or losses we incur, in those jurisdictions. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year. In addition to net state income taxes, the following items had the most significant impact on the difference between our statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% and our effective tax rate.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A $38.1 million (333.2%) increase resulting primarily from foreign withholding taxes, negative impacts of foreign currency devaluations in Argentina and Mexico and deemed distributions to the U.S. from certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.

We received installment payments, including an annual charge, totaling $56.6 million and $72.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The proceeds from the sale of the assets are not subject to Venezuelan national taxes due to an exemption allowed under the Venezuelan Reserve Law applicable to expropriation settlements. In addition, and in connection with the sale, we and the Venezuelan government agreed to waive rights to assert certain claims against each other.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur unrestricted cash balance was $35.7 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $29.0 million at December 31, 2015. Working capital decreased to $177.8 million at December 31, 2016 from $408.5 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease in working capital was primarily due to a concerted effort to reduce working capital levels and a decrease in oil and gas product sales activity. The decrease in working capital included decreases in accounts receivable, inventory, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and current assets associated with discontinued operations, partially offset by a decrease in current liabilities associated with discontinued operations. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily driven by lower oil and gas product sales activity in North America and the timing of payments received from customers during the current year. The decreases in current assets and liabilities associated with discontinued operations were primarily due to the sale of Belleli CPE in August 2016. The decrease in inventory was primarily driven by a decrease in raw materials and finished goods largely resulting from lower oil and gas product sales activity in North America. The decrease in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts was primarily driven by lower oil and gas product sales activity in North America and the timing of billings on Belleli EPC product sales projects.\nOur cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the statements of cash flows, are summarized in the table below (in thousands):\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) continuing operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>265,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(60,998\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(129,611\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(230,747\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55,002\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(1,832\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,716\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discontinued operations\n</td> <td>34,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,329\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to working capital decreases in the current year compared to working capital increases in the prior year and lower SG&A expense during the current year, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin in our oil and gas product sales and contract operations segments and an increase in interest paid. Working capital changes during the year ended December 31, 2016 included a decrease of $135.9 million in accounts receivable, a decrease of $49.7 million in inventory, a decrease of $37.6 million in costs and estimated earnings versus billings on uncompleted contracts. Working capital changes during the year ended December 31, 2015 included a decrease of $82.7 million in accounts payable and other liabilities and a decrease of $80.4 million in inventory.\nInvesting Activities. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to an $82.4 million decrease in capital expenditures, partially offset by $5.4 million of net proceeds received from the settlement of our outstanding note receivable for the sale of our Canadian Operations in the prior year, a $4.8 million decrease in cash payments received from the sale of our Venezuelan joint ventures' previously nationalized assets and a $3.8 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily driven by installation costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015 on contract operations projects in Brazil and Bolivia that began operations during the second half of 2015 and first quarter of 2016, respectively, and a decrease in maintenance capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities. The increase in net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to net repayments of $179.5 million on our Credit Facility during the current year, a transfer of cash during the current year of $49.2 million to Archrock pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, partially offset by net distributions to parent of $39.0 million and $13.3 million in payments of debt issuance costs related to the Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2015. The transfer of cash to Archrock during the year ended December 31, 2016 was triggered by our receipt of payments from PDVSA Gas in respect of the sale of our and our joint ventures' previously nationalized assets. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we transferred $532.6 million of net proceeds from borrowings under the Credit Facility to Archrock pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement.\nDiscontinued Operations. The decrease in net cash provided by discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to $17.8 million decrease in proceeds received from the sale of our Venezuelan subsidiary's assets to PDVSA Gas, partially offset by cash proceeds of $5.5 million received from the sale of our Belleli CPE business in August 2016.\nCapital Requirements. Our contract operations business is capital intensive, requiring significant investment to maintain and upgrade existing operations. Our capital spending is primarily dependent on the demand for our contract operations services and the availability of the type of equipment required for us to render those contract operations services to our customers. Our capital requirements have consisted primarily of, and we anticipate will continue to consist of, the following:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>growth capital expenditures, which are made to expand or to replace partially or fully depreciated assets or to expand the operating capacity or revenue generating capabilities of existing or new assets, whether through construction, acquisition or modification; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maintenance capital expenditures, which are made to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and related cash flows further extending the useful lives of the assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe majority of our growth capital expenditures are related to the acquisition cost of new compressor units and processing and treating equipment that we add to our contract operations fleet and installation costs on integrated projects. In addition, growth capital expenditures can include the upgrading of major components on an existing compressor unit where the current configuration of the compressor unit is no longer in demand and the compressor unit is not likely to return to an operating status without the capital expenditures. These latter expenditures substantially modify the operating parameters of the compressor unit such that it can be used in applications for which it previously was not suited. Maintenance capital expenditures are related to major overhauls of significant components of a compressor unit, such as the engine, compressor and cooler, that return the components to a like new\u201d condition, but do not modify the applications for which the compressor unit was designed.\nGrowth capital expenditures were $53.0 million, $105.2 million and $97.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in growth capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in installation expenditures on integrated projects in Bolivia and Brazil. The increase in growth capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to an increase in installation expenditures on integrated projects in Bolivia and Brazil during 2015, partially offset by investments in new compression equipment in Latin America in 2014 and installation expenditures on integrated projects in Brazil and Mexico during 2014.\nMaintenance capital expenditures were $14.4 million, $27.3 million and $24.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in maintenance capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to delayed discretionary spending as a result of the market downturn. Historically, maintenance capital expenditures have remained relatively flat from year to year primarily as a result of routine scheduled overhaul activities. We intend to grow our business both organically and through third-party acquisitions. If we are successful in growing our business in the future, we would expect our maintenance capital expenditures to increase over the long term.\nWe generally invest funds necessary to manufacture contract operations fleet additions when our idle equipment cannot be reconfigured to economically fulfill a project's requirements and the new equipment expenditure is expected to generate economic returns over its expected useful life that exceeds our targeted return on capital. We currently plan to spend approximately $150 million to $180 million in capital expenditures during 2017, including (1) approximately $125 million to $145 million on contract operations growth capital expenditures and (2) approximately $15 million to $20 million on equipment maintenance capital related to our contract operations business.\nLong-Term Debt. On July 10, 2015, we and our wholly owned subsidiary, EESLP, entered into a $750.0 million credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Wells Fargo, as the administrative agent, and various financial institutions as lenders. On October 5, 2015, the parties amended and restated the Credit Agreement to provide for a $925.0 million credit facility, consisting of a $680.0 million revolving credit facility and a $245.0 million term loan facility (collectively, the Credit Facility\u201d). The Credit Facility became available to us on November 3, 2015 (referred to as the Initial Availability Date\u201d). On November 3, 2015, EESLP incurred approximately $300.0 million of indebtedness under the revolving credit facility and $245.0 million of indebtedness under the term loan facility. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement with Archrock and certain of our and Archrock's respective affiliates, on November 3, 2015, EESLP transferred $532.6 million of net proceeds from borrowings under the Credit Facility to Archrock to allow it to repay a portion of its indebtedness in connection with the Spin-off. In accordance with the Credit Agreement, we are required to repay borrowings outstanding under the term loan facility on each anniversary of the Initial Availability Date in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) $12.3 million and (ii) the outstanding principal balance of the term loan facility. In November 2016, we repaid $12.3 million of borrowings outstanding under the term loan facility. The principal amount of $232.8 million due in November 2017 under the term loan facility is classified as long-term in our balance sheet at December 31, 2016 because we have the intent and ability to refinance the current principal amount due with borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility. On April 22, 2016, June 17, 2016, August 24, 2016 and November 22, 2016, we and our wholly owned subsidiary, EESLP, entered into amendments to the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo, as the administrative agent, and various financial institutions as lenders. See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for further discussion regarding these amendments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the average daily borrowings under the Credit Facility were $422.9 million. During the period between November 3, 2015 and December 31, 2015, the average daily borrowings under the Credit Facility were $557.0 million. The weighted average annual interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 5.0% and 3.1%, respectively. The annual interest rate on the outstanding balance of the term loan facility at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 6.8%.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $118.0 million in outstanding borrowings and $57.1 million in outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2016, taking into account guarantees through letters of credit, we had undrawn capacity of $504.9 million under our revolving credit facility. Our Credit Agreement limits our Total Debt (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) ratio on the last day of the fiscal quarter to not greater than 3.75 to 1.0 (which will increase to 4.50 to 1.0 following the completion of a qualified capital raise). As a result of this limitation, $226.9 million of the $504.9 million of undrawn capacity under our revolving credit facility was available for additional borrowings as of December 31, 2016. Because this limitation considers all of our outstanding debt obligations, the additional borrowings available to us are in excess of borrowings needed under our revolving credit facility to refinance the current principal amount due under the term loan facility.\nWe are required to prepay borrowings outstanding under the term loan facility with the net proceeds of certain asset sales, equity issuances, debt incurrences and other events (subject to, in certain circumstances, our right to reinvest the proceeds within a specified period). In addition, if the total leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) as of the last day in any fiscal year is greater than 2.50 to 1.00, we are required to prepay borrowings outstanding under the term loan facility with a portion of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for that fiscal year equal to (a) 50% of Excess Cash Flow if the total leverage ratio is greater than 3.00 to 1.00 or (b) 25% of Excess Cash Flow if the total leverage ratio is greater than 2.50 to 1.00 but less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00.\nThe Credit Agreement contains various covenants with which we, EESLP and our respective restricted subsidiaries must comply, including, but not limited to, limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, investments, liens on assets, repurchasing equity, making distributions, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, dispositions of assets and other provisions customary in similar types of agreements. We are required to maintain, on a consolidated basis, a minimum interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 2.25 to 1.00; a maximum total leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 3.75 to 1.00 prior to the completion of a qualified capital raise and 4.50 to 1.00 thereafter; and, following the completion of a qualified capital raise, a maximum senior secured leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 2.75 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2016, Exterran Corporation maintained a 5.5 to 1.0 interest coverage ratio, a 2.3 to 1.0 total leverage ratio and a 2.3 to 1.0 senior secured leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nHistorically, we have financed capital expenditures primarily with net cash provided by operating activities. Our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to do so, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to maintain our operations and to grow. If any of our lenders become unable to perform their obligations under our Credit Facility, our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility could be reduced. Inability to borrow additional amounts under our revolving credit facility could limit our ability to fund our future growth and operations. Based on current market conditions, we expect that net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operating expenditures, capital expenditures and scheduled interest and debt repayments through December 31, 2017; however, to the extent they are not, we may seek additional debt or equity financing. Additionally, our term loan facility matures in November 2017. At or prior to the time the term loan matures, we will be required to refinance it and may enter into one or more new facilities, which could result in higher borrowing costs, issue equity, which would dilute our existing shareholders, repay with borrowings under our revolving credit facility, issue bonds with restrictive covenants that could impact our business flexibility or otherwise raise the funds necessary to repay the outstanding principal amount under the term loan.\nContingencies to Archrock. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, EESLP contributed to a subsidiary of Archrock the right to receive payments based on a notional amount corresponding to payments received by our subsidiaries from PDVSA Gas in respect of the sale of our and our joint ventures' previously nationalized assets promptly after such amounts are collected by our subsidiaries until Archrock's subsidiary has received an aggregate amount of such payments up to the lesser of (i) $125.8 million, plus the aggregate amount of all reimbursable expenses incurred by Archrock and its subsidiaries in connection with recovering any PDVSA Gas default installment payments following the completion of the Spin-off or (ii) $150.0 million. Our balance sheets do not reflect this contingent liability to Archrock or the amount payable to us by PDVSA Gas as a receivable. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, we transferred cash of $49.2 million to Archrock during the year ended December 31, 2016. The transfer of cash was recognized as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in our financial statements. As of December 31, 2016, the remaining principal amount due to us from PDVSA Gas in respect of the sale of our and our joint ventures' previously nationalized assets was approximately $37 million.\nPursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, EESLP (in the case of debt offerings) or Exterran Corporation (in the case of equity issuances) will use its commercially reasonable efforts to complete one or more unsecured debt offerings or equity issuances resulting in aggregate gross cash proceeds of at least $250.0 million on the terms described in the Credit Agreement (such transaction, a qualified capital raise\u201d) on or before the maturity date of our term loan facility. In connection with the Spin-off, EESLP contributed to a subsidiary of Archrock the right to receive, promptly following the occurrence of a qualified capital raise, a $25.0 million cash payment.\nUnrestricted Cash. Of our $35.7 million unrestricted cash balance at December 31, 2016, $19.4 million was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have not provided for U.S. federal income taxes on indefinitely (or permanently) reinvested cumulative earnings of approximately $545.5 million generated by our non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016. In the event of a distribution of earnings to the U.S. in the form of dividends, we may be subject to both foreign withholding taxes and U.S. federal income taxes net of allowable foreign tax credits. We do not believe that the cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries has an adverse impact on our liquidity because we expect that the cash we generate in the U.S. and the available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, as well as the repayment of intercompany liabilities from our non-U.S. subsidiaries, will be sufficient to fund the cash needs of our U.S. operations for the foreseeable future.\nDividends. We do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings to support the growth and development of our business. The declaration of any future cash dividends and, if declared, the amount of any such dividends, will be subject to our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, financial covenants, applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant.\nContractual Obligations. The following table summarizes our cash contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018-2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility due November 2020\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan facility due November 2017 (2)\n</td> <td>232,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>232,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt\n</td> <td>351,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>232,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt (3)\n</td> <td>54,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments\n</td> <td>119,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facilities and other operating leases\n</td> <td>27,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>552,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>383,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 10 to the Financial Statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>The principal amount of $232.8 million due in November 2017 under the term loan facility is classified as long-term in our balance sheet at December 31, 2016 because we have the intent and ability to refinance the current principal amount due with borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility.

Related to these unrecognized tax benefits, we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest (including discontinued operations) of $3.0 million.\nIndemnifications. In conjunction with, and effective as of the completion of, the Spin-off, we entered into the separation and distribution agreement with Archrock, which governs, among other things, the treatment between Archrock and us of aspects relating to indemnification, insurance, confidentiality and cooperation. Generally, the separation and distribution agreement provides for cross-indemnities principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business with us and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of Archrock's business with Archrock. Pursuant to the agreement, we and Archrock will generally release the other party from all claims arising prior to the Spin-off that relate to the other party's business, subject to certain exceptions. Additionally, in conjunction with, and effective as of the completion of, the Spin-off, we entered into the tax matters agreement with Archrock. Under the tax matters agreement and subject to certain exceptions, we are generally liable for, and indemnify Archrock against, taxes attributable to our business, and Archrock is generally liable for, and indemnify us against, all taxes attributable to its business. We are generally liable for, and indemnify Archrock against, 50% of certain taxes that are not clearly attributable to our business or Archrock's business. Any payment made by us to Archrock, or by Archrock to us, is treated by all parties for tax purposes as a nontaxable distribution or capital contribution, respectively, made immediately prior to the Spin-off.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nEffects of Inflation\nOur revenues and results of operations have not been materially impacted by inflation in the past three fiscal years.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Practices and Estimates\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and accounting policies, including those related to bad debt, inventories, fixed assets, intangible assets, income taxes, revenue recognition and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of this process form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and these differences can be material to our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We describe our significant accounting policies more fully in Note 2 to our Financial Statements.\nAllowances and Reserves\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The determination of the collectability of amounts due from our customers requires us to use estimates and make judgments regarding future events and trends, including monitoring our customers' payment history and current creditworthiness to determine that collectibility is reasonably assured, as well as consideration of the overall business climate in which our customers operate. Inherently, these uncertainties require us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers' ability to pay amounts due to us in order to determine the appropriate amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts. We review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly. We determine the allowance needed based on historical write-off experience and by evaluating significant balances aged greater than 90 days individually for collectibility. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded bad debt expense of $3.0 million, $3.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately 2% and 1% of our gross accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the lower of cost or market. This requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions and production requirements. These estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential outcomes. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded $0.8 million, $15.6 million and $3.2 million, respectively, in inventory write-downs and reserves for inventory which was obsolete or slow moving. As discussed further in Note 14 to the Financial Statements, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded restructuring and other charges of $8.7 million related to inventory write-downs associated with restructuring activities. Significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventory that may be required. Our reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory was approximately 11% and 10% of our gross raw materials inventory balance at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDepreciation\nProperty, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is computed on the straight-line basis using estimated useful lives and salvage values, including idle assets in our active fleet. The assumptions and judgments we use in determining the estimated useful lives and salvage values of our property, plant and equipment reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future use of our assets. We periodically analyze our estimates of useful lives of our property, plant and equipment to determine if the depreciable periods and salvage value continue to be appropriate. The use of different estimates, assumptions and judgments in the establishment of property, plant and equipment accounting policies, especially those involving their useful lives, would likely result in significantly different net book values of our assets and results of operations. For example, if the useful lives of compressor units in our active fleet with a net book value of approximately $452.9 million were reduced by five years on January 1, 2016, our depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 would have increased by approximately $12 million.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangibles that are being amortized, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, including the removal of compressor units from our active fleet, indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Compressor units in our active fleet that were idle as of December 31, 2016 comprise approximately 202,000 horsepower with a net book value of approximately $73.1 million. The determination that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable requires us to make judgments regarding long-term forecasts of future revenue and costs related to the assets subject to review. Specifically for idle compression units that are removed from the active fleet and that will be sold to third parties as working compression units, significant assumptions include forecasted sale prices based on future market conditions and demand, forecasted cost to maintain the assets until sold and the forecasted length of time necessary to sell the assets. These forecasts are uncertain as they require significant assumptions about future market conditions. Significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period. Given the nature of these evaluations and their application to specific assets and specific times, it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions. An impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. When necessary, an impairment loss is recognized and represents the excess of the asset's carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value and is charged to the period in which the impairment occurred.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax provision, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We operate in approximately 30 countries and, as a result, we and our subsidiaries file consolidated and separate income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in numerous state and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, certain of our operations were historically included in Archrock's consolidated income tax returns in the U.S. federal and state jurisdictions. Our tax provision for periods prior to the Spin-off was determined on a separate return, stand-alone basis. Differences between the separate return method utilized and Archrock's U.S. income tax returns and cash flows attributable to income taxes for our U.S. operations were recognized as distributions to, or contributions from, parent within parent equity. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our consolidated income tax provision.\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future U.S. federal, state and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax-planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income (loss).\nChanges in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations.\nThe accounting standard for income taxes provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is only recognized when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits. In addition, guidance is provided on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We adjust reserves for unrecognized tax benefits when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax provision in the period in which new information is available.\nWe consider the earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S. on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, as well as the repayment of intercompany liabilities from our non-U.S. subsidiaries, will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability related to these unremitted foreign earnings as it is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities. Should we decide to repatriate any unremitted foreign earnings, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that such earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the U.S.\nRevenue Recognition - Percentage-of-Completion Accounting\nWe recognize revenue and profit for our product sales operations as work progresses on long-term contracts using the percentage-of-completion method when the applicable criteria are met. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized approximately 84%, 74% and 73%, respectively, of our total product sales revenues from third parties using the percentage-of-completion method. The percentage-of-completion method depends largely on the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates related to the extent of progress toward completion of the contract, contract revenues and contract costs. Recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. Revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. The typical duration of these projects is three to 24 months. If we determine that a contract will result in a loss, we record a provision for the entire amount of the estimated loss in the period in which such loss is identified. Due to the long-term nature of some of our jobs, developing the estimates of cost often requires significant judgment.\nWe estimate percentage-of-completion for oil and gas compressor and production and processing equipment product sales on a direct labor hour to total labor hour basis. This calculation requires management to estimate the number of total labor hours required for each project and to estimate the profit expected on the project. We estimate percentage-of-completion for Belleli EPC product sales on a cost to total cost basis. The cost to total cost basis requires us to estimate the amount of total costs (labor and materials) required to complete each project. Because we have many product sales projects in process at any given time, we do not believe that materially different results would be achieved if different estimates, assumptions or conditions were used for any single project.\nFactors that must be considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate profit include labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of work to be performed, the impact of change orders, availability of raw materials and the impact of delayed performance. Although we continually strive to accurately estimate our progress toward completion and profitability, adjustments to overall contract revenue and contract costs could be significant in future periods due to several factors including but not limited to, settlement of claims against customers, vendor claims against us, customer change orders, changes in cost estimates, changes in project contingencies and settlement of customer claims against us, such as liquidated damage claims. If the aggregate combined cost estimates for uncompleted contracts that are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method in our product sales businesses had been higher or lower by 5% in 2016, our income before income taxes would have decreased or increased by approximately $27.9 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had realized approximately $33.3 million in estimated earnings on uncompleted oil and gas product sales contracts and $43.7 million in estimated losses on uncompleted Belleli EPC product sales contracts. Estimated accrued loss contract provisions of $28.6 million at December 31, 2016 were recognized but not realized on uncompleted Belleli EPC product sales contracts. Accrued loss contract provisions are included in accrued liabilities in our balance sheets.\nContingencies and Litigation\nWe are substantially self-insured for workers' compensation, employer's liability, property, auto liability, general liability and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per-incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks. Losses up to deductible amounts are estimated and accrued based upon known facts, historical trends and industry averages. We review these estimates quarterly and believe such accruals to be adequate. However, insurance liabilities are difficult to estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the timeliness of reporting of occurrences, ongoing treatment or loss mitigation, general trends in litigation recovery outcomes and the effectiveness of safety and risk management programs. Therefore, if our actual experience differs from the assumptions and estimates used for recording the liabilities, adjustments may be required and would be recorded in the period in which the difference becomes known. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had recorded approximately $1.1 million and $1.5 million, respectively, in insurance claim reserves.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various pending or threatened legal actions. While we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, the accounting standard for contingencies requires management to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. We are required to record (and have recorded) a loss during any period in which we believe a loss contingency is probable and can be reasonably estimated. In making determinations of likely outcomes of pending or threatened legal matters, we consider the evaluation of counsel knowledgeable about each matter.\nWe regularly assess and, if required, establish accruals for income tax as well as non-income-based tax contingencies pursuant to the applicable accounting standards that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where we operate. Tax contingencies are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a quarterly basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the outcome expected by management. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had recorded approximately $24.3 million and $21.1 million, respectively, of accruals for tax contingencies (including penalties and interest and discontinued operations). Of these amounts, $21.2 million and $18.0 million, respectively, are accrued for income taxes as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $3.1 million as of both periods are accrued for non-income-based taxes. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had an indemnification receivable from Archrock related to non-income-based taxes of $1.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively. If our actual experience differs from the assumptions and estimates used for recording the liabilities, adjustments may be required and would be recorded in the period in which the difference becomes known.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the Financial Statements.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of the company's financial condition and results of operations, highlighting its position as a market leader in compression, production, and processing products and services for the oil and natural gas industry. It discusses the spin-off from Archrock, changes in reporting segments, and the exit of certain Belleli businesses.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements, the notes thereto, and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. See Part I ( Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d) and Part I, Item 1A ( Risk Factors\u201d) in this report.\nOverview\nWe are a market leader in the provision of compression, production and processing products and services that support the production and transportation of oil and natural gas throughout the world. We provide these products and services to a global customer base consisting of companies engaged in all aspects of the oil and natural gas industry, including large integrated oil and natural gas companies, national oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas producers and oil and natural gas processors, gatherers and pipeline operators. We operate in four primary business lines: contract operations, aftermarket services, oil and gas product sales and Belleli EPC product sales. In our contract operations business line, we have operations outside of the United States of America ( U.S.\u201d) where we own and operate natural gas compression equipment and crude oil and natural gas production and processing equipment on behalf of our customers. In our aftermarket services business line, we primarily have operations outside of the U.S. where we provide operations, maintenance, overhaul and reconfiguration services to customers who own their own compression, production, processing, treating and related equipment. In our oil and gas product sales business line, we manufacture natural gas compression packages and oil and natural gas production and processing equipment for sale to our customers throughout the world and for use in our contract operations business line. In our Belleli EPC product sales business line that we are exiting, we have historically provided engineering, procurement and construction for the manufacture of tanks for tank farms and the manufacture of evaporators and brine heaters for desalination plants. As of December 31, 2016, we had five significant contracts in this business remaining and currently expect to have substantially exited this business by the first half of 2018. We also offer our customers, on either a contract operations basis or a sale basis, the engineering, design, project management, procurement and construction services necessary to incorporate our products into production, processing and compression facilities, which we refer to as integrated projects.\nAs discussed in Note 22 to the Financial Statements, we changed our reporting segments in the third quarter of 2016 to split our previously disclosed product sales segment into the following two new reportable segments: oil and gas product sales\u201d and Belleli EPC product sales.\u201d The contract operations and aftermarket services segments were not impacted by this change. The change in our reportable segments is reflected in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nSpin-off\nOn November 3, 2015, Archrock, Inc. (named Exterran Holdings, Inc. prior to November 3, 2015) ( Archrock\u201d) completed the spin-off (the Spin-off\u201d) of its international contract operations, international aftermarket services (the international contract operations and international aftermarket services businesses combined are referred to as the international services businesses\u201d and include such activities conducted outside of the U.S.) and global fabrication businesses into an independent, publicly traded company ( Exterran Corporation,\u201d our,\u201d we\u201d or us\u201d). To effect the Spin-off, on November 3, 2015, Archrock distributed, on a pro rata basis, all of our shares of common stock to its stockholders of record as of October 27, 2015 (the Record Date\u201d). Archrock shareholders received one share of Exterran Corporation common stock for every two shares of Archrock common stock held at the close of business on the Record Date. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement with Archrock and certain of our and Archrock's respective affiliates, on November 3, 2015, we transferred cash of $532.6 million to Archrock. Following the completion of the Spin-off, we and Archrock became and continue to be independent, publicly traded companies with separate boards of directors and management.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. All financial information presented for periods after the Spin-off represents our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows (referred to as the consolidated financial statements\u201d) and all financial information for periods prior to the Spin-off represents our combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows (referred to as the combined financial statements\u201d). Accordingly:\n \u2022 Our consolidated and combined statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders' equity for the year ended December 31, 2015 consist of (i) the combined results of Archrock's international services and product sales businesses for the period between January 1, 2015 and November 3, 2015 and (ii) the consolidated results of Exterran Corporation for periods subsequent to November 3, 2015. Our combined statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders' equity for the year ended December 31, 2014 consist entirely of the combined results of Archrock's international services and product sales businesses. \n \u2022 Our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2016 and 2015 consist entirely of our consolidated balances. \nThe combined financial statements were derived from the accounting records of Archrock and reflect the combined historical results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Archrock's international services and product sales businesses. The combined financial statements were presented as if such businesses had been combined for periods prior to November 4, 2015. All intercompany transactions and accounts within these statements have been eliminated. Affiliate transactions between the international services and product sales businesses of Archrock and the other businesses of Archrock have been included in the combined financial statements, with the exception of oil and gas product sales within our wholly owned subsidiary, Exterran Energy Solutions, L.P. ( EESLP\u201d). Prior to the closing of the Spin-off, EESLP also had a fleet of compression units used to provide compression services in the U.S. services business of Archrock. Revenue has not been recognized in the combined statements of operations for the sale of compressor units by us that were used by EESLP to provide compression services to customers of the U.S. services business of Archrock. See Note 16 to the Financial Statements for further discussion on transactions with affiliates.\nThe combined statements of operations for periods prior to the Spin-off include expense allocations for certain functions historically performed by Archrock and not allocated to its operating segments, including allocations of expenses related to executive oversight, accounting, treasury, tax, legal, human resources, procurement and information technology. See Note 16 to the Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the allocation of corporate expenses. Additionally, third party debt of Archrock, other than debt attributable to capital leases, was not allocated to us for any of the periods prior to the Spin-off as we were not the legal obligor of the debt and Archrock's borrowings were not directly attributable to our business.\nWe refer to the consolidated and combined financial statements collectively as financial statements,\u201d and individually as balance sheets,\u201d statements of operations,\u201d statements of comprehensive income (loss),\u201d statements of stockholders' equity\u201d and statements of cash flows\u201d herein.\nExit of our Belleli Businesses\nIn the first quarter of 2016, we began executing a plan to exit certain Belleli businesses to focus on our core oil and gas businesses. Specifically, we began marketing for sale the Belleli CPE business comprising of engineering, procurement and manufacturing services related to the manufacture of critical process equipment for refinery and petrochemical facilities (referred to as Belleli CPE\u201d or the Belleli CPE business\u201d herein). In addition, we began executing our exit of the Belleli EPC business that has historically been comprised of engineering, procurement and construction for the manufacture of tanks for tank farms and the manufacture of evaporators and brine heaters for desalination plants in the Middle East (referred to as Belleli EPC\u201d or the Belleli EPC business\u201d herein). Belleli CPE met the held for sale criteria and is reflected as discontinued operations in our financial statements for all periods presented. In August 2016, we completed the sale of our Belleli CPE business to Tosto S.r.l. for cash proceeds of $5.5 million. Belleli CPE was previously included in our former product sales segment. In conjunction with the planned disposition of Belleli CPE, we recorded impairments of long-lived assets and current assets that totaled $68.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The impairment charges are reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax. In accordance with GAAP, Belleli EPC will be reflected as discontinued operations upon the substantial cessation of the remaining non-oil and gas business. During the first quarter of 2016, we ceased the booking of new orders for our Belleli EPC business. Our plan to exit our Belleli EPC business resulted in a reduction in the remaining useful lives of the assets that are currently used in the Belleli EPC business and a long-lived asset impairment charge of $0.7 million impacting results from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2016. Belleli EPC is represented by our Belleli EPC product sales segment.\nThe following table summarizes the operating results of our core oil and gas businesses and our Belleli businesses (in thousands):\n\n___________________\n (1) See Note 3 to the Financial Statements for further discussion regarding discontinued operations. As Belleli CPE is no longer a part of our continuing operations, Belleli CPE's product sales backlog and third party bookings have been excluded from all periods presented. We completed the sale of Belleli CPE in August 2016. \n (2) During the first quarter of 2016, we ceased the booking of new orders for our Belleli EPC business. Changes in our Belleli EPC backlog since March 31, 2016 reflect revenue recognized and change orders booked on existing contracts. \nIndustry Conditions and Trends\nOur business environment and corresponding operating results are affected by the level of energy industry spending for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. Spending by oil and natural gas exploration and production companies is dependent upon these companies' forecasts regarding the expected future supply, demand and pricing of oil and natural gas products as well as their estimates of risk-adjusted costs to find, develop and produce reserves. Although we believe our contract operations business, and to a lesser extent our oil and gas product sales business, is typically less impacted by commodity prices than certain other energy products and service providers, changes in oil and natural gas exploration and production spending normally result in changes in demand for our products and services.\nNatural gas consumption in the U.S. for the twelve months ended November 30, 2016 decreased by approximately 0.6% compared to the twelve months ended November 30, 2015. The U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA\u201d) forecasts that total U.S. natural gas consumption will increase by 0.4% in 2017 compared to 2016. As reported by the BP Energy Outlook 2017 edition ( BP Energy Outlook 2017\u201d), North American natural gas consumption and worldwide natural gas consumption is expected to grow annually by an average of approximately 1.4% and 1.9%, respectively, per year between 2015 and 2035.\nNatural gas marketed production in the U.S. for the twelve months ended November 30, 2016 decreased by approximately 1.2% compared to the twelve months ended November 30, 2015. The EIA forecasts that total U.S. natural gas marketed production will increase by 2% in 2017 compared to 2016. In addition, according to the BP Energy Outlook 2017, North American natural gas production and worldwide natural gas production is expected to grow annually by an average of approximately 2.4% and 1.8%, respectively, per year between 2015 and 2035.\nGlobal oil and U.S. natural gas prices declined significantly from the third quarter of 2014 through the middle of 2016, which led to declines in U.S. and worldwide capital spending for drilling activity in 2015. Given recent improvements in late 2016 to the market environment, we anticipate industry spending to increase in the U.S. with flat to slight declines in international spending in 2017.\nOur Performance Trends and Outlook\nOur revenue, earnings and financial position are affected by, among other things, market conditions that impact demand and pricing for natural gas compression and oil and natural gas production and processing and our customers' decisions among using our products and services, using our competitors' products and services or owning and operating the equipment themselves.\nDue to a significant decrease in oil and natural gas prices since the third quarter of 2014, overall market activity in North America remained at depressed levels for the majority of 2016. Low commodity prices in 2015 and the majority of 2016 have led to reduced drilling of oil and gas wells in North America. Oil and natural gas prices in North America improved late in 2016 over the lows experienced in the earlier part of the year, however, we believe higher commodity prices for a sustained period are necessary to encourage meaningful increases in customer spending. The Henry Hub spot price for natural gas was $3.71 per MMBtu at December 31, 2016, which was approximately 63% and 18% higher than prices at December 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the U.S. natural gas liquid composite price was approximately $5.45 per MMBtu for the month of November 2016, which was approximately 29% higher and 3% lower than prices for the months of December 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, the West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot price as of December 31, 2016 was approximately 45% and 1% higher than prices at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During periods of lower oil or natural gas prices, our customers typically decrease their capital expenditures, which generally results in lower activity levels. As a result of the low oil and natural gas price environment in North America during 2015 and the majority of 2016, our customers sought to reduce their capital and operating expenditure requirements, and as a result, the demand and pricing for the equipment we manufacture in North America was adversely impacted. Third party booking activity levels for our manufactured oil and gas products in North America during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $343.7 million, which represents a decline of approximately 12% and 68% compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and our North America oil and gas product sales backlog as of December 31, 2016 was $237.7 million, which represents an increase of approximately 6% and a decline of approximately 56% compared to December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We believe these booking levels reflect both our customers' reduced activity levels in response to the decline in commodity prices and caution on the part of our customers as they sought to reduce costs.\nSimilarly, in international markets, lower oil and natural gas prices have had a negative impact on the amount of capital investment by our customers in new projects. Our customers sought to reduce their capital and operating expenditure requirements due to lower oil and natural gas prices. As a result, the demand and pricing for our products and services in international markets was adversely impacted.\nIndustry forecasts indicate a sharp rise in U.S. shale fields spending is expected for 2017 with continued underinvestment in international markets. We believe international spending will recover more slowly than spending in North America, as the largest-in-class energy producers with more international exposure focus on debt reduction and returning cash to shareholders, while smaller, U.S.-centric resource holders invest to increase production in lower-cost shale plays. Demand for our oil and gas product sales in the U.S. could benefit from increased customer spending.\nDespite the anticipated slower recovery internationally, longer-term fundamentals in our international markets depends in part on international oil and gas infrastructure projects, many of which are based on longer-term plans of our customers that can be driven by their local market demand and local pricing for natural gas. As a result, we believe our international customers make decisions based on longer-term fundamentals that can be less tied to near term commodity prices than our North American customers. Therefore, we believe the demand for our products and services in international markets will continue, and we expect to have opportunities to grow our international businesses over the long term. Third party booking activity levels for our manufactured oil and gas products in international markets during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $87.5 million, which represents an increase of approximately 87% and a decline of approximately 76% compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and our international market oil and gas product sales backlog as of December 31, 2016 was $68.5 million, which represents an increase of approximately 57% and a decline of approximately 70% compared to December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The fluctuations in the size of our bid proposals for new contracts tend to create variability in booking activity levels in international markets from period to period.\nAggregate third party booking activity levels for our manufactured oil and gas products in North America and international markets during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $431.2 million, which represents a decline of approximately 1% and 70% compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The aggregate oil and gas product sales backlog for our manufactured products in North America and international markets as of December 31, 2016 was $306.2 million, which represents an increase of approximately 15% and a decline of approximately 60% compared to December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nSince the first quarter of 2016, we have been executing activities necessary to exit the Belleli EPC product sales business. At December 31, 2016, we had five significant contracts in the remaining business and expect to have substantially exited the business by the first half of 2018. Based on contractual requirements, the progress on the projects and the status of negotiations with the related customers, as of December 31, 2016, a liability for estimated penalties for liquidated damages of $18.3 million has been included in our financial statements primarily due to our actual or projected failure to meet certain specified contractual milestone dates. We have asserted claims, or intend to assert claims, and are negotiating change orders, that if settled favorably, could result in recoveries for us, including a release of such claims in exchange for release of liquidated damages.\nThe timing of any change in activity levels by our customers is difficult to predict. As a result, our ability to project the anticipated activity level for our business, and particularly our oil and gas product sales segment, is limited. In the latter part of 2016, we experienced an increase in oil and gas product sales bookings. However, volatility in commodity prices could delay investments by our customers in significant projects, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur level of capital spending depends on our forecast for the demand for our products and services and the equipment required to provide services to our customers. Based on demand we see for contract operations, we anticipate investing more capital in our contract operations business in 2017 than we did in 2016.\nCertain Key Challenges and Uncertainties\nMarket conditions and competition in the oil and natural gas industry and the risks inherent in international markets continue to represent key challenges and uncertainties. In addition to these challenges, we believe the following represent some of the key challenges and uncertainties we will face in the future:\nGlobal Energy Markets and Oil and Natural Gas Pricing. Our results of operations depend upon the level of activity in the global energy markets, including oil and natural gas development, production, processing and transportation. Oil and natural gas prices and the level of drilling and exploration activity can be volatile and have fallen significantly in recent years. As a result, many producers in the U.S. and other parts of the world, including our customers, significantly reduced their capital and operating spending in 2015 and 2016. If oil and natural gas exploration and development activity and the number of well completions continue to decline due to the reduction in oil and natural gas prices or significant instability in energy markets, we would anticipate a continued decrease in demand and pricing for our natural gas compression and oil and natural gas production and processing equipment and services. For example, unfavorable market conditions or financial difficulties experienced by our customers may result in cancellation of contracts or the delay or abandonment of projects, which could cause our cash flows generated by our product sales and international services to decline and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nExecution on Larger Contract Operations and Product Sales Projects. Some of our projects are significant in size and scope, which can translate into more technically challenging conditions or performance specifications for our products and services. Contracts with our customers generally specify delivery dates, performance criteria and penalties for our failure to perform. Any failure to execute such larger projects in a timely and cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMaintaining Expense Levels in Line with Activity Decreases. Given the volatility of the global energy markets and industry capital spending activity levels, we have and will continue to monitor and control our expense levels, including personnel head count and costs, to protect our profitability. Some of these expenses are difficult to reduce, and if we are not able to reduce them commensurate with activity decreases, our profitability will be negatively impacted. Any failure to reduce costs in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSummary of Results\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the Financial Statements, the results from continuing operations for all periods presented exclude the results of our Venezuelan contract operations and Belleli CPE businesses. Those results are reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nRevenue. Revenue during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $1,029.3 million, $1,790.5 million and $2,101.7 million, respectively. The decrease in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily caused by revenue decreases in our oil and gas product and contract operations segments. The decrease in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was caused by revenue decreases in all four of our segments.\nNet income. We generated net loss of $227.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, and net income of $26.6 million and $115.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in net income during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in gross margin in our oil and gas product sales and contract operations segments, non-cash valuation allowances of $119.8 million recorded against U.S. deferred tax assets during 2016, impairment charges reflected in loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $68.8 million related to Belleli CPE during 2016 and increases in interest expense and restatement charges. These activities were partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expense, foreign currency gains of $6.4 million during 2016 compared to foreign currency losses of $35.8 million during 2015, estimated loss contract provisions of $30.1 million recorded on significant Belleli EPC product sales projects during 2015 and a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense. Net loss during the year ended December 31, 2016 included loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $33.6 million and net income during the year ended December 31, 2015 included income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $54.8 million. The decrease in net income during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in gross margin in our oil and gas product sales and contract operations segments, an increase in restructuring and other charges, a $26.5 million increase in translation losses related to the functional currency remeasurement of our foreign subsidiaries' non-functional currency denominated intercompany obligations, an increase in long-lived asset impairment and a $16.0 million decrease in proceeds received from the sale of our Venezuelan subsidiary's assets to PDVSA Gas S.A. ( PDVSA Gas\u201d). These activities were partially offset by decreases in SG&A expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense. Net income during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 included income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $54.8 million and $67.2 million, respectively.\nEBITDA, as adjusted. Our EBITDA, as adjusted, was $145.1 million, $240.6 million and $293.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. EBITDA, as adjusted, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased primarily due to a decrease in gross margin in our oil and gas product sales and contract operations segments, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expense and estimated loss contract provisions of $30.1 million recorded on significant Belleli EPC product sales projects during 2015. EBITDA, as adjusted, during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased primarily due to a decrease in gross margin in our oil and gas product sales and contract operations segments, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expense. For a reconciliation of EBITDA, as adjusted, to net income (loss), its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read Part II, Item 6 ( Selected Financial Data - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d) of this report.\nResults by Business Segment. The following table summarizes revenue, gross margin and gross margin percentages for each of our business segments (dollars in thousands):\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements, the notes thereto, and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. See Part I ( Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d) and Part I, Item 1A ( Risk Factors\u201d) in this report.\nOverview\nWe are a market leader in the provision of compression, production and processing products and services that support the production and transportation of oil and natural gas throughout the world. We provide these products and services to a global customer base consisting of companies engaged in all aspects of the oil and natural gas industry, including large integrated oil and natural gas companies, national oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas producers and oil and natural gas processors, gatherers and pipeline operators. We operate in four primary business lines: contract operations, aftermarket services, oil and gas product sales and Belleli EPC product sales. In our contract operations business line, we have operations outside of the United States of America ( U.S.\u201d) where we own and operate natural gas compression equipment and crude oil and natural gas production and processing equipment on behalf of our customers. In our aftermarket services business line, we primarily have operations outside of the U.S. where we provide operations, maintenance, overhaul and reconfiguration services to customers who own their own compression, production, processing, treating and related equipment. In our oil and gas product sales business line, we manufacture natural gas compression packages and oil and natural gas production and processing equipment for sale to our customers throughout the world and for use in our contract operations business line. In our Belleli EPC product sales business line that we are exiting, we have historically provided engineering, procurement and construction for the manufacture of tanks for tank farms and the manufacture of evaporators and brine heaters for desalination plants. As of December 31, 2016, we had five significant contracts in this business remaining and currently expect to have substantially exited this business by the first half of 2018. We also offer our customers, on either a contract operations basis or a sale basis, the engineering, design, project management, procurement and construction services necessary to incorporate our products into production, processing and compression facilities, which we refer to as integrated projects.\nAs discussed in Note 22 to the Financial Statements, we changed our reporting segments in the third quarter of 2016 to split our previously disclosed product sales segment into the following two new reportable segments: oil and gas product sales\u201d and Belleli EPC product sales.\u201d The contract operations and aftermarket services segments were not impacted by this change. The change in our reportable segments is reflected in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nSpin-off\nOn November 3, 2015, Archrock, Inc. (named Exterran Holdings, Inc. prior to November 3, 2015) ( Archrock\u201d) completed the spin-off (the Spin-off\u201d) of its international contract operations, international aftermarket services (the international contract operations and international aftermarket services businesses combined are referred to as the international services businesses\u201d and include such activities conducted outside of the U.S.) and global fabrication businesses into an independent, publicly traded company ( Exterran Corporation,\u201d our,\u201d we\u201d or us\u201d). To effect the Spin-off, on November 3, 2015, Archrock distributed, on a pro rata basis, all of our shares of common stock to its stockholders of record as of October 27, 2015 (the Record Date\u201d). Archrock shareholders received one share of Exterran Corporation common stock for every two shares of Archrock common stock held at the close of business on the Record Date. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement with Archrock and certain of our and Archrock's respective affiliates, on November 3, 2015, we transferred cash of $532.6 million to Archrock. Following the completion of the Spin-off, we and Archrock became and continue to be independent, publicly traded companies with separate boards of directors and management.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. All financial information presented for periods after the Spin-off represents our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows (referred to as the consolidated financial statements\u201d) and all financial information for periods prior to the Spin-off represents our combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows (referred to as the combined financial statements\u201d). Accordingly:\n \u2022 Our consolidated and combined statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders' equity for the year ended December 31, 2015 consist of (i) the combined results of Archrock's international services and product sales businesses for the period between January 1, 2015 and November 3, 2015 and (ii) the consolidated results of Exterran Corporation for periods subsequent to November 3, 2015. Our combined statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders' equity for the year ended December 31, 2014 consist entirely of the combined results of Archrock's international services and product sales businesses. \n \u2022 Our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2016 and 2015 consist entirely of our consolidated balances. \nThe combined financial statements were derived from the accounting records of Archrock and reflect the combined historical results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Archrock's international services and product sales businesses. The combined financial statements were presented as if such businesses had been combined for periods prior to November 4, 2015. All intercompany transactions and accounts within these statements have been eliminated. Affiliate transactions between the international services and product sales businesses of Archrock and the other businesses of Archrock have been included in the combined financial statements, with the exception of oil and gas product sales within our wholly owned subsidiary, Exterran Energy Solutions, L.P. ( EESLP\u201d). Prior to the closing of the Spin-off, EESLP also had a fleet of compression units used to provide compression services in the U.S. services business of Archrock. Revenue has not been recognized in the combined statements of operations for the sale of compressor units by us that were used by EESLP to provide compression services to customers of the U.S. services business of Archrock. See Note 16 to the Financial Statements for further discussion on transactions with affiliates.\nThe combined statements of operations for periods prior to the Spin-off include expense allocations for certain functions historically performed by Archrock and not allocated to its operating segments, including allocations of expenses related to executive oversight, accounting, treasury, tax, legal, human resources, procurement and information technology. See Note 16 to the Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the allocation of corporate expenses. Additionally, third party debt of Archrock, other than debt attributable to capital leases, was not allocated to us for any of the periods prior to the Spin-off as we were not the legal obligor of the debt and Archrock's borrowings were not directly attributable to our business.\nWe refer to the consolidated and combined financial statements collectively as financial statements,\u201d and individually as balance sheets,\u201d statements of operations,\u201d statements of comprehensive income (loss),\u201d statements of stockholders' equity\u201d and statements of cash flows\u201d herein.\nExit of our Belleli Businesses\nIn the first quarter of 2016, we began executing a plan to exit certain Belleli businesses to focus on our core oil and gas businesses. Specifically, we began marketing for sale the Belleli CPE business comprising of engineering, procurement and manufacturing services related to the manufacture of critical process equipment for refinery and petrochemical facilities (referred to as Belleli CPE\u201d or the Belleli CPE business\u201d herein). In addition, we began executing our exit of the Belleli EPC business that has historically been comprised of engineering, procurement and construction for the manufacture of tanks for tank farms and the manufacture of evaporators and brine heaters for desalination plants in the Middle East (referred to as Belleli EPC\u201d or the Belleli EPC business\u201d herein). Belleli CPE met the held for sale criteria and is reflected as discontinued operations in our financial statements for all periods presented. In August 2016, we completed the sale of our Belleli CPE business to Tosto S.r.l. for cash proceeds of $5.5 million. Belleli CPE was previously included in our former product sales segment. In conjunction with the planned disposition of Belleli CPE, we recorded impairments of long-lived assets and current assets that totaled $68.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The impairment charges are reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax. In accordance with GAAP, Belleli EPC will be reflected as discontinued operations upon the substantial cessation of the remaining non-oil and gas business. During the first quarter of 2016, we ceased the booking of new orders for our Belleli EPC business. Our plan to exit our Belleli EPC business resulted in a reduction in the remaining useful lives of the assets that are currently used in the Belleli EPC business and a long-lived asset impairment charge of $0.7 million impacting results from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2016. Belleli EPC is represented by our Belleli EPC product sales segment.\nThe following table summarizes the operating results of our core oil and gas businesses and our Belleli businesses (in thousands):\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

discussion regarding discontinued operations. As Belleli CPE is no longer a part of our continuing operations, Belleli CPE's product sales backlog and third party bookings have been excluded from all periods presented. We completed the sale of Belleli CPE in August 2016. \n (2) During the first quarter of 2016, we ceased the booking of new orders for our Belleli EPC business. Changes in our Belleli EPC backlog since March 31, 2016 reflect revenue recognized and change orders booked on existing contracts. \nIndustry Conditions and Trends\nOur business environment and corresponding operating results are affected by the level of energy industry spending for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. Spending by oil and natural gas exploration and production companies is dependent upon these companies' forecasts regarding the expected future supply, demand and pricing of oil and natural gas products as well as their estimates of risk-adjusted costs to find, develop and produce reserves. Although we believe our contract operations business, and to a lesser extent our oil and gas product sales business, is typically less impacted by commodity prices than certain other energy products and service providers, changes in oil and natural gas exploration and production spending normally result in changes in demand for our products and services.\nNatural gas consumption in the U.S. for the twelve months ended November 30, 2016 decreased by approximately 0.6% compared to the twelve months ended November 30, 2015. The U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA\u201d) forecasts that total U.S. natural gas consumption will increase by 0.4% in 2017 compared to 2016. As reported by the BP Energy Outlook 2017 edition ( BP Energy Outlook 2017\u201d), North American natural gas consumption and worldwide natural gas consumption is expected to grow annually by an average of approximately 1.4% and 1.9%, respectively, per year between 2015 and 2035.\nNatural gas marketed production in the U.S. for the twelve months ended November 30, 2016 decreased by approximately 1.2% compared to the twelve months ended November 30, 2015. The EIA forecasts that total U.S. natural gas marketed production will increase by 2% in 2017 compared to 2016. In addition, according to the BP Energy Outlook 2017, North American natural gas production and worldwide natural gas production is expected to grow annually by an average of approximately 2.4% and 1.8%, respectively, per year between 2015 and 2035.\nGlobal oil and U.S. natural gas prices declined significantly from the third quarter of 2014 through the middle of 2016, which led to declines in U.S. and worldwide capital spending for drilling activity in 2015. Given recent improvements in late 2016 to the market environment, we anticipate industry spending to increase in the U.S. with flat to slight declines in international spending in 2017.\nOur Performance Trends and Outlook\nOur revenue, earnings and financial position are affected by, among other things, market conditions that impact demand and pricing for natural gas compression and oil and natural gas production and processing and our customers' decisions among using our products and services, using our competitors' products and services or owning and operating the equipment themselves.\nDue to a significant decrease in oil and natural gas prices since the third quarter of 2014, overall market activity in North America remained at depressed levels for the majority of 2016. Low commodity prices in 2015 and the majority of 2016 have led to reduced drilling of oil and gas wells in North America. Oil and natural gas prices in North America improved late in 2016 over the lows experienced in the earlier part of the year, however, we believe higher commodity prices for a sustained period are necessary to encourage meaningful increases in customer spending. The Henry Hub spot price for natural gas was $3.71 per MMBtu at December 31, 2016, which was approximately 63% and 18% higher than prices at December 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the U.S. natural gas liquid composite price was approximately $5.45 per MMBtu for the month of November 2016, which was approximately 29% higher and 3% lower than prices for the months of December 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, the West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot price as of December 31, 2016 was approximately 45% and 1% higher than prices at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During periods of lower oil or natural gas prices, our customers typically decrease their capital expenditures, which generally results in lower activity levels. As a result of the low oil and natural gas price environment in North America during 2015 and the majority of 2016, our customers sought to reduce their capital and operating expenditure requirements, and as a result, the demand and pricing for the equipment we manufacture in North America was adversely impacted. Third party booking activity levels for our manufactured oil and gas products in North America during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $343.7 million, which represents a decline of approximately 12% and 68% compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and our North America oil and gas product sales backlog as of December 31, 2016 was $237.7 million, which represents an increase of approximately 6% and a decline of approximately 56% compared to December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We believe these booking levels reflect both our customers' reduced activity levels in response to the decline in commodity prices and caution on the part of our customers as they sought to reduce costs.\nSimilarly, in international markets, lower oil and natural gas prices have had a negative impact on the amount of capital investment by our customers in new projects. Our customers sought to reduce their capital and operating expenditure requirements due to lower oil and natural gas prices. As a result, the demand and pricing for our products and services in international markets was adversely impacted.\nIndustry forecasts indicate a sharp rise in U.S. shale fields spending is expected for 2017 with continued underinvestment in international markets. We believe international spending will recover more slowly than spending in North America, as the largest-in-class energy producers with more international exposure focus on debt reduction and returning cash to shareholders, while smaller, U.S.-centric resource holders invest to increase production in lower-cost shale plays. Demand for our oil and gas product sales in the U.S. could benefit from increased customer spending.\nDespite the anticipated slower recovery internationally, longer-term fundamentals in our international markets depends in part on international oil and gas infrastructure projects, many of which are based on longer-term plans of our customers that can be driven by their local market demand and local pricing for natural gas. As a result, we believe our international customers make decisions based on longer-term fundamentals that can be less tied to near term commodity prices than our North American customers. Therefore, we believe the demand for our products and services in international markets will continue, and we expect to have opportunities to grow our international businesses over the long term. Third party booking activity levels for our manufactured oil and gas products in international markets during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $87.5 million, which represents an increase of approximately 87% and a decline of approximately 76% compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and our international market oil and gas product sales backlog as of December 31, 2016 was $68.5 million, which represents an increase of approximately 57% and a decline of approximately 70% compared to December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The fluctuations in the size of our bid proposals for new contracts tend to create variability in booking activity levels in international markets from period to period.\nAggregate third party booking activity levels for our manufactured oil and gas products in North America and international markets during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $431.2 million, which represents a decline of approximately 1% and 70% compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The aggregate oil and gas product sales backlog for our manufactured products in North America and international markets as of December 31, 2016 was $306.2 million, which represents an increase of approximately 15% and a decline of approximately 60% compared to December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nSince the first quarter of 2016, we have been executing activities necessary to exit the Belleli EPC product sales business. At December 31, 2016, we had five significant contracts in the remaining business and expect to have substantially exited the business by the first half of 2018. Based on contractual requirements, the progress on the projects and the status of negotiations with the related customers, as of December 31, 2016, a liability for estimated penalties for liquidated damages of $18.3 million has been included in our financial statements primarily due to our actual or projected failure to meet certain specified contractual milestone dates. We have asserted claims, or intend to assert claims, and are negotiating change orders, that if settled favorably, could result in recoveries for us, including a release of such claims in exchange for release of liquidated damages.\nThe timing of any change in activity levels by our customers is difficult to predict. As a result, our ability to project the anticipated activity level for our business, and particularly our oil and gas product sales segment, is limited. In the latter part of 2016, we experienced an increase in oil and gas product sales bookings. However, volatility in commodity prices could delay investments by our customers in significant projects, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur level of capital spending depends on our forecast for the demand for our products and services and the equipment required to provide services to our customers. Based on demand we see for contract operations, we anticipate investing more capital in our contract operations business in 2017 than we did in 2016.\nCertain Key Challenges and Uncertainties\nMarket conditions and competition in the oil and natural gas industry and the risks inherent in international markets continue to represent key challenges and uncertainties. In addition to these challenges, we believe the following represent some of the key challenges and uncertainties we will face in the future:\nGlobal Energy Markets and Oil and Natural Gas Pricing. Our results of operations depend upon the level of activity in the global energy markets, including oil and natural gas development, production, processing and transportation. Oil and natural gas prices and the level of drilling and exploration activity can be volatile and have fallen significantly in recent years. As a result, many producers in the U.S. and other parts of the world, including our customers, significantly reduced their capital and operating spending in 2015 and 2016. If oil and natural gas exploration and development activity and the number of well completions continue to decline due to the reduction in oil and natural gas prices or significant instability in energy markets, we would anticipate a continued decrease in demand and pricing for our natural gas compression and oil and natural gas production and processing equipment and services. For example, unfavorable market conditions or financial difficulties experienced by our customers may result in cancellation of contracts or the delay or abandonment of projects, which could cause our cash flows generated by our product sales and international services to decline and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nExecution on Larger Contract Operations and Product Sales Projects. Some of our projects are significant in size and scope, which can translate into more technically challenging conditions or performance specifications for our products and services. Contracts with our customers generally specify delivery dates, performance criteria and penalties for our failure to perform. Any failure to execute such larger projects in a timely and cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMaintaining Expense Levels in Line with Activity Decreases. Given the volatility of the global energy markets and industry capital spending activity levels, we have and will continue to monitor and control our expense levels, including personnel head count and costs, to protect our profitability. Some of these expenses are difficult to reduce, and if we are not able to reduce them commensurate with activity decreases, our profitability will be negatively impacted. Any failure to reduce costs in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSummary of Results\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the Financial Statements, the results from continuing operations for all periods presented exclude the results of our Venezuelan contract operations and Belleli CPE businesses. Those results are reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nRevenue. Revenue during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $1,029.3 million, $1,790.5 million and $2,101.7 million, respectively. The decrease in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily caused by revenue decreases in our oil and gas product and contract operations segments. The decrease in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was caused by revenue decreases in all four of our segments.\nNet income. We generated net loss of $227.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, and net income of $26.6 million and $115.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in net income during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in gross margin in our oil and gas product sales and contract operations segments, non-cash valuation allowances of $119.8 million recorded against U.S. deferred tax assets during 2016, impairment charges reflected in loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $68.8 million related to Belleli CPE during 2016 and increases in interest expense and restatement charges. These activities were partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expense, foreign currency gains of $6.4 million during 2016 compared to foreign currency losses of $35.8 million during 2015, estimated loss contract provisions of $30.1 million recorded on significant Belleli EPC product sales projects during 2015 and a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense. Net loss during the year ended December 31, 2016 included loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $33.6 million and net income during the year ended December 31, 2015 included income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $54.8 million. The decrease in net income during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in gross margin in our oil and gas product sales and contract operations segments, an increase in restructuring and other charges, a $26.5 million increase in translation losses related to the functional currency remeasurement of our foreign subsidiaries' non-functional currency denominated intercompany obligations, an increase in long-lived asset impairment and a $16.0 million decrease in proceeds received from the sale of our Venezuelan subsidiary's assets to PDVSA Gas S.A. ( PDVSA Gas\u201d). These activities were partially offset by decreases in SG&A expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense. Net income during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 included income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $54.8 million and $67.2 million, respectively.\nEBITDA, as adjusted. Our EBITDA, as adjusted, was $145.1 million, $240.6 million and $293.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. EBITDA, as adjusted, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased primarily due to a decrease in gross margin in our oil and gas product sales and contract operations segments, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expense and estimated loss contract provisions of $30.1 million recorded on significant Belleli EPC product sales projects during 2015. EBITDA, as adjusted, during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased primarily due to a decrease in gross margin in our oil and gas product sales and contract operations segments, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expense. For a reconciliation of EBITDA, as adjusted, to net income (loss), its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read Part II, Item 6 ( Selected Financial Data - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d) of this report.\nResults by Business Segment.
