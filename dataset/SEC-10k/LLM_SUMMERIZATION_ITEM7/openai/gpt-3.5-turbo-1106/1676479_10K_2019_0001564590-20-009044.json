    "item_7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is a discussion of our financial condition and our results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing under the caption Part II., Item 8 - Financial Statements, Supplementary Data and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d in this Report. The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements, the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements and the other financial information included elsewhere in this Report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Report. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements except to the extent required by applicable law.\nThe following discussion and analysis pertains to our historical results on a consolidated basis. However, because we conduct all of our material business operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, CapStar Bank, the following discussion and analysis relates to activities primarily conducted at the subsidiary level.\nAll dollar amounts in the tables in this section are in thousands of dollars, except per share data or when otherwise specifically noted. Unless specifically noted in this Report, all references in this section to the fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 mean our fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.\nOverview\nWe completed 2019 with net income of $22.4 million, or $1.20 diluted net income per share, compared to net income of $9.7 million, or $0.67 diluted net income per share, for 2018. Average loans for 2019 were $1.45 billion, a 27.9% increase over 2018, and average deposits for 2019 were $1.67 billion, a 34.2% increase over 2018. The comparability of our financial condition and performance has been impacted by our acquisition of Athens which we completed in 2018 and the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, in each case as discussed below.\nWe acquired Athens on October 1, 2018. On the acquisition date, the fair market value of Athens' net assets was $61.6 million, including $344.8 million in loans and $404.5 million in deposits. Net income for 2018 was reduced by $9.8 million of pretax merger related charges related to this acquisition. The Athens acquisition further expanded our franchise into the East Tennessee market.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. Among other items, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of such decrease, we recognized an increase in income tax expense of $3.56 million in 2017 resulting from the revaluation of our deferred tax assets.\nOur primary revenue source is net interest income and fees from various financial services provided to customers. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets less interest expense on deposit accounts and other interest bearing liabilities. Loan volume and interest rates earned on those loans are critical to our overall profitability. Similarly, deposit volume is crucial to funding loans and the rates paid on deposits directly impact our profitability. Business volumes are influenced by competition, new business acquisition efforts and economic factors including market interest rates, business spending and consumer confidence.\nNet interest income increased $16.0 million, or 31.1%, to $67.7 million for 2019 compared to $51.7 million for 2018. The positive effects of increased volumes and yields on earning assets were partially offset by the negative effects of increasing deposit costs. Net interest margin increased to 3.64% for 2019, compared with 3.55% for 2018.\nProvision for loan losses was $0.8 million in 2019 compared to $2.8 million in 2018, a 73.2% decrease. This decrease was primarily the result of lower charge-offs, which were $0.8 million in 2019 compared to $5.0 million in 2018. The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for loan losses that, in management's evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for the estimated probable inherent losses on outstanding loans. Our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 was 0.89% of total loans, compared with 0.85% of total loans at December 31, 2018.\nTotal noninterest income for 2019 increased $8.8 million, or 57.0%, to $24.3 million compared to $15.5 million for 2018, and comprised 21.0% of total revenues.\nTotal noninterest expense for 2019 increased $8.5 million, or 15.9%, to $62.0 million compared to $53.5 million for 2018. Our efficiency ratio for 2019 was 67.4% compared to 79.7% for 2018. The significant decrease in efficiency ratio for 2019 is primarily attributable to $9.8 million of merger related charges included in noninterest expense for 2018, compared to just $2.7 million in 2019.\nThe Company's effective tax rate increased to 23.4% for 2019 from 10.8% for 2018. The higher effective tax rate in 2019 compared to 2018 is mainly the result of the nontaxable life insurance death benefit proceeds received in 2018 as well as a larger amount of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation in 2018.\nTangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, is a measure of a company's capital which is useful in evaluating the quality and adequacy of capital. Our ratio of tangible common equity to total tangible assets was 11.47% as of December 31, 2019, compared with 10.39% at December 31, 2018. See -Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a discussion of and reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\nThe following sections provide more details on subjects presented in this overview.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, which are contained elsewhere in this Report. Certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may materially and adversely affect our reported results and financial position for the current period or future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are either based on quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have identified the following accounting policies and estimates that, due to the difficult, subjective or complex judgments and assumptions inherent in those policies and estimates and the potential sensitivity of our financial statements to those judgments and assumptions, are critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. We believe that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable and appropriate.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nWe record estimated probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio as an allowance for loan losses. The methodologies and assumptions for determining the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan losses involve significant judgments to be made by management. Some of the more critical judgments supporting our allowance for loan losses include judgments about the credit-worthiness of borrowers, estimated value of underlying collateral, assumptions about cash flow, determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses, and the impact of current events, conditions, and other factors impacting the level of inherent losses. Under different conditions or using different assumptions, the actual or estimated credit losses ultimately realized by us may be different from our estimates. In determining the allowance, we estimate losses on individual impaired loans and on groups of loans that are not impaired, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably estimated. On a quarterly basis, we assess the risk inherent in our loan portfolio based on qualitative and quantitative trends in the portfolio, including the internal risk classification of loans, historical loss rates, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, industry or borrower concentrations, delinquency trends, detailed reviews of significant loans with identified weaknesses, and the impacts of local, regional, and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Based on this analysis, we may record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels. For a more complete discussion of the methodology employed to calculate the allowance for loan losses, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, which is included elsewhere in this Report.\nInvestment Securities Impairment\nWe assess on a quarterly basis whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security with respect to which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In any instance, we would consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the impairment, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, and, for debt securities, external credit ratings and recent downgrades. Securities with respect to which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed using the asset and liability method, which recognizes a liability or asset representing the tax effects, based on current tax law, of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events recognized in the financial statements. A valuation allowance may be established to the extent necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to a level at which it is more likely than not\u201d that the tax asset or benefit will be realized. Realization of tax benefits depends on having sufficient taxable income, available tax loss carrybacks or credits, the reversal of taxable temporary differences and/or tax planning strategies within the reversal period, and that current tax law allows for the realization of recorded tax benefits.\nBusiness Combinations\nAssets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of purchased assets or assumed liabilities. When the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the loans are considered impaired, and the expected cash flows in excess of the amount paid are recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan. The excess of the loan's contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded. We must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield which will have a positive impact on interest income. Purchased loans without evidence of credit deterioration are recorded at their initial fair value and adjusted as necessary for subsequent advances, pay downs, amortization or accretion of any premium or discount on purchase, charge-offs and additional provisions that may be required.\nResults of Operations\nThe following is a summary of our results of operations:\nTable 109: <table> <tr>

significant factors affecting our operating results.\nNet Interest Income\nThe largest component of our net income is net interest income - the difference between the income earned on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets and interest expense on deposit accounts and other interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income calculated on a tax-equivalent bais divided by total average interest-earning assets represents our net interest margin. The major factors that affect net interest income and net interest margin are changes in volumes, the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Our margin can also be affected by economic conditions, the competitive environment, loan demand and deposit flow. Our ability to respond to changes in these factors by using effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and our net interest income.\nThe following table sets forth the amount of our average balances, interest income or interest expense for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the average interest rate for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 110:

loan volumes and interest rates rising at a faster pace than interest bearing liabilities. Our net interest margin was 3.64% and 3.55% for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nFor 2019 and 2018, average loan yields increased from 5.11% to 5.41% which was primarily driven by increases in short-term interest rate indexes affecting the variable rate portion of our loan portfolio, offset by competitive pricing pressures, as well as realizing a full year of additional interest income related to the acquisition of Athens, including additional interest income as a result of accretable yield. The full year average LIBOR - 1 month interest rate increased from 2.02% in 2018 to 2.23% in 2019. Similarly, the full year average Bank Prime Loan Rate increased from 4.90% in 2018 to 5.28% in 2019. Approximately 55% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 was variable in nature, a significant portion of which is indexed to 1 month LIBOR and the Bank Prime Loan Rate.\nAverage loans for 2019 increased 27.9% compared to 2018 as a result of the Athens acquisition, adding new bankers in the Nashville MSA and continued focus on attracting new clients.\nAverage security yields increased from 2.94% to 3.14% for 2018 and 2019, respectively, primarily due to increases in the LIBOR rate on the variable rate portion of our securities portfolio. The resulting yield on average interest-earning assets increased 27 basis points for 2019 compared to 2018.\nWe funded our growth in loans through an increase in funding sources of 27.9% from 2018 to 2019. The primary driver of our increased funding sources was growth in our deposits of 34.2% from 2018 to 2019 which was largely driven by the Athens acquisition. Average non-interest bearing deposits increased 20.1% from 2018 to 2019.\nThe average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 1.69% for 2019 compared to 1.49% for 2018. The majority of this increase was due to increases in the Fed Funds rate. The full year average Fed Funds rate increased from 1.83% in 2018 to 2.16% in 2019.\n2018 compared to 2017\nOur net interest income increased $9.8 million, or 23.5%, from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to increasing loan volumes and interest rates rising at a faster pace than interest bearing liabilities. Our net interest margin was 3.55% and 3.25% for 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nFor 2018 and 2017, average loan yields increased from 4.41% to 5.11% which was primarily driven by increases in short-term interest rate indexes affecting the variable rate portion of our loan portfolio, offset by competitive pricing pressures. From December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, the LIBOR - 1 month interest rate increased from 1.56% to 2.50%. Approximately 58% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 was variable in nature and indexed to 1 month LIBOR.\nAverage loans for 2018 increased 14.9% compared to 2017 as a result of the Athens acquisition, adding new bankers in the Nashville MSA and continued focus on attracting new clients.\nAverage security yields increased from 2.74% to 2.94% for 2017 and 2018, respectively, primarily due to increases in the LIBOR rate on the variable rate portion of our securities portfolio. The resulting yield on average interest-earning assets increased 66 basis points for 2018 compared to 2017.\nWe funded our growth in loans through an increase in funding sources of 11.5% from 2017 to 2018. The primary driver of our increased funding sources was growth in our deposits of 12.4% from 2017 to 2018 which was largely driven by the Athens acquisition. Average non-interest bearing deposits increased 12.7% from 2017 to 2018.\nThe average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 1.49% for 2018 compared to 0.99% for 2017. The majority of this increase was due to increases in the Fed Funds rate. The Fed Funds rate increased from 1.33% at December 31, 2017 to 2.40% at December 31, 2018. We passed along 50 basis points of the rate increase to our clients.\nProvision for Loan losses\nOur policy is to maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is a charge to earnings, and is decreased by charge-offs and increased by loan recoveries. Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.89%, 0.85% and 1.45% at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n2019 compared to 2018\nThe provision for loan losses amounted to $0.8 million and $2.8 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. Provision expense is impacted by the absolute level of loans, loan growth, the credit quality of the loan portfolio and the amount of net charge-offs.\nProvision expense decreased for 2019 compared to 2018 due to decreased charge-offs. Charge-offs for 2019 were $0.8 million compared to $5.0 million for 2018. Of the $5.0 million in charge offs during 2018, $4.6 million was attributable to a single borrower.\nOur allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased from 0.85% at December 31, 2018 to 0.89% at December 31, 2019. This increase was largely due to our assessment of risk generally related to macro-economic, geo-political conditions and asset quality. In addition, during 2019, we increased the look-back period, from which we calculate peer bank historical loss experience, from 37 to 41 quarters. Our look-back period is utilized to calculate peer historical loss experience, adjusted for current factors, to comprise the general component of the allowance for loan losses. In the current economic environment, management believes the extension of the look-back period is necessary in order to capture sufficient loss observations to develop a reliable loss estimate of credit losses. The extension of the historical look-back period to capture the historical loss experience of peer banks was applied to all classes and segments of our loan portfolio.\nBased upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, we believe the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb our estimate of probable losses existing in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses, as well as the resultant provision for loan losses charged to operations, are considered adequate by management, they are necessarily approximate and imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, local real estate markets, or particular industry or borrower-specific conditions, which may materially and negatively impact our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and, thus, the resulting provision for loan losses.\n2018 compared to 2017\nThe provision for loan losses amounted to $2.8 million and $12.9 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nProvision expense decreased for 2018 compared to 2017 due to decreased charge-offs. Charge-offs for 2018 were $5.0 million compared to $12.8 million for 2017. In particular, during the second quarter of 2017, we charged-off the loans associated with one specific borrower as credit quality deteriorated and issues emerged which undermined our assessment that an expedient and positive outcome was possible. This particular charge-off, net of recoveries, amounted to $9.1 million in the aggregate. These loans experienced weakness due to the borrower's declining financial condition, which led to falling values of the collateral securing these loans. Our primary collateral for these loans was the enterprise value of the borrower as determined by an Asset Purchase Agreement that was subsequently withdrawn. As the financial condition of the borrower deteriorated, ultimate repayment became increasingly difficult. We determined that timely repayment of these loans was unlikely and charged-off the loans.\nOur allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased from 1.45% at December 31, 2017 to 0.85% at December 31, 2018. This decrease was largely due to the acquired Athens loan portfolio which was accounted for at its fair value as of the acquisition date. A preliminary fair value discount of $4.8 million was applied to the Athens loan portfolio. In addition, during 2018, we increased the look-back period, from which we calculate peer bank historical loss experience, from 33 to 37 quarters.\nNoninterest Income\nIn addition to net interest income, we generate recurring noninterest income. Our banking operations generate revenue from service charges and fees on deposit accounts. We have mortgage banking activities that generates revenue from originating and selling mortgages, the origination and sale of commercial real estate loans, and we have a revenue-sharing relationship with a registered broker-dealer, which generates wealth management fees. In addition to these types of recurring noninterest income, we own insurance on several key employees and record income on the increase in the cash surrender value of these policies.\nThe following table sets forth the principal components of noninterest income for the periods indicated.\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019-2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018-2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Treasury management and other deposit service charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net gain (loss) on sale of securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (99\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3400.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (66\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (104.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tri-Net fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage banking income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other noninterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 177.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2019 compared to 2018\nThe increase in treasury management and other deposit service charges for 2019 was driven primarily by the incremental increase in transaction volume related to our acquisition of Athens, as well as growth in the volume of our commercial and consumer deposit accounts.\nTri-Net fees, implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016, is derived from the origination and sale of commercial real estate loans to third-party investors. All of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. The volume of loan sales has increased through continued to growth and development.\nMortgage banking income consists of mortgage fee income from the origination and sale of mortgage loans. These mortgage fees are for loans originated in our markets that are subsequently sold to third-party investors. Mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as the rate environment changes. Mortgage banking income increased 67.5% from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to a significantly higher volume of originations. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2019, we implemented a hedging program for residential mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell. In connection with this program, we elected the fair value option for this portfolio. The fair value adjustments for applicable loans held for sale and related derivative instruments at December 31, 2019 resulted in a $1.1 million increase to mortgage banking income for 2019 when compared to 2018.\nOther noninterest income primarily consists of loan related fees, interchange income and wealth management income. The increase of $2.8 million from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to organic growth and our acquisition of Athens.\n2018 compared to 2017\nThe increase in treasury management and other deposit service charges for 2018 and 2017 was driven primarily our acquisition of Athens and by transaction volume, which can fluctuate throughout and from year to year. Growth in the volume of our commercial and consumer deposit accounts was the primary contributor to the increase.\nTri-Net fees has steadily increased since it was implemented.\nMortgage banking income decreased 9.4% from 2017 to 2018 due to a lower volume of originations.\nThe increase in other noninterest income of $3.9 million from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to $2.0 million in non-taxable life insurance death benefit proceeds recognized in 2018 and our acquisition of Athens.\nNoninterest Expense\nOur total noninterest expense increase reflects expenses that we have incurred as we build the foundation to support our recent growth and enable us to execute our growth strategy. The following table presents the primary components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated.\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019-2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018-2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data processing and software\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Regulatory fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (42.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Merger related expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 255.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 868.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2019 compared to 2018\nThe increase in salaries and employee benefits was driven primarily by the incremental increase in compensation costs related to our acquisition of Athens and 2019 being the first full year of Athens' related compensation costs being recognized. At December 31, 2019, our associate base had slightly decreased to 289 compared to 295 at December 31, 2018.\nData processing and software expense increased from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to an increase in the volume of transactions from organic growth, costs associated with running dual systems related to our acquisition of Athens and insourcing certain IT related functions. The Athens related systems conversion was successfully completed during the second quarter of 2019.\nThe increase in occupancy and equipment expense from 2018 to 2019 was largely attributable to increased depreciation and other facilities related expenses associated with our acquisition of Athens as well as the increasing cost of managing our IT network.\nAmortization of intangibles increased from 2018 to 2019 due to the new core deposit intangible recorded in connection with the Athens acquisition.\nOur efficiency ratio was 67.4% and 79.7% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The efficiency ratio is the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income and measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. As expected, the efficiency ratio improved in 2019 due to the majority of the non-recurring merger expenses incurred in 2018.\n2018 compared to 2017\nThe increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily the result of an increase in the number of employees in 2018 over 2017. At December 31, 2018, our associate base had expanded to 295 compared to 175 at December 31, 2017. Included in salaries and benefits are stock compensation and cash incentives, which increased over the prior year by approximately $3.8 million due to retention of key employees and improved financial performance of the Company.\nData processing and software expense increased from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to an increase in the volume of transactions from organic growth and costs associated with running dual systems related to our acquisition of Athens. We expect the Athens related systems conversion to occur during the second quarter of 2019.\nThe increase in equipment expense from 2017 to 2018 was related to the increasing cost of managing our IT network.\nMerger related expenses relate to our acquisition of Athens. Amortization of intangibles increased from 2017 to 2018 due to the new core deposit intangible recorded in connection with the Athens acquisition.\nOur efficiency ratio was 79.7% and 64.0% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. The efficiency ratio was negatively impacted by merger expenses in 2018.\nIncome Taxes\n2019 compared to 2018\nWe recorded income tax expense of $6.8 million and $1.2 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our effective income tax rate for 2019 and 2018 was 23.4% and 10.8%, respectively. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate by our investments in municipal securities, company owned life insurance, state tax credits, net of the effect of certain non-deductible expenses and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. The higher effective tax rate in 2019 compared to 2018 is mainly the result of the nontaxable life insurance death benefit proceeds received in 2018 as well as a larger amount of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation in 2018.\n2018 compared to 2017\nWe recorded income tax expense of $1.2 million and $4.6 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our effective income tax rate for 2018 and 2017 was 10.8% and 75.5%, respectively. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate by our investments in municipal securities, company owned life insurance, state tax credits, net of the effect of certain non-deductible expenses and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation and the 2017 tax law change. During 2018, the Company received $2.0 million in nontaxable life insurance death benefit proceeds resulting in a lower effective tax rate for 2018 compared to 2017.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Reform Act was enacted into law. The Tax Reform Act provides for significant changes to the U.S. tax code that impact businesses. Effective January 1, 2018, the U.S. federal tax rate for corporations was reduced from 35% to 21%, for U.S. taxable income and requires a one-time re-measurement of deferred taxes to reflect their value at a lower tax rate of 21%. Accordingly, the Company re-measured its deferred tax assets based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. As a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the Company is required to revalue its net deferred tax assets to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates on this deferred amount and record any change in the value of such assets as a one-time, non-cash charge on its income statement.\nAs a result of the Tax Reform Act, we recorded a $3.6 million increase in income tax expense for 2017. If we were to adjust this $3.6 million write-down out of income tax expense, our adjusted effective tax rate for 2017 would have been 17.5%.\nFinancial Condition\n2019 compared to 2018\nTotal assets increased $73.3 million, or 3.7%, from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Loans decreased from $1.430 billion at December 31, 2018 to $1.420 billion at December 31, 2019, a 0.7% decrease. Loans held for sale increased $110.6 million, or 192.0%, during 2019 which is primarily related to transaction volume of selling residential and commercial real estate loans as a result of continued strong growth. Securities decreased $31.1 million, or 12.6%.\nTotal liabilities increased $54.7 million, or 3.2%, from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Deposits increased from $1.570 billion at December 31, 2018 to $1.729 billion at December 31, 2019, a 10.2% increase. We paid down our Federal Home Loan Bank advances $115.0 million, or 92.0%, from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 as we were able to rely more on deposit funding.\n2018 compared to 2017\nTotal assets increased $619.5 million, or 46.1%, from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. Loans grew from $947.5 million at December 31, 2017 to $1.430 billion at December 31, 2018, a 50.9% increase. Loans held for sale decreased $16.5 million, or 22.2%, during 2018 which is primarily related to the timing of selling residential and commercial real estate loans. Securities increased $51.2 million, or 26.1%. Included in these changes is growth from our acquisition of Athens which included $473.0 million in total assets, primarily made up of $344.8 million in loans and $67.4 million in securities.\nTotal liabilities increased $512.0 million, or 42.8%, from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. Deposits increased from $1.120 billion at December 31, 2017 to $1.570 billion at December 31, 2018, a 40.2% increase. We increased our Federal Home Loan Bank advances $55.0 million, or 78.6%, from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 to help fund loan growth. Total liabilities and deposits from our Athens acquisition were $411.4 million and $404.5 million, respectively.\nInvestment Securities\nThe primary purpose of our investment portfolio is to provide another source of interest income, as well as liquidity management. In managing the composition of the balance sheet, we seek a balance between earnings sources and credit and liquidity considerations. We manage our investment portfolio according to a written investment policy approved by our board of directors. Balances in our investment portfolio are subject to change over time based on our funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives. Our liquidity levels take into account anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of credit, and are maintained at levels we believe are appropriate to assure future flexibility in meeting our anticipated funding needs.\nOur investment portfolio consists primarily of securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored agencies, obligations of states and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and other debt securities, all with varying contractual maturities. However, these maturities do not necessarily represent the expected life of the securities as some of these securities may be called or paid down without penalty prior to their stated maturities. The investment portfolio is regularly reviewed by the Asset Liability Management committee, or ALCO, of the bank to ensure an appropriate risk and return profile as well as for adherence to the investment policy.\nOur investment portfolio totaled $216.4 million, $247.5 million, and $196.4 million at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding investment securities acquired in our acquisition of Athens, our investment portfolio has trended down over the past several years as we have redeployed these funds into higher-earning loans.

During 2015 and continuing through 2019, we recognized growth in the commercial real estate loan classifications reflecting the development of the Target Market in which we operate. The acquisition of Athens increased all loan classifications and provided further diversity in our loan portfolio through more consumer oriented loan products.\nOur primary focus has been on commercial and industrial and commercial real estate lending, which constituted 56% of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2019. Although we expect continued growth with respect to our loan portfolio, we do not expect any significant changes over the foreseeable future in the composition of our loan portfolio or in our emphasis on commercial lending. Our loan growth since inception has been reflective of the Target Market in which we serve. The commercial real estate category includes owner-occupied commercial real estate loans which are similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the affiliated business rather than on the valuation and cash flows of the real estate from unaffiliated tenants. Since 2009, our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate portfolios have continued to experience strong growth, primarily due to implementation of our relationship-based banking model and the success of our relationship managers in transitioning commercial banking relationships from other local financial institutions and in competing for new business from attractive small to mid-sized commercial clients. Many of our larger commercial clients have lengthy relationships with members of our senior management team or our relationship managers that date back to their employment by other financial institutions.\nThe repayment of loans is a source of additional liquidity for us. The following table details maturities and sensitivity to interest rate changes for our loan portfolio at December 31, 2019.\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Due in 1 year or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Due in 1-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Due after 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 361,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 150,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 559,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 207,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 256,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction and land development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 143,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 113,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 233,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 394,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 226,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 737,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 455,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,420,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest rate sensitivity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed interest rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 408,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 186,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 634,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Floating or adjustable interest rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 186,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 329,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 268,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 785,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 226,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 737,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 455,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,420,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe information presented in the table above is based upon the contractual maturities of the individual loans, which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity. Renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval, as well as modification of terms at their maturity. Consequently, we believe that this treatment presents fairly the maturity structure of the loan portfolio.\nAsset Quality\nOne of our key objectives is to maintain a high level of asset quality in our loan portfolio. We utilize disciplined and thorough underwriting processes that collaboratively engage our seasoned and experienced business bankers, credit underwriters and portfolio managers in the analysis of each loan request. Based upon our aggregate exposure to any given borrower relationship, we employ scaled review of loan originations that may involve senior credit officers, our Chief Credit Officer, our bank's Credit Committee or, ultimately, our full board of directors. In addition, we have adopted underwriting guidelines to be followed by our lending officers that require senior management review of proposed extensions of credit exceeding certain thresholds. When delinquencies exist, we monitor the levels of such delinquencies for any negative or adverse trends. Our loan review procedures include approval of lending policies and underwriting guidelines by the board of directors of our bank, an independent loan review, approval of larger credit relationships by our bank's Credit Committee and loan quality documentation procedures. Like other financial institutions, we are subject to the risk that our loan portfolio will be subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions.\nWe target small and medium sized businesses, the owners and operators of such businesses and other consumers and high net worth individuals as loan clients. Because of their size, these borrowers may be less able to withstand competitive or economic pressures than larger borrowers in periods of economic weakness. If loan losses occur at a level where the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease. We use an independent consulting firm to review our loans for quality in addition to the reviews that may be conducted internally and by bank regulatory agencies as part of their examination process. Our bank has procedures and processes in place intended to assess whether losses exceed the potential amounts documented in our bank's impairment analyses and to reduce potential losses in the remaining performing loans within our loan portfolio. These procedures and processes include the following:\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> we monitor the past due and overdraft reports on a weekly basis to identify deterioration as early as possible and the placement of identified loans on the watch list;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> we perform quarterly credit reviews for all watch list/classified loans, including formulation of action plans. When a workout is not achievable, we move to collection/foreclosure proceedings to obtain control of the underlying collateral as rapidly as possible to minimize the deterioration of collateral and/or the loss of its value;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> we require updated financial information, global inventory aging and interest carry analysis where appropriate for existing borrowers to help identify potential future loan payment problems; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> we generally limit loans for new construction to established builders and developers that have an established record of turning their inventories, and we restrict our funding of undeveloped lots and land.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur bank categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. Our bank analyzes loans individually by classifying each loan as to credit risk. This analysis includes all commercial loans and consumer relationships with an outstanding balance greater than $500,000, individually. This analysis is performed on a regular basis by the relationship managers and credit department personnel. On at least a semi-annual basis an independent party performs a formal credit risk review of a sample of the loan portfolio. Among other things, this review assesses the appropriateness of the risk rating of each loan in the sample. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for a table that provides the risk category of loans by applicable class of loans.\nNon-Performing Loans and Assets\nInformation summarizing non-performing assets, including non-accrual loans follows.\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-accrual loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Troubled debt restructurings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans past due greater than 89 days and still accruing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-performing loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreclosed real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-performing assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.28\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.39\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.33\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.12\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.16\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.20\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.27\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.24\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe balance of non-performing assets can fluctuate due to changes in economic conditions. We have established a policy to discontinue accruing interest on loans (that is, place the loans on non-accrual status) after they have become 90 days delinquent as to payment of principal or interest, unless the loans are considered to be well-collateralized and are in the process of collection. Consumer loans and any accrued interest are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. In addition, a loan will not be placed on non-accrual status before it becomes 90 days delinquent unless management believes that the collection of all principal and interest is not expected in a timely manner. Interest previously accrued but uncollected on such loans is reversed and charged against interest income when the receivable is determined to be uncollectible. If we believe that a loan will not be collected in full, we will increase the allowance for loan losses to reflect management's estimate of any potential exposure or loss. Generally, payments received on non-accrual loans are applied directly to principal. As of December 31, 2019, there were not any loans, outside of those included in the table above, that cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of borrowers to comply with present repayment terms.\nDue to the weakening credit status of a borrower, we may elect to formally restructure certain loans to facilitate a repayment plan that seeks to minimize the potential losses, if any, that we might incur. The effect of these changes is assessed to determine if the loan should be classified as a Troubled Debt Restructure. Loans that have been restructured that are on non-accruing status as of the date of restructuring, are included in the nonperforming loan balances as discussed above and are classified as impaired loans. Loans that have been restructured that are on accrual status as of the restructure date are not included in nonperforming loans; however, such loans are still considered impaired.\nAllowance for Loan Losses (allowance)\nOur allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio. We determine the allowance based on an ongoing evaluation of risk as it correlates to potential losses within the portfolio. Increases in the allowance are made by charges to the provision for loan losses. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to our allowance. The judgments and estimates associated with our allowance determination are described under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d above and in Notes 1 and 4 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nThe following table presents a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses for the periods and dates indicated.\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Much of the growth in deposits in 2018 is related to our acquisition of Athens. However, we have been able to increase average noninterest-bearing demand deposits each year as we focus on building and expanding client relationships.

Our ALCO is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed to ensure an acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management.\nInterest Rate Simulation Sensitivity Analysis\nManaging interest rate risk is fundamental for the financial services industry. By considering both on and off-balance sheet financial instruments, management evaluates interest rate sensitivity while attempting to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy, liquidity needs, market opportunities and customer requirements.\nWe use earnings at risk, or EAR, simulations to assess the impact of changing rates on earnings under a variety of scenarios and time horizons. The simulation model is designed to reflect the dynamics of interest earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments. These simulations utilize both instantaneous and parallel changes in the level of interest rates, as well as non-parallel changes such as changing slopes and twists of the yield curve. Static simulation models are based on current exposures and assume a constant balance sheet with no new growth. Dynamic simulation models are also utilized that rely on detailed assumptions regarding changes in existing products, new business, and changes in management and client behavior. By estimating the effects of interest rate increases and decreases, the model can reveal approximate interest rate risk exposure. The simulation model is used by management to gauge approximate results given a specific change in interest rates at a given point in time. The model is therefore a tool to indicate earnings trends in given interest rate scenarios and does not indicate actual expected results.\nAt December 31, 2019, our EAR static simulation results indicated that our balance sheet is asset sensitive to parallel shifts in interest rates. This indicates that our assets generally reprice faster than our liabilities, which results in a favorable impact to net interest income when market interest rates increase and an unfavorable impact to net interest income when market interest rates decline. Many assumptions are used to calculate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest income, such as asset prepayments, non-maturity deposit price sensitivity and decay rates, and key rate drivers. Because of the inherent use of these estimates and assumptions in the model, our actual results may, and most likely will, differ from our static EAR results. In addition, static EAR results do not include actions that our management may undertake to manage the risks in response to anticipated changes in interest rates or client behavior. For example, as part of our asset/liability management strategy, management has the ability to increase asset duration and/or decrease liability duration in order to reduce asset sensitivity, or to decrease asset duration and/or increase liability duration in order to increase asset sensitivity.\nThe following table illustrates the results of our EAR analysis to determine the extent to which our net interest income over the next 12 months would change if prevailing interest rates increased or decreased by the specified amounts.\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net interest income change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase 200bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase 100bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Decrease 100bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Decrease 200bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity Risk Management\nLiquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. To manage liquidity risk, management has established a comprehensive management process for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk. Because of its critical importance to the viability of the Bank, liquidity risk management is fully integrated into our risk management processes. Critical elements of our liquidity risk management include: effective corporate governance consisting of oversight by the board of directors and active involvement by management; appropriate strategies, policies, procedures, and limits used to manage and mitigate liquidity risk; comprehensive liquidity risk measurement and monitoring systems (including assessments of the current and prospective cash flows or sources and uses of funds) that are commensurate with the complexity and business activities of the Bank; active management of intraday liquidity and collateral; an appropriately diverse mix of existing and potential future funding sources; adequate levels of highly liquid marketable securities free of legal, regulatory, or operational impediments, that can be used to meet liquidity needs in stressful situations; comprehensive contingency funding plans that sufficiently address potential adverse liquidity events and emergency cash flow requirements; and internal controls and internal audit processes sufficient to determine the adequacy of the institution's liquidity risk management process.\nThe role of liquidity management is to ensure funds are available to meet depositors' withdrawal and borrowers' credit demands while at the same time optimizing financial results within our corporate guidelines. This is accomplished by balancing changes in demand for funds with changes in the supply of those funds. Liquidity is provided by short-term liquid assets that can be converted to cash, investment securities available-for-sale, various lines of credit available to us, and the ability to attract funds from external sources, principally deposits.\nOur most liquid assets are comprised of cash and due from banks, available-for-sale marketable investment securities and federal funds sold. The fair value of the available-for-sale investment portfolio was $213.1 million at December 31, 2019. We pledge portions of our investment securities portfolio to secure public fund deposits, derivative positions and Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) advances. At December 31, 2019, total investment securities pledged for these purposes comprised 32% of the estimated fair value of the entire investment portfolio, leaving $146.2 million of unpledged securities.\nWe have a large base of non-maturity customer deposits, defined as demand, savings, and money market deposit accounts. At December 31, 2019, such deposits totaled $1.4 billion and represented 82% of our total deposits.\nOther sources of funds available to meet daily needs include FHLB advances. As a member of the FHLB of Cincinnati, the Company has access to credit products offered by the FHLB. The Company views these borrowings as a low cost alternative to other time deposits. At December 31, 2019, available credit from the FHLB totaled $201.4 million. Additionally, we had available federal funds purchased lines with correspondent banks totaling $107.5 million at December 31, 2019.\nThe principal source of cash for CapStar Financial is dividends paid to it as the sole shareholder of the Bank. At December 31, 2019, the Bank was able to pay up to $35.8 million in dividends to CapStar Financial without regulatory approval subject to the ongoing capital requirements of the Bank.\nAccordingly, management believes that our funding sources are at sufficient levels to satisfy our short-term and long-term liquidity needs.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents additional information about contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019, which by their terms have contractual maturity and termination dates subsequent to December 31, 2019.\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> Contractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Due in 1 year or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Due after 1 through 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Due after 3 through 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Due after 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FHLB advances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposits $100,000 or more\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 175,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 230,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposits less than $100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 233,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 328,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBorrowings\nThe following table outlines our sources of short-term borrowed funds during the year ended December 31, 2019, and the amount outstanding at the end of each period, the maximum amount, average amount and average interest rate that we paid for each borrowing source during the period.

We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our clients. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. Most of these commitments mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Standby letters of credit are included in the determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the Company and the Bank are required to hold.\nWe enter into contractual loan commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes. Substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon clients maintaining specific credit standards until the time of loan funding.\nStandby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party. In the event that the client does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, we would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, we would be entitled to seek recovery from the client. Our policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements.\nWe minimize our exposure to loss under loan commitments and standby letters of credit by subjecting them to the same credit approval and monitoring procedures as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. We assess the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit and establish a liability for probable credit losses. The effect on our revenue, expenses, cash flows and liquidity of the unused portions of these commitments cannot be reasonably predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will be used.\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements are summarized in the following table for the periods indicated.\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Contract or notional amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent\ncredit risk:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unused commitments to extend credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 672,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 707,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 584,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 682,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 719,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 596,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis Report includes the following financial measures that have been prepared other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( non-GAAP financial measures\u201d): tangible common equity, tangible common equity to total tangible assets and tangible common equity per share. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures (i) provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, (ii) enable a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business, and (iii) allow investors to evaluate the Company's performance in a manner similar to management, the financial services industry, bank stock analysts and bank regulators; however, the Company acknowledges that its non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. As such, you should not view these disclosures as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, and they are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that other companies use.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of tangible common equity, tangible common equity to total tangible assets and tangible book value per share of common stock to the most

Pronouncements\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in this Report.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation.",
    "summary": "The report provides ans analysis of the financial condition and results of operations for a company for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. It discusses the impact of factors such as acquisitions, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and changes in interest income and expenses. It covers details of net interest income, provision for loan losses, noninterest income, noninterest expense, and effective tax rate. Additionally, critical accounting policies and estimates, including the allowance for loan losses, investment securities impairment, income taxes, and business combinations, are discussed. The report also includes tables summarizing average balances, interest income or expense, average yield or rate, net interest spread, and net interest margin for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the mentioned years.",

    "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is a discussion of our financial condition and our results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing under the caption Part II., Item 8 - Financial Statements, Supplementary Data and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d in this Report. The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements, the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements and the other financial information included elsewhere in this Report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Report. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements except to the extent required by applicable law.\nThe following discussion and analysis pertains to our historical results on a consolidated basis. However, because we conduct all of our material business operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, CapStar Bank, the following discussion and analysis relates to activities primarily conducted at the subsidiary level.\nAll dollar amounts in the tables in this section are in thousands of dollars, except per share data or when otherwise specifically noted. Unless specifically noted in this Report, all references in this section to the fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 mean our fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.\nOverview\nWe completed 2019 with net income of $22.4 million, or $1.20 diluted net income per share, compared to net income of $9.7 million, or $0.67 diluted net income per share, for 2018. Average loans for 2019 were $1.45 billion, a 27.9% increase over 2018, and average deposits for 2019 were $1.67 billion, a 34.2% increase over 2018. The comparability of our financial condition and performance has been impacted by our acquisition of Athens which we completed in 2018 and the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, in each case as discussed below.\nWe acquired Athens on October 1, 2018. On the acquisition date, the fair market value of Athens' net assets was $61.6 million, including $344.8 million in loans and $404.5 million in deposits. Net income for 2018 was reduced by $9.8 million of pretax merger related charges related to this acquisition. The Athens acquisition further expanded our franchise into the East Tennessee market.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. Among other items, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of such decrease, we recognized an increase in income tax expense of $3.56 million in 2017 resulting from the revaluation of our deferred tax assets.\nOur primary revenue source is net interest income and fees from various financial services provided to customers. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets less interest expense on deposit accounts and other interest bearing liabilities. Loan volume and interest rates earned on those loans are critical to our overall profitability. Similarly, deposit volume is crucial to funding loans and the rates paid on deposits directly impact our profitability. Business volumes are influenced by competition, new business acquisition efforts and economic factors including market interest rates, business spending and consumer confidence.\nNet interest income increased $16.0 million, or 31.1%, to $67.7 million for 2019 compared to $51.7 million for 2018. The positive effects of increased volumes and yields on earning assets were partially offset by the negative effects of increasing deposit costs. Net interest margin increased to 3.64% for 2019, compared with 3.55% for 2018.\nProvision for loan losses was $0.8 million in 2019 compared to $2.8 million in 2018, a 73.2% decrease. This decrease was primarily the result of lower charge-offs, which were $0.8 million in 2019 compared to $5.0 million in 2018. The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for loan losses that, in management's evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for the estimated probable inherent losses on outstanding loans. Our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 was 0.89% of total loans, compared with 0.85% of total loans at December 31, 2018.\nTotal noninterest income for 2019 increased $8.8 million, or 57.0%, to $24.3 million compared to $15.5 million for 2018, and comprised 21.0% of total revenues.\nTotal noninterest expense for 2019 increased $8.5 million, or 15.9%, to $62.0 million compared to $53.5 million for 2018. Our efficiency ratio for 2019 was 67.4% compared to 79.7% for 2018. The significant decrease in efficiency ratio for 2019 is primarily attributable to $9.8 million of merger related charges included in noninterest expense for 2018, compared to just $2.7 million in 2019.\nThe Company's effective tax rate increased to 23.4% for 2019 from 10.8% for 2018. The higher effective tax rate in 2019 compared to 2018 is mainly the result of the nontaxable life insurance death benefit proceeds received in 2018 as well as a larger amount of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation in 2018.\nTangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, is a measure of a company's capital which is useful in evaluating the quality and adequacy of capital. Our ratio of tangible common equity to total tangible assets was 11.47% as of December 31, 2019, compared with 10.39% at December 31, 2018. See -Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a discussion of and reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\nThe following sections provide more details on subjects presented in this overview.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, which are contained elsewhere in this Report. Certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may materially and adversely affect our reported results and financial position for the current period or future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are either based on quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have identified the following accounting policies and estimates that, due to the difficult, subjective or complex judgments and assumptions inherent in those policies and estimates and the potential sensitivity of our financial statements to those judgments and assumptions, are critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. We believe that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable and appropriate.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nWe record estimated probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio as an allowance for loan losses. The methodologies and assumptions for determining the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan losses involve significant judgments to be made by management. Some of the more critical judgments supporting our allowance for loan losses include judgments about the credit-worthiness of borrowers, estimated value of underlying collateral, assumptions about cash flow, determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses, and the impact of current events, conditions, and other factors impacting the level of inherent losses. Under different conditions or using different assumptions, the actual or estimated credit losses ultimately realized by us may be different from our estimates. In determining the allowance, we estimate losses on individual impaired loans and on groups of loans that are not impaired, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably estimated. On a quarterly basis, we assess the risk inherent in our loan portfolio based on qualitative and quantitative trends in the portfolio, including the internal risk classification of loans, historical loss rates, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, industry or borrower concentrations, delinquency trends, detailed reviews of significant loans with identified weaknesses, and the impacts of local, regional, and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Based on this analysis, we may record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels. For a more complete discussion of the methodology employed to calculate the allowance for loan losses, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, which is included elsewhere in this Report.\nInvestment Securities Impairment\nWe assess on a quarterly basis whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security with respect to which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In any instance, we would consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the impairment, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, and, for debt securities, external credit ratings and recent downgrades. Securities with respect to which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed using the asset and liability method, which recognizes a liability or asset representing the tax effects, based on current tax law, of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events recognized in the financial statements. A valuation allowance may be established to the extent necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to a level at which it is more likely than not\u201d that the tax asset or benefit will be realized. Realization of tax benefits depends on having sufficient taxable income, available tax loss carrybacks or credits, the reversal of taxable temporary differences and/or tax planning strategies within the reversal period, and that current tax law allows for the realization of recorded tax benefits.\nBusiness Combinations\nAssets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of purchased assets or assumed liabilities. When the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the loans are considered impaired, and the expected cash flows in excess of the amount paid are recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan. The excess of the loan's contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded. We must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses.

    "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is a discussion of our financial condition and our results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing under the caption Part II., Item 8 - Financial Statements, Supplementary Data and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d in this Report. The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements, the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements and the other financial information included elsewhere in this Report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Report. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements except to the extent required by applicable law.\nThe following discussion and analysis pertains to our historical results on a consolidated basis. However, because we conduct all of our material business operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, CapStar Bank, the following discussion and analysis relates to activities primarily conducted at the subsidiary level.\nAll dollar amounts in the tables in this section are in thousands of dollars, except per share data or when otherwise specifically noted. Unless specifically noted in this Report, all references in this section to the fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 mean our fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.\nOverview\nWe completed 2019 with net income of $22.4 million, or $1.20 diluted net income per share, compared to net income of $9.7 million, or $0.67 diluted net income per share, for 2018. Average loans for 2019 were $1.45 billion, a 27.9% increase over 2018, and average deposits for 2019 were $1.67 billion, a 34.2% increase over 2018. The comparability of our financial condition and performance has been impacted by our acquisition of Athens which we completed in 2018 and the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, in each case as discussed below.\nWe acquired Athens on October 1, 2018. On the acquisition date, the fair market value of Athens' net assets was $61.6 million, including $344.8 million in loans and $404.5 million in deposits. Net income for 2018 was reduced by $9.8 million of pretax merger related charges related to this acquisition. The Athens acquisition further expanded our franchise into the East Tennessee market.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. Among other items, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of such decrease, we recognized an increase in income tax expense of $3.56 million in 2017 resulting from the revaluation of our deferred tax assets.\nOur primary revenue source is net interest income and fees from various financial services provided to customers. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets less interest expense on deposit accounts and other interest bearing liabilities. Loan volume and interest rates earned on those loans are critical to our overall profitability. Similarly, deposit volume is crucial to funding loans and the rates paid on deposits directly impact our profitability. Business volumes are influenced by competition, new business acquisition efforts and economic factors including market interest rates, business spending and consumer confidence.\nNet interest income increased $16.0 million, or 31.1%, to $67.7 million for 2019 compared to $51.7 million for 2018. The positive effects of increased volumes and yields on earning assets were partially offset by the negative effects of increasing deposit costs. Net interest margin increased to 3.64% for 2019, compared with 3.55% for 2018.\nProvision for loan losses was $0.8 million in 2019 compared to $2.8 million in 2018, a 73.2% decrease. This decrease was primarily the result of lower charge-offs, which were $0.8 million in 2019 compared to $5.0 million in 2018. The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for loan losses that, in management's evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for the estimated probable inherent losses on outstanding loans. Our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 was 0.89% of total loans, compared with 0.85% of total loans at December 31, 2018.\nTotal noninterest income for 2019 increased $8.8 million, or 57.0%, to $24.3 million compared to $15.5 million for 2018, and comprised 21.0% of total revenues.\nTotal noninterest expense for 2019 increased $8.5 million, or 15.9%, to $62.0 million compared to $53.5 million for 2018. Our efficiency ratio for 2019 was 67.4% compared to 79.7% for 2018. The significant decrease in efficiency ratio for 2019 is primarily attributable to $9.8 million of merger related charges included in noninterest expense for 2018, compared to just $2.7 million in 2019.\nThe Company's effective tax rate increased to 23.4% for 2019 from 10.8% for 2018. The higher effective tax rate in 2019 compared to 2018 is mainly the result of the nontaxable life insurance death benefit proceeds received in 2018 as well as a larger amount of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation in 2018.\nTangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, is a measure of a company's capital which is useful in evaluating the quality and adequacy of capital. Our ratio of tangible common equity to total tangible assets was 11.47% as of December 31, 2019, compared with 10.39% at December 31, 2018. See -Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a discussion of and reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\nThe following sections provide more details on subjects presented in this overview.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, which are contained elsewhere in this Report. Certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may materially and adversely affect our reported results and financial position for the current period or future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are either based on quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have identified the following accounting policies and estimates that, due to the difficult, subjective or complex judgments and assumptions inherent in those policies and estimates and the potential sensitivity of our financial statements to those judgments and assumptions, are critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. We believe that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable and appropriate.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nWe record estimated probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio as an allowance for loan losses. The methodologies and assumptions for determining the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan losses involve significant judgments to be made by management. Some of the more critical judgments supporting our allowance for loan losses include judgments about the credit-worthiness of borrowers, estimated value of underlying collateral, assumptions about cash flow, determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses, and the impact of current events, conditions, and other factors impacting the level of inherent losses. Under different conditions or using different assumptions, the actual or estimated credit losses ultimately realized by us may be different from our estimates. In determining the allowance, we estimate losses on individual impaired loans and on groups of loans that are not impaired, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably estimated. On a quarterly basis, we assess the risk inherent in our loan portfolio based on qualitative and quantitative trends in the portfolio, including the internal risk classification of loans, historical loss rates, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, industry or borrower concentrations, delinquency trends, detailed reviews of significant loans with identified weaknesses, and the impacts of local, regional, and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Based on this analysis, we may record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels. For a more complete discussion of the methodology employed to calculate the allowance for loan losses, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, which is included elsewhere in this Report.\nInvestment Securities Impairment\nWe assess on a quarterly basis whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security with respect to which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In any instance, we would consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the impairment, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, and, for debt securities, external credit ratings and recent downgrades. Securities with respect to which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed using the asset and liability method, which recognizes a liability or asset representing the tax effects, based on current tax law, of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events recognized in the financial statements. A valuation allowance may be established to the extent necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to a level at which it is more likely than not\u201d that the tax asset or benefit will be realized. Realization of tax benefits depends on having sufficient taxable income, available tax loss carrybacks or credits, the reversal of taxable temporary differences and/or tax planning strategies within the reversal period, and that current tax law allows for the realization of recorded tax benefits.\nBusiness Combinations\nAssets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of purchased assets or assumed liabilities. When the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the loans are considered impaired, and the expected cash flows in excess of the amount paid are recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan. The excess of the loan's contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded. We must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield which will have a positive impact on interest income. Purchased loans without evidence of credit deterioration are recorded at their initial fair value and adjusted as necessary for subsequent advances, pay downs, amortization or accretion of any premium or discount on purchase, charge-offs and additional provisions that may be required.\nResults of Operations\nThe following is a summary of our results of operations:\nTable 109: <table> <tr>

significant factors affecting our operating results.\nNet Interest Income\nThe largest component of our net income is net interest income - the difference between the income earned on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets and interest expense on deposit accounts and other interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income calculated on a tax-equivalent bais divided by total average interest-earning assets represents our net interest margin. The major factors that affect net interest income and net interest margin are changes in volumes, the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Our margin can also be affected by economic conditions, the competitive environment, loan demand and deposit flow. Our ability to respond to changes in these factors by using effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and our net interest income.\nThe following table sets forth the amount of our average balances, interest income or interest expense for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the average interest rate for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 110:
