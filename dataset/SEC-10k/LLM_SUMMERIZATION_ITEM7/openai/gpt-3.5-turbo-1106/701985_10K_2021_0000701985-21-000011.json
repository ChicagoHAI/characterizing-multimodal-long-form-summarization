MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") as codified in the Accounting Standards Codification. The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOur operating results are generally impacted by economic changes and, therefore, we monitor the retail environment using, among other things, certain key industry performance indicators including competitor performance and mall traffic data. These can provide insight into consumer spending patterns and shopping behavior in the current retail environment and assist us in assessing our performance as well as the potential impact of industry trends on our future operating results. Additionally, we evaluate a number of key performance indicators including comparable sales, gross profit, operating income and other performance metrics such as sales per average selling square foot and inventory per selling square foot in assessing our performance.\nCOVID-19\nIn March 2020, the spread of COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. This pandemic has negatively affected the U.S. and global economies, disrupted global supply chains and financial markets, and led to significant travel and transportation restrictions, including mandatory closures and orders to shelter-in-place.\u201d The actions that governments around the world have taken to contain the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in a period of disruption, including closure of our stores, limited store operating hours, reduced customer traffic and consumer spending and delays in manufacturing and shipping of products and raw materials. During this period, we are focused on protecting the health and safety of our customers, employees, contractors, suppliers and other business partners. We are also working with our suppliers to minimize potential disruptions, while managing our business in response to a changing dynamic.\nOur business operations and financial performance for 2020 were materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. All of our stores in North America were closed on March 17, 2020 but we were able to re-open the majority of our stores as of the beginning of the third quarter. Operations for Victoria's Secret Direct were temporarily suspended for approximately one week in late March 2020, while Bath & Body Works Direct remained open for the duration of fiscal 2020. Additionally, we have dedicated resources to maximize capacity in our direct fulfillment centers to meet increased customer demand, while focusing on distribution, fulfillment and call center safety. There remains a high level of uncertainty around the pandemic and the potential for further restrictions.\nSegments\nIn the third quarter of 2020, we changed our segment reporting as a result of leadership changes and restructuring actions taken to facilitate the ongoing efforts to separate Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret into separate businesses. We now have two reportable segments: Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret. Accordingly, we will no longer report a Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International segment as these businesses are now included with their respective brand. Additionally, the Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret segments now include sourcing and production functions (formerly known as Mast) and certain other corporate functions that directly support each brand. These functions were previously included within Other. While this reporting change did not impact our consolidated results, the segment data has been recast to be consistent for all periods presented.\nExecutive Overview\nThe pandemic had a profound impact on the retail industry and our business. In response, we led with our values and an emphasis on safety, so we could be confident in our decisions and actions to support associates, customers, partners and our businesses. Accordingly, we adopted new operating models in our stores focused on providing a safe environment, while also delivering an engaging shopping experience. Additionally, we remain focused on the safe operations of our distribution, fulfillment and call centers while maximizing our direct channels. We implemented cost reduction and performance improvements at Victoria's Secret, while continuing to drive substantial growth at Bath & Body Works and improved performance at Victoria's Secret.\nWe are committed to establishing our Bath & Body Works business as a pure-play public company and are taking the necessary steps to prepare the Victoria's Secret business, including PINK, to operate as a separate standalone company. Our Board of Directors is currently evaluating all options, including a potential spin-off of the Victoria's Secret business into a public company or a private sale of the business.\nDuring 2020, we took a number of important steps to improve performance at Victoria's Secret and to prepare Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret to operate as separate standalone companies, including:\n\u2022Retaining Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan as financial advisors on the separation of Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret;\n\u2022Completing a comprehensive review of our home office organizations in order to achieve meaningful reductions in overhead expenses and decentralize significant shared functions and services to support the creation of standalone companies. This resulted in a reduction of our home office headcount by approximately 15%, or about 850 associates;\n\u2022Executing our previously announced plan to permanently close 241 Victoria's Secret stores in the U.S. and Canada while also negotiating with landlords for ongoing rent relief;\n\u2022Closing the unprofitable Hong Kong flagship store, restructuring lease terms on the two mainland China flagship stores and implementing a significant overhead expense reduction plan; and\n\u2022Managing inventories with discipline, including working with suppliers to identify opportunities to reduce merchandise costs in order to increase merchandise margin rates at Victoria's Secret and PINK.\nWe expect to deliver $400 million of annual savings under our profit improvement plan outlined above, which was implemented at the beginning of the third quarter. Roughly half of the savings were realized in the back half of fiscal 2020, principally at Victoria's Secret, with the remainder expected to be realized in the first half of fiscal 2021.\nGrowth Strategy\nWe have a multi-year goal to increase sales and operating income by focusing on these key business priorities:\n\u2022Grow our business in North America;\n\u2022Extend our brand internationally; and\n\u2022Focus on the fundamentals of our business.\nWe also continue to focus on:\n\u2022Attracting and retaining top talent;\n\u2022Maintaining a strong cash and liquidity position while optimizing our capital structure; and\n\u2022Returning value to our shareholders.\nThe following is a discussion regarding certain of our key business priorities:\nGrow our business in North America\nWe see opportunities for meaningful growth in all our categories by focusing on product newness and innovation and expanding into under-penetrated markets and price segments. We will continue to invest in the Bath & Body Works White Barn store design, which continues to yield strong results. In 2021, we are forecasting approximately 50 new Bath & Body Works North America stores, almost entirely off-mall, partially offset by about 20 to 40 closures, principally in malls, resulting in net square footage growth of 3% to 4%.\nWe are focused on continued innovation and enhancements to our digital platforms and applications, and development of omni-channel capabilities that integrate our online presence with our stores. During 2020, we tested BOPIS at certain of our Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret stores and expect to continue improving our online and in-store BOPIS experience during 2021.\nExtend our brand internationally\nWe believe there is substantial opportunity for international growth. We have separate, dedicated teams that have taken a methodical, \"test and learn\" approach to expansion. We plan to expand our presence outside of North America by increasing the number of stores operated by our international partners.\nOur partners opened 10 net new Bath & Body Works stores in 2020, bringing the total in the Middle East, Latin America, Southeast Asia and Europe to 288 stores. Additionally, our partners opened 16 new international digital sites. Our partners plan to open another 50 to 70 new international stores, increasing our store count by 15% to 23%, in 2021.\nAt Victoria's Secret in 2021, our partners will continue to expand international digital operations with the opening of another 20 websites. Additionally, in 2020, we entered into a joint venture with Next PLC for the Victoria's Secret business in the U.K. and Ireland. We believe Next's capabilities and experience in the U.K. market will provide meaningful growth opportunities for the business.\nFocus on the fundamentals of our business\nWe are focused on the fundamentals of our business which include knowing our customers, focusing on core merchandise categories, inventory management, speed and agility, managing real estate and store selling and execution. In terms of speed and agility, we are focused on inventory discipline through lead-time reductions and in-season agility to increase sales and reduce promotional activity. In terms of real estate, we will continue to proactively and rigorously review our portfolio, and we will continue to open and close stores when we believe it makes sense to do so. We continue to optimize our store selling and execution by concentrating on a better store experience and developing, retaining and investing in talented, trained and productive store associates. In the direct businesses, we continue to focus on ensuring a positive customer experience on our websites and developing our fulfillment capacity in order to provide delivery times that meet our customer's needs.\n2020 Overview\nDespite operating in the COVID-19 environment, both our segments were able to meaningfully improve performance, driven primarily by strong growth in our direct channels. 2020 net sales were $11.847 billion, and total comparable sales increased 21%. The gross profit rate increased 490 basis points to 39.4%, driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate. General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses declined 11% and leveraged approximately 80 basis points. The dollar decline was driven by our profit improvement plan and the closure of 248 Victoria's Secret stores. Operating income for the full year increased $1.322 billion to $1.580 billion driven by merchandise margin growth at Bath & Body Works, savings realized on our profit improvement plan and Victoria's Secret goodwill impairment charges of $720 million recorded in 2019. The total company operating income rate increased to 13.3% in 2020 from 2.0% last year.\nFor the Bath & Body Works segment, net sales grew by 20%, or $1.078 billion, to $6.434 billion and total comparable sales increased 45%. Store comparable sales increased 26% and our direct channel grew sales by 109%. Our store sales were roughly flat to last year at $4.207 billion, despite the fact that the majority of stores were closed for roughly 3 months. We surpassed the $2 billion mark in the direct channel with full-year sales of $2.003 billion in 2020. Segment operating income for 2020 was $1.821 billion, up 49% compared to last year, and the operating income rate was 28.3%, an increase of 540 basis points compared to last year.\nFor the Victoria's Secret segment, net sales declined by 28%, or $2.096 billion, to $5.413 billion, and total comparable sales increased 1%. Store comparable sales declined 15% and our direct channel grew sales by 31%. Our North America store sales were down 45%, or $2.317 billion, to last year. Store sales were negatively impacted by the temporary COVID-19-related closures, declines in store traffic, particularly constrained on high volume Holiday days, occupancy restrictions and the impact of the 241 North American stores that were permanently closed. Sales in the direct channel were $2.223 billion, up 31% to last year despite a temporary suspension of operations in March 2020. International revenue declined by $309 million in 2020, or 44%, driven by pandemic related store closures and the exclusion of U.K. retail sales due to the establishment of the joint venture with Next. Segment operating loss decreased by $757 million to $25 million in 2020, primarily driven by the benefits of our profit improvement plan and by goodwill impairment charges of $720 million recorded in 2019, partially offset by the impact of store closures as a result of the pandemic in the first half of the year.\nFor additional information related to our 2020 financial performance, see Results of Operations - 2020 Compared to 2019.\u201d\nImpacts of COVID-19\nIn response to the global COVID-19 crisis, we took prudent actions to manage expenses and to maintain our solid cash position and financial flexibility. We:\n\u2022Furloughed most store associates as of April 5, 2020 during the temporary store closures, while continuing to provide healthcare benefits for eligible associates;\n\u2022Suspended associate merit increases;\n\u2022Temporarily reduced salaries for senior vice presidents and above by 20%;\n\u2022Temporarily suspended cash compensation for all members of the Board of Directors;\n\u2022Reduced fiscal 2020 capital expenditures from an original forecast of $550 million to $228 million;\n\u2022Actively managed inventory to adjust for the impact of channel shifts to meet customer demand;\n\u2022Temporarily suspended the quarterly cash dividend beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2020;\n\u2022Suspended many store and select office rent payments during the temporary closures. We completed negotiations with the majority of landlords, leading to a combination of rent waivers or abatements relating to closure periods, rent relief relating to the post-reopening recovery\u201d period given traffic declines, and rent deferrals;\n\u2022Converted the revolving credit facility to an asset-backed loan facility, issued $2.25 billion in new notes and extinguished $1.259 billion of notes primarily with near-term maturities; and\n\u2022Extended payment terms to vendors.\nAs of January 30, 2021, we had $3.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents with no outstanding borrowings on our ABL Facility.\nAdjusted Financial Information\nIn addition to our results provided in accordance with GAAP above and throughout this Form 10-K, provided below are non-GAAP measurements which present operating income, net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share in 2020, 2019 and 2018 on an adjusted basis, which remove certain special items. We believe that these special items are not indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and nature. We use adjusted financial information as key performance measures of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Instead, we believe that the presentation of adjusted financial information provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. Further, our definition of adjusted financial information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. The table below reconciles the GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures.\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n2021 Outlook\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we expect our operating performance to increase significantly compared to last year. The remainder of the year will present more challenging comparisons to last year, although we do expect growth versus 2019. We experienced record productivity and strong growth online in 2020. In 2020, Bath & Body Works grew operating income by $153 million, or 84%, in the second quarter, by $285 million, or 137%, in the third quarter and by $250 million, or 38%, in the fourth quarter. Strong demand allowed us to significantly pull back on promotional activity, and the 2020 operating income rate was 28.3%.\nWe believe an operating margin in the low to mid-twenties is appropriate for the current Bath & Body Works segment, which reflects the right value/quality proposition for our customers, as well as the right level of investment in product innovation, quality and engaging, best-in-class store and online experiences. We will continue to focus on maximizing our performance, leveraging the strength of our brand, our close connection to our customers and the speed we have in our supply chain, and we have confidence in our opportunities for long-term growth.\nIn the Victoria's Secret business, we believe we have opportunities for continued improved performance, particularly in the first half of the year, driven by improved assortments, more disciplined inventory management, our profit improvement plan and lapping 2020 pandemic related store closures. We have long-term opportunities for growth in the Victoria's Secret business, which continues to lead the lingerie market, and are targeting a 10-15% operating margin.\nWe caution there is ongoing uncertainty in the current environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as an impending separation of the Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret businesses, which we are targeting to complete in August 2021. Over the next 6 months, we will continue to work toward the separation of the two businesses, proceeding down a dual track to prepare for either a spin-off or a sale.\nCompany-Operated Store Data\nThe following table compares 2020 company-operated store data to the comparable periods for 2019 and 2018:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales per Average Selling Square Foot (a) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bath & Body Works U.S. </td> <td>$ </td> <td>916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>891 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Victoria's Secret U.S. </td> <td>415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>684 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td>(7 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales per Average Store (in thousands) (a) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bath & Body Works U.S. </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Victoria's Secret U.S. </td> <td>2,789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td>(6 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Store Size (selling square feet) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bath & Body Works U.S. </td> <td>2,660 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Victoria's Secret U.S. </td> <td>6,928 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Selling Square Feet (in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bath & Body Works U.S. </td> <td>4,343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Victoria's Secret U.S. </td> <td>5,861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,898 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td>(3 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\n(a)Sales per average selling square foot and sales per average store, which are indicators of store productivity, are calculated based on store sales for the period divided by the average, including the beginning and end of period, of total square footage and store count, respectively.

The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. The change in comparable sales provides an indication of period over period growth (decline). A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open 12 months or more and it has\nnot had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Stores are excluded from the comparable sales calculation if they have been closed for four consecutive days or more. Therefore, comparable sales results for 2020 exclude stores that were closed for four consecutive days or more as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales is calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis. Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis.\n(b)Includes company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada.\n(c)Includes company-operated stores in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. (pre-joint venture) and Greater China.\nThe results by segment are as follows:\nBath & Body Works\nFor 2020, net sales increased $1.079 billion to $6.434 billion; comparable sales increased 45%; and comparable store sales increased 26%. In both channels, sales were strong across all merchandise categories, driven by continued high demand for soaps and sanitizers combined with strong sales performance in home fragrance and body care. The Bath & Body Works Direct channel, which remained open throughout the year, grew sales by 109% to $2.003 billion and we have focused on increasing our fulfillment capacity to meet the increase in demand. We are achieving increased productivity while maintaining standard delivery times for our customers. These increases were partially offset by a decrease as a result of the COVID-19-related store closures as our stores were closed for a significant amount of time, primarily in the first and second quarter.\nThe increase in comparable sales was driven by increases in digital traffic, conversion and average unit retail, partially offset by a decline in store traffic.\nVictoria's Secret\nFor 2020, net sales decreased $2.096 billion to $5.413 billion; comparable sales increased 1%; and comparable store sales decreased 15%. Net sales decreased due to the store closures impacting company-operated and partner-operated stores and due to declines in store traffic. These declines were partially offset by an increase in Victoria's Secret Direct channel sales, which increased 31% to $2.223 billion despite a temporary suspension of operations in March, reflecting growth in Lingerie, PINK and Beauty.\nThe increase in comparable sales was driven by increases in digital traffic, conversion and average unit retail, partially offset by a decline in store traffic.\nOther\nFor 2020, net sales decreased $50 million as we no longer provide sourcing services to La Senza, a company we divested in fiscal 2018.\nGross Profit\nFor 2020, our gross profit increased $217 million to $4.667 billion, and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) increased to 39.4% from 34.5% primarily as a result of:\nBath & Body Works\nFor 2020, the gross profit increase was due to increased merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales and the strong customer response to our merchandise assortment which allowed us to strategically pull back on promotional activity and marketing related offers, partially offset by higher expenses due to increased direct channel fulfillment and shipping costs.\nThe gross profit rate increase was driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate reflecting a meaningful pullback in promotional activity and buying and occupancy leverage on higher net sales.\nVictoria's Secret\nFor 2020, the gross profit decrease was due to lower merchandise margin dollars related to the decrease in net sales due to store closures. This decrease was partially offset by improved response to our merchandise assortments, the disciplined management of inventory, as well as strong selling execution in stores and online, all of which enabled us to reduce promotional activity during the year. Additionally, occupancy expenses were lower this year due to the store closures, rent relief totaling $90 million and a $34 million decrease in store and lease asset impairment charges recognized in occupancy expense.\nThe gross profit rate increase was driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate reflecting a meaningful pullback in promotional activity, partially offset by buying and occupancy deleverage on lower net sales.\nGeneral, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses\nFor 2020, our general, administrative and store operating expenses decreased $385 million to $3.087 billion due to reductions at Victoria's Secret driven by lower store selling and marketing expenses as a result of permanent store closures and our profit improvement plan, and a net $29 million pre-tax gain resulting from the formation of the Victoria's Secret U.K. joint venture. These decreases were partially offset by severance and related costs associated with headcount reductions totaling $81 million and increases in Bath & Body Works store selling expenses due to the increase in net sales and to support COVID-19 guidelines.\nThe general, administrative and store operating expense rate decreased to 26.1% from 26.9% due to savings realized on our profit improvement plan, leverage at Bath & Body Works with higher sales, and the Victoria's Secret U.K. gain, partially offset by deleverage at Victoria's Secret on lower net sales and the severance and related costs.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nIn 2019, our goodwill impairment assessments concluded that the carrying values of our Victoria's Secret and Victoria's Secret Greater China reporting units exceeded their fair values. Accordingly, we recognized pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $720 million in the Victoria's Secret segment.\nOther Income (Loss) and Expenses\nInterest Expense\nThe following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for 2020 and 2019:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average daily borrowings (in millions) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,725 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average borrowing rate (in percentages) </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2020, our interest expense increased $60 million to $438 million due to both higher average daily borrowings and average borrowing rate.\nOther Loss\nFor 2020, our other loss of $50 million consisted primarily of a $53 million pre-tax loss associated with the early extinguishment of outstanding notes recognized in 2020. For 2019, our other loss was $61 million, primarily due to a $40 million pre-tax loss associated with the early extinguishment of outstanding notes and a $37 million charge to increase reserves related to ongoing contingent obligations for the La Senza business, partially offset by interest income received on invested cash.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor 2020, our effective tax rate was 22.7% compared to (101.9%) in 2019. The 2020 rate varied from our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters, which resulted in a $50 million tax benefit, and tax matters associated with foreign investments and recent changes in tax legislation, which resulted in a $23 million tax benefit. The 2019 rate was impacted by the Victoria's Secret goodwill impairment charges, which generated minimal tax benefit.\nResults of Operations-Fourth Quarter of 2020 Compared to Fourth Quarter of 2019\nThe following information summarizes our results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nOperating Income (Loss)\nThe following table provides our segment operating income (loss) and operating income (loss) rates (expressed as a percentage of net sales) for the fourth quarter of 2020 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2019:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fourth Quarter </td> <td> </td> <td>Operating Income (Loss) Rate </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bath & Body Works </td> <td>$ </td> <td>914 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>29.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Victoria's Secret </td> <td>403 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(531) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.5 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (a) </td> <td>(44) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(51) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Operating Income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\n(a)Includes corporate infrastructure and governance functions, and other non-recurring items that are deemed to be corporate in nature.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2020, operating income increased $1.191 billion to $1.273 billion, and the operating income rate increased to 26.4% from 1.7%.

The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. The change in comparable sales provides an indication of period over period growth (decline). A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Stores are excluded from the comparable sales calculation if they have been closed for four consecutive days or more. Therefore, comparable sales results for the fourth quarter of 2020 exclude stores that were closed for four consecutive days or more as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales is calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis. Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis.\n(b)Includes company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada.\n(c)Includes company-operated stores in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. (pre-joint venture) and Greater China.\nThe results by segment are as follows:\nBath & Body Works\nFor the fourth quarter of 2020, net sales increased $488 million to $2.719 billion; comparable sales increased 22%; and comparable store sales increased 9%. We achieved growth in all merchandise categories with two-thirds of our dollar growth coming from our home fragrance and body care categories, and one-third of the growth coming from soaps and sanitizers. In the direct channel, fourth quarter sales increased by 74%, or $319 million. We focused on increasing our fulfillment capacity to meet the significant increase in demand, and, as a result, are achieving record productivity while maintaining consistent delivery times for our customers. Traffic in the stores channel was limited during the Holiday time period by capacity constraints in stores on high volume days.\nThe increase in comparable sales was driven by increases in digital traffic, conversion and average unit retail, partially offset by a decline in store traffic, which was particularly constrained on high volume Holiday days.\nVictoria's Secret\nFor the fourth quarter of 2020, net sales decreased $376 million to $2.100 billion; comparable sales decreased 3%; and comparable store sales decreased 18%. Net sales decreased due to the permanent store closures and declines in store traffic. These declines were partially offset by an increase in Victoria's Secret Direct channel sales, which increased 33% to $831 million, reflecting growth in Lingerie, PINK and Beauty.\nThe decrease in comparable sales was driven by a decline in store traffic, which was particularly constrained on high volume Holiday days, partially offset by increases in conversion, average unit retail and digital traffic.\nGross Profit\nFor the fourth quarter of 2020, our gross profit increased $515 million to $2.309 billion, and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) increased to 47.9% from 38.1% primarily as a result of:\nBath & Body Works\nFor the fourth quarter of 2020, the gross profit increase was due to increased merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales and the strong customer response to our merchandise assortment which allowed us to strategically pull back on promotional activity and marketing related offers, partially offset by higher expenses due to increased direct channel fulfillment and shipping costs.\nThe gross profit rate increase was driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate reflecting a meaningful pullback in promotional activity and buying and occupancy leverage on higher net sales.\nVictoria's Secret\nFor the fourth quarter of 2020, the gross profit increase was due to improved response to our merchandise assortments, the disciplined management of inventory, as well as strong selling execution in stores and online, all of which enabled us to reduce promotional activity during the quarter. Additionally, occupancy expenses were lower this period due to the permanent store closures, rent relief totaling $66 million and a $30 million decrease in store and lease asset impairment charges recognized in occupancy expense. These increases were partially offset by lower merchandise margin dollars related to the decrease in net sales.\nThe gross profit rate increase was primarily driven by a higher merchandise margin rate reflecting a meaningful pullback in promotional activity, leverage on buying and occupancy expense from the mix shift to the direct channel, and the higher asset impairment charges in the prior year.\nGeneral, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses\nFor the fourth quarter of 2020, our general, administrative and store operating expenses increased $12 million to $1.034 billion due to an increase in Bath & Body Works store selling expenses due to the increase in net sales and to support COVID-19 guidelines, and an increase in incentive compensation payouts given company performance, partially offset by reductions at Victoria's Secret driven by lower store selling and other expenses as a result of our profit improvement plan and store closures.\nThe general, administrative and store operating expense rate decreased to 21.5% from 21.7% driven by leverage on higher net sales.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, our annual goodwill impairment assessment concluded that the carrying value of the Victoria's Secret reporting unit exceeded its fair value. Accordingly, we recognized a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $690 million in the Victoria's Secret segment.\nOther Income (Loss) and Expenses\nInterest Expense\nThe following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019:\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average daily borrowings (in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,499 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,617 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average borrowing rate (in percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td>7.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the fourth quarter of 2020, our interest expense increased $25 million to $117 million due to both higher average daily borrowings and average borrowing rate.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor the fourth quarter of 2020, our effective tax rate was 25.5%, in line with our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate. The 2019 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the Victoria's Secret goodwill impairment charge, which generated minimal tax benefit in the U.S.\nResults of Operations-2019 Compared to 2018\nThe following information summarizes our results of operations for 2019 compared to 2018.\nOperating Income (Loss)\nThe following table provides our segment operating income (loss) and operating income (loss) rates (expressed as a percentage of net sales) for 2019 in comparison to 2018:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Operating Income (Loss) Rate </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bath & Body Works </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>23.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Victoria's Secret </td> <td>(782) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.4 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (a) </td> <td>(184) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(384) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(369.1 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td>(107.1 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Operating Income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\n(a)Includes corporate infrastructure and governance functions, and other non-recurring items that are deemed to be corporate in nature.

The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. The change in comparable sales provides an indication of period over period growth (decline). A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales is calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis. Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis.\n(b)Includes company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada.\n(c)Includes company-operated stores in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Greater China.\nThe results by segment are as follows:\nBath & Body Works\nFor 2019, net sales increased $579 million to $5.355 billion; comparable sales increased 10%; and comparable store sales increased 5%. Net sales increased in all of our main categories including home fragrance, body care and soaps and sanitizers, which incorporated newness, innovation and fashion.\nThe increase in comparable sales was driven by increases in store conversion and digital traffic.\nVictoria's Secret\nFor 2019, net sales decreased $594 million to $7.509 billion; comparable sales decreased 8%; and comparable store sales decreased 9%. Victoria's Secret Lingerie comparable sales were down in the high-single digit range, primarily due to declines in bras and apparel, driven by merchandise performance. PINK comparable sales were down in the low-double digit range, primarily driven by declines in apparel, principally in tops, due to merchandise performance and the exit of the swim business. Victoria's Secret Beauty comparable sales increased in the low-single digit range, as growth in accessories and PINK beauty were partially offset by a decline in the lip business.\nThe decrease in comparable sales was driven by declines in store traffic, average unit retail and digital conversion.\nOther\nFor 2019, net sales decreased $308 million primarily due to the sale of La Senza and closure of Henri Bendel in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nGross Profit\nFor 2019, our gross profit decreased $449 million to $4.450 billion, and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 34.5% from 37.0% primarily as a result of:\nBath & Body Works\nFor 2019, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to higher distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales and investments in store real estate.\nThe gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increases in supply chain and sourcing costs and the sales mix shift into the direct business, which has a lower merchandise margin rate than the stores channel.\nVictoria's Secret\nFor 2019, the gross profit decrease was primarily driven by lower merchandise margin dollars related to the decrease in net sales and an increase in long-lived store asset impairment charges, from $101 million in 2018 to $263 million in 2019.\nThe gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increased promotions to drive traffic and clear inventory, the increase in long-lived store asset impairment charges and buying and occupancy deleverage on lower net sales.\nGeneral, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses\nFor 2019, our general, administrative and store operating expenses decreased $91 million to $3.472 billion due to the elimination of the La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses and lower marketing and store selling expenses at Victoria's Secret, partially offset by higher selling and marketing expenses related to higher sales volume at Bath & Body Works.\nThe general, administrative and store operating expense rate remained flat at 26.9% as the absence of the higher-rate La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses and declines in marketing and store selling expenses at Victoria's Secret were offset by deleverage on lower net sales.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nIn 2019, our goodwill impairment assessments concluded that the carrying values of our Victoria's Secret and Victoria's Secret Greater China reporting units exceeded their fair values. Accordingly, we recognized pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $720 million in the Victoria's Secret segment.\nLoss on Divestiture of La Senza\nIn 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of La Senza of $99 million related to the recognition of $45 million of accumulated translation adjustments and the loss related to the transfer of the net working capital and long-lived store assets to the buyer.\nOther Income (Loss) and Expenses\nInterest Expense\nThe following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for 2019 and 2018:\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average daily borrowings (in millions) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,853 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average borrowing rate (in percentages) </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2019, our interest expense decreased $7 million to $378 million due to lower average daily borrowings.\nOther Income (Loss)\nFor 2019, our other income (loss) decreased $66 million to a $61 million loss due to a $40 million pre-tax loss associated with the early extinguishment of $764 million in outstanding notes maturing between 2020 and 2022 and $37 million of charges to increase reserves related to ongoing contingent obligations for the La Senza business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor 2019, our effective tax rate was (101.9%) compared to 24.9% in 2018. The 2019 rate varied from our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the Victoria's Secret goodwill impairment charges, which generated minimal tax benefit. The 2018 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the tax effects of the divestiture of the La Senza business.\nResults of Operations-Fourth Quarter of 2019 Compared to Fourth Quarter of 2018\nThe following information summarizes our results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.\nOperating Income (Loss)\nThe following table provides our segment operating income (loss) and operating income (loss) rates (expressed as a percentage of net sales) for the fourth quarter of 2019 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2018:\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fourth Quarter </td> <td> </td> <td>Operating Income (Loss) Rate </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bath & Body Works </td> <td>$ </td> <td>664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>610 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>30.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Victoria's Secret </td> <td>(531) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.5 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td>13.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (a) </td> <td>(51) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(172) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(160.4 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Operating Income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>16.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> ________________\n(a)Includes corporate infrastructure and governance functions, and other non-recurring items that are deemed to be corporate in nature.

The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. The change in comparable sales provides an indication of period over period growth (decline). A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales is calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis. Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis.\n(b)Includes company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada.\n(c)Includes company-operated stores in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Greater China.\nThe results by segment are as follows:\nBath & Body Works\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, net sales increased $236 million to $2.231 billion; comparable sales increased 10%; and comparable store sales increased 5%. Net sales increased in all of our main categories including home fragrance, body care and soaps and sanitizers, which incorporated newness, innovation and fashion.\nThe increase in comparable sales was driven by increases in store conversion and digital traffic.\nVictoria's Secret\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, net sales decreased $274 million to $2.476 billion; comparable sales decreased 10%; and comparable store sales decreased 11%. Victoria's Secret Lingerie comparable sales were down in the mid-teens as we continued to pull back promotional activity in bras, and due to merchandise performance in sleepwear. PINK comparable sales were down in the mid-teens driven by declines in apparel, principally in tops, due to merchandise performance. PINK lingerie sales were about flat to last year. Victoria's Secret Beauty comparable sales increased in the low-single digit range due to growth in prestige fragrance, driven by a strong launch of Bombshell Intense, and in PINK beauty and accessories.\nThe decrease in comparable sales was driven by declines in store traffic, average unit retail and digital conversion.\nOther\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, net sales decreased $107 million primarily due to the sale of La Senza and closure of Henri Bendel in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nGross Profit\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, our gross profit decreased $174 million to $1.794 billion, and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 38.1% from 40.6% primarily as a result of:\nBath & Body Works\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to higher distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales and investments in store real estate.\nThe gross profit rate decrease was primarily driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increases in supply chain and sourcing costs and the sales mix shift into the direct business, which has a lower merchandise margin rate than the stores channel.\nVictoria's Secret\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, the gross profit decrease was primarily driven by lower merchandise margin dollars related to the decrease in net sales and an increase in long-lived store asset impairment charges, from $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 to $45 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nThe gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increased promotions to drive traffic and clear inventory, the increase in long-lived store asset impairment charges and buying and occupancy deleverage on lower net sales.\nGeneral, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, our general, administrative and store operating expenses decreased $47 million to $1.022 billion due to the elimination of the La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses and lower marketing and store selling expenses at Victoria's Secret, partially offset by higher selling and marketing expenses related to higher sales volume at Bath & Body Works.\nThe general, administrative and store operating expense rate decreased to 21.7% from 22.0% driven by the absence of the higher-rate La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, our annual goodwill impairment assessment concluded that the carrying value of the Victoria's Secret reporting unit exceeded its fair value. Accordingly, we recognized a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $690 million in the Victoria's Secret segment.\nLoss on Divestiture of La Senza\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of La Senza of $99 million related to the recognition of $45 million of accumulated translation adjustments and the transfer of the net working capital and long-lived store assets to the buyer.\nOther Income (Loss) and Expense\nInterest Expense\nThe following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018:\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average daily borrowings (in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,880 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average borrowing rate (in percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, our interest expense decreased $1 million to $92 million due to lower average daily borrowings partially offset by a higher average borrowing rate.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, our effective tax rate declined compared to 24.0% in 2018. The 2019 rate varied from our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the Victoria's Secret goodwill impairment charge, which generated minimal tax benefit. The 2018 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the tax effects of the divestiture of the La Senza business.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining our financial stability. We are committed to maintaining adequate liquidity. Cash generated from our operating activities provides the primary resources to support current operations, growth initiatives, seasonal funding requirements and capital expenditures. Our cash provided from operations is impacted by our net income (loss) and working capital changes. Our net income (loss) is impacted by, among other things, sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, success of new product introductions, profit margins and income taxes. Historically, sales are higher during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, our need for working capital peaks during the summer and fall months as inventory builds in anticipation of the holiday period. Our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were $397 million as of January 30, 2021.\nCOVID-19 Response\nIn response to the global COVID-19 crisis, we took prudent actions to manage expenses and to maintain our solid cash position and financial flexibility. We:\n\u2022Furloughed most store associates as of April 5, 2020 during the temporary store closures, while continuing to provide healthcare benefits for eligible associates;\n\u2022Suspended associate merit increases;\n\u2022Temporarily reduced salaries for senior vice presidents and above by 20%;\n\u2022Temporarily suspended cash compensation for all members of the Board of Directors;\n\u2022Reduced fiscal 2020 capital expenditures from an original forecast of $550 million to $228 million;\n\u2022Actively managed inventory to adjust for the impact of channel shifts to meet customer demand;\n\u2022Temporarily suspended the quarterly cash dividend beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2020;\n\u2022Suspended many store and select office rent payments during the temporary closures. We completed negotiations with the majority of landlords, leading to a combination of rent waivers or abatements relating to closure periods, rent relief relating to the post-reopening recovery\u201d period given traffic declines, and rent deferrals;\n\u2022Converted the revolving credit facility to an asset-backed loan facility, issued $2.25 billion in new notes and extinguished $1.259 billion of notes primarily with near-term maturities; and\n\u2022Extended payment terms to vendors.\nAs of January 30, 2021, we had $3.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents with no outstanding borrowings on our ABL Facility. We believe that our available short-term and long-term capital resources are sufficient to fund foreseeable requirements.\nWorking Capital and Capitalization\nThe following table provides a summary of our working capital position and capitalization as of January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019:\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>January 30, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>February 1, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>February 2, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,377 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Expenditures </td> <td>228 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>458 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>629 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working Capital (a) </td> <td>2,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,274 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term Debt </td> <td>6,366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,739 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shareholders' Equity (Deficit) </td> <td>(662) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,499) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(869) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Capitalization </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,704 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,870 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts Available Under the Credit Agreement (b) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>981 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>991 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\n(a)The January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020 amounts include Current Operating Lease Liabilities as a result of our adoption of ASC 842, Leases, in the first quarter of 2019.\n(b)As of January 30, 2021, our borrowing base was $853 million but we were unable to draw upon the Credit Agreement as our consolidated cash balance exceeded $350 million.

The capital expenditures were primarily related to spending on technology and logistics to support our digital businesses and other retail capabilities. Capital expenditures of approximately $80 million related to the opening of new stores or the remodeling and improving of existing stores, primarily for Bath & Body Works.\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2019 was $480 million consisting primarily of $458 million of capital expenditures. The capital expenditures included $286 million for opening new stores and remodeling and improving existing stores. Remaining capital expenditures were primarily related to spending on technology and logistics to support our digital businesses and other retail capabilities.\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2018 was $609 million consisting primarily of $629 million of capital expenditures. The capital expenditures included $487 million for opening new stores and remodeling and improving existing stores. Remaining capital expenditures were primarily related to spending on technology and infrastructure to support growth.\nWe are estimating 2021 capital expenditures to be between $350 and $400 million. Approximately 60% of that forecast relates to Bath & Body Works, with the remaining 40% at Victoria's Secret. Bath & Body Works, while not fully returning to recent levels, is resuming its investment in the remodeling and opening of new stores. Additionally, we will be investing in technology, distribution and logistics capabilities for both businesses in 2021.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2020 was $610 million consisting primarily of net proceeds of $2.218 billion from the issuance of new notes, partially offset by $1.307 billion in payments for the early extinguishment of outstanding notes, $155 million of net repayments under our Foreign Facilities, dividend payments of $0.30 per share, or $83 million, and payments of finance lease obligations of $53 million. We also borrowed and repaid $950 million under our Credit Agreement during 2020.\nNet cash used for financing activities in 2019 was $666 million consisting primarily of $799 million in payments for the early extinguishment of outstanding notes, quarterly dividend payments of $1.20 per share, or $332 million, and tax payments related to share-based awards of $13 million. These were partially offset by the net proceeds of $486 million from the issuance of the 2029 Notes and $5 million of net new borrowings under our Foreign Facilities.\nNet cash used for financing activities in 2018 was $872 million consisting primarily of quarterly dividend payments totaling $2.40 per share, or $666 million, payments for repurchases of common stock of $198 million and payment of long-term debt related to our exchange of notes of $52 million, partially offset by $63 million of net new borrowings under our foreign facilities.\nCommon Stock Share Repurchases\nOur Board of Directors will determine share repurchase authorizations, giving consideration to our levels of profit and cash flow, capital requirements, current and forecasted liquidity, the restrictions placed upon us by our borrowing arrangements as well as financial and other conditions existing at the time. We use cash flow generated from operating and financing activities to fund our share repurchase programs. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be made at our discretion, taking into account a number of factors, including market conditions.\nIn March 2018, our Board of Directors approved a $250 million share repurchase program, which had $79 million remaining as of January 30, 2021. We did not repurchase any shares during 2020 or 2019.\nIn March 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a new $500 million share repurchase plan, which replaces the $79 million remaining under the March 2018 repurchase program. Pursuant to the Board's authorization, we entered into a Rule 10b5-1 purchase plan to effectuate share repurchases up to $250 million. Implementing the Rule 10b5-1 trading plan allows us to repurchase shares at times when we might otherwise be prevented from doing so by securities laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods.\nDividend Policy and Procedures\nOur Board of Directors will determine future dividends after giving consideration to our levels of profit and cash flow, capital requirements, current and forecasted liquidity, the restrictions placed upon us by our borrowing arrangements as well as financial and other conditions existing at the time. We use cash flow generated from operating and financing activities to fund our dividends.\nOur Board of Directors temporarily suspended our quarterly cash dividend beginning in the second quarter of 2020 as a proactive measure to strengthen our financial flexibility and manage through the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2021, our Board of Directors reinstated our annual dividend at $0.60 per share, beginning with the quarterly dividend to be paid in June 2021.\nUnder the authority and declaration of our Board of Directors, we paid the following dividends during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018: Table 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

\"2030 Notes\"). The obligation to pay principal and interest on these notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by us and certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries. The proceeds from the issuance were $988 million, which were net of issuance costs of $12 million. The issuance costs are being amortized through the maturity date and are included within Long-term Debt on the January 30, 2021 Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIn June 2020, we issued $750 million of 6.875% senior secured notes due July 2025 (the \"2025 Secured Notes\"). The obligation to pay principal and interest on these notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by us and certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries. The 2025 Secured Notes are secured on a first-priority lien basis by substantially all of our and the guarantors' assets, and on a second-priority lien basis by certain collateral securing the asset-backed revolving credit facility, in each case, subject to certain exceptions. The proceeds from the issuance were $738 million, which were net of issuance costs of $12 million. The issuance costs are being amortized through the maturity date and are included within Long-term Debt on the January 30, 2021 Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIn June 2020, we also issued $500 million of 9.375% notes due in July 2025 (the \"2025 Notes\"). The obligation to pay principal and interest on these notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by us and certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries. The proceeds from the issuance were $492 million, which were net of issuance costs of $8 million. The issuance costs are being amortized through the maturity date and are included within Long-term Debt on the January 30, 2021 Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIn June 2019, we issued $500 million of 7.50% notes due in June 2029 (the \"2029 Notes\"). The obligation to pay principal and interest on these notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by us and certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries. The proceeds from the issuance were $486 million, which were net of discounts and issuance costs of $14 million. The discounts and issuance costs are being amortized through the maturity date and are included within Long-term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRepurchases of Notes\nIn October 2020, we settled tender offers to repurchase $576 million of outstanding 2022 Notes, $180 million of outstanding 2023 Notes and $53 million of outstanding 2037 Notes for $844 million. We used the proceeds from the 2030 Notes to fund the purchase price of the tender offers. Additionally, utilizing cash on hand, we redeemed the remaining $450 million of outstanding 2021 Notes for $463 million. We recognized a pre-tax loss related to this extinguishment of debt of $53 million (after-tax loss of $40 million), which includes redemption fees and the write-offs of unamortized issuance costs. This loss is included in Other Income (Loss) in the 2020 Consolidated Statement of Income.\nIn June 2019, we completed the early settlement of tender offers to repurchase $212 million of outstanding 2020 Notes, $330 million of outstanding 2021 Notes and $96 million of outstanding 2022 Notes for $669 million. We used the proceeds from the 2029 Notes, together with cash on hand, to fund the purchase price for the tender offers. Additionally, in July 2019, we redeemed the remaining $126 million of outstanding 2020 Notes for $130 million. We recognized a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $40 million (after-tax loss of $30 million), which includes redemption fees and the write-off of unamortized issuance costs. This loss is included in Other Income (Loss) in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Loss.\nIn March 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a reduction in our debt that will be effected by a make whole call to repurchase the remaining $285 million of outstanding 2022 Notes and the $750 million of outstanding 2025 Secured Notes. This make whole call was issued on March 12, 2021 and we anticipate using approximately $1.1 billion in cash to complete the debt repurchase.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe and certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries guarantee and pledge collateral to secure a revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Agreement\"). In April 2020, we entered into an amendment and restatement (the \"Amendment\") of the Credit Agreement to convert our credit facility into an asset-backed revolving credit facility. The Amendment maintains the aggregate commitments at $1 billion, and maintains the expiration date in August of 2024. The ABL Facility allows borrowings and letters of credit in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars.\nAvailability under the ABL Facility is the lesser of (i) the borrowing base, determined primarily based on our eligible U.S. and Canadian credit card receivables, accounts receivable, inventory and eligible real property, or (ii) the aggregate commitment. If at any time, the outstanding amount under the ABL Facility exceeds the lesser of (i) the borrowing base and (ii) the aggregate commitment, we will be required to prepay the outstanding amounts under the ABL Facility to the extent of such excess. In addition, at any time that our consolidated cash balance exceeds $350 million, we will be required to prepay outstanding amounts under the ABL Facility to the extent of such excess. As of January 30, 2021, our borrowing base was $853 million but we were unable to draw upon the ABL Facility as our consolidated cash balance exceeded $350 million.\nThe ABL Facility supports our letter of credit program. We had $63 million of outstanding letters of credit as of January 30, 2021 that reduced our availability under the ABL Facility.\nAs of January 30, 2021, the ABL Facility fees related to committed and unutilized amounts were 0.30% per annum, and the fees related to outstanding letters of credit were 1.75% per annum. In addition, the interest rate on outstanding U.S. dollar borrowings was the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") plus 1.75% per annum. The interest rate on outstanding Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings was the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (\"CDOR\") plus 1.75% per annum.\nThe ABL Facility requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00 during an event of default or any period commencing on any day when specified excess availability is less than the greater of (1) $100 million or (2) 15% of the maximum borrowing amount. As of January 30, 2021, we were not required to maintain this ratio.\nIn March 2020, in an abundance of caution and as a proactive measure in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we elected to borrow $950 million from our revolving facility, which was repaid upon the completion of the Amendment. As of January 30, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility.\nForeign Facilities\nCertain of our China subsidiaries utilize revolving and term loan bank facilities to support their operations (the \"Foreign Facilities\"). The Foreign Facilities allow borrowings in U.S. dollars and Chinese Yuan, and interest rates on outstanding borrowings are based upon the applicable benchmark rate for the currency of each borrowing. Certain of these facilities are guaranteed by us and certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries (the \"Secured Foreign Facilities\").\nAs of January 30, 2021, the Secured Foreign Facilities allow for borrowings and letters of credit up to $30 million. During 2020, we borrowed $21 million and made payments of $126 million under the Secured Foreign Facilities. As of January 30, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Secured Foreign Facilities.\nDuring 2020, we placed cash on deposit with certain financial institutions as collateral for their lending commitments under the Secured Foreign Facilities. As of January 30, 2021, the amount of collateral required was dependent upon the aggregate\nlending commitments. These deposits, totaling $30 million, are recorded in Other Assets on the January 30, 2021 Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nDuring 2020, we borrowed $13 million and made payments of $63 million under the unsecured Foreign Facilities. During the second quarter of 2020, with no borrowings outstanding, we terminated the unsecured Foreign Facilities.\nCredit Ratings\nThe following table provides our credit ratings as of January 30, 2021:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Moody's </td> <td> </td> <td>S&P </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Secured Debt </td> <td>Ba2 </td> <td> </td> <td>BB </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate </td> <td>B2 </td> <td> </td> <td>B+ </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Unsecured Debt with Subsidiary Guarantee </td> <td>B2 </td> <td> </td> <td>B+ </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Unsecured Debt </td> <td>Caa1 </td> <td> </td> <td>B- </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outlook </td> <td>Positive </td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubsequent to January 30, 2021, S&P upgraded our Senior Secured Debt rating to BB+, our Corporate and Senior Unsecured Debt with Subsidiary Guarantee ratings to BB- and our Senior Unsecured Debt rating to B, and issued a Stable outlook at these updated ratings.\nGuarantor Summarized Financial Information\nCertain of our subsidiaries, which are listed on Exhibit 22 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, have guaranteed our obligations under the 2022 Notes, 2023 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2028 Notes, 2029 Notes, 2030 Notes, 2035 Notes and the 2036 Notes (collectively, the \"Unsecured Notes\") and the 2025 Secured Notes (the Secured Notes\u201d and together with the Unsecured Notes, the Notes\u201d).\nThe Notes have been issued by L Brands, Inc. (the Parent Company\u201d). The Unsecured Notes are its senior unsecured obligations and the Secured Notes are its senior secured obligations. The Unsecured Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured obligations, senior to any of our future subordinated indebtedness, are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future indebtedness that is secured by a lien and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of each of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Unsecured Notes. The Secured Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior obligations, senior to any of our future subordinated indebtedness, are effectively senior to all of our existing and future indebtedness that is secured by a lien on collateral that ranks junior to the lien on such collateral securing the Secured Notes, are effectively senior to all of our existing and future unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing the Secured Notes, are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future indebtedness that is secured by a lien on assets that do not constitute collateral or that is secured by a first-priority lien on certain collateral, in each case to the extent of the value of such assets, and structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of each of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Unsecured Notes.\nThe Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, including each subsidiary that also guarantees our obligations under certain of our senior secured credit facilities (such guarantees, the Guarantees\u201d; and, such guaranteeing subsidiaries, the Subsidiary Guarantors\u201d). The Guarantees of the Subsidiary Guarantors are subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. Each Guarantee is limited, by its terms, to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law.\nThe following tables set forth summarized financial information for the Parent Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the Parent Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors and (ii) investments in and equity in the earnings of non-Guarantor subsidiaries:\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SUMMARIZED BALANCE SHEETS </td> <td>January 30,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>February 1,\n2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ASSETS </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current Assets (a) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,813 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,728 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncurrent Assets (b) </td> <td>4,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,357 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LIABILITIES </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current Liabilities (c) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,038 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,163 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncurrent Liabilities (d) </td> <td>9,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,772 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n(a)Includes amounts due from non-Guarantor subsidiaries of $1.933 billion and $1.091 billion as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively.\n(b)Includes amounts due from non-Guarantor subsidiaries of $141 million as of January 30, 2021.\n(c)Includes amounts due to non-Guarantor subsidiaries of $3.096 billion and $2.684 billion as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively.\n(d)Includes amounts due to non-Guarantor subsidiaries of $476 million as of both January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020.\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SUMMARIZED STATEMENT OF INCOME </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales (a) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,404 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,424 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,420 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Before Income Taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>694 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income (b) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>513 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n(a)Includes net sales of $608 million to non-Guarantor subsidiaries.\n(b)Includes net loss of $49 million related to transactions with non-Guarantor subsidiaries.\nIn addition to the Subsidiary Guarantors, a certain subsidiary, which is listed on Exhibit 22 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has only guaranteed our obligations under the 2025 Notes, 2025 Secured Notes and 2030 Notes. This subsidiary had assets, all of which were noncurrent, of $235 million and $244 million as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively. In addition, this subsidiary had current liabilities of $119 million as of February 1, 2020, which included $93 million due to the Subsidiary Guarantors. The 2020 Statement of Income activity for this subsidiary is immaterial.\nContingent Liabilities and Contractual Obligations\nThe following table provides our contractual obligations, aggregated by type, including the maturity profile as of January 30, 2021:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less\nThan 1\nYear </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td>4-5\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td>More\nthan 5\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td>Other </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term Debt (a) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,957 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>449 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,659 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Future Lease Obligations (b) </td> <td>4,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>915 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Obligations (c) </td> <td>1,227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Liabilities (d) (e) </td> <td>354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,032 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\n(a)Long-term debt obligations relate to our principal and interest payments for outstanding notes and debentures. Interest payments have been estimated based on the coupon rate for fixed rate obligations. Interest obligations exclude amounts\nwhich have been accrued through January 30, 2021. For additional information, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n(b)Future lease obligations primarily represent minimum payments due under store lease agreements. For additional information, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n(c)Purchase obligations primarily include purchase orders for merchandise inventory and other agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions.\n(d)Other liabilities include future payments relating to our non-qualified supplemental retirement plan of $166 million in the \"Less Than 1 Year\" category. For additional information, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n(e)Other liabilities also include future estimated payments associated with unrecognized tax benefits. The Less Than 1 Year\u201d category includes $122 million of these tax items because it is reasonably possible that the amounts could change in the next 12 months due to audit settlements or resolution of uncertainties. The remaining portion totaling $25 million is included in the Other\u201d category as it is not reasonably possible that the amounts could change in the next 12 months. In addition, we have a remaining liability of $41 million related to the deemed repatriation tax on our undistributed foreign earnings resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The tax liability will be paid over the next four years. For additional information, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nLa Senza\nIn connection with the sale of La Senza in the fourth quarter of 2018, certain of our subsidiaries have remaining contingent obligations of $32 million related to lease payments under the current terms of noncancelable leases expiring at various dates through 2028. These obligations include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of the business. As of January 30, 2021, we recorded reserves of $35 million, primarily included within Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, related to these lease-related obligations and certain other obligations related to the La Senza business.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by Regulation 229.303 Item 303 (a) (4).\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nCredit Losses\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which requires the use of a forward-looking expected loss impairment model for accounts receivable and certain other financial instruments. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nGuarantor Reporting\nIn March 2020, the SEC issued a final rule, Financial Disclosures About Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities and Affiliates Whose Securities Collateralize a Registrant's Securities, that simplifies the disclosure requirements related to registered securities under Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X. The rule replaces the requirement to provide condensed consolidating financial information with a requirement to present summarized financial information of the issuers and guarantors. It also requires qualitative disclosures with respect to information about guarantors, the terms and conditions of guarantees and the factors that may affect payment. These disclosures may be provided outside the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements. We early adopted the reporting requirements of the rule in the first quarter of 2020 and elected to provide these disclosures in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nImpact of Inflation\nWhile it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, long-lived assets, claims and contingencies, income taxes and revenue recognition. Management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position.\nInventories\nInventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, on an average cost basis.\nWe record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These estimates are based on management's judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience. If actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management, future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates.\nWe also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory. These estimates are based on management's analysis of historical results and operating trends.\nManagement believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate. A 10% increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately $5 million for 2020. A 10% increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately $4 million for 2020.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets\nLong-lived Store Assets\nLong-lived store assets, which include leasehold improvements, store related assets and operating lease assets (subsequent to the adoption of ASC 842, Leases), are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Store assets are grouped at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of other assets or asset groups. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset group are less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value, determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset group. For operating lease assets, we determine the fair value of the assets by comparing the contractual rent payments to estimated market rental rates. An individual asset within an asset group is not impaired below its estimated fair value. The fair value of long-lived store assets are determined using Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.\nIn 2020, we executed a rationalization of the Victoria's Secret company-operated store footprint. We permanently closed 241 stores in North America in 2020. Given the closures in 2020 as well as the negative operating results of certain Victoria's Secret stores in 2020, 2019 and 2018, we reviewed the long-lived store assets for potential impairment in all periods presented. We determined that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying values for certain Victoria's Secret asset groups and, as a result, determined the estimated fair values of the store asset groups using estimated discounted future cash flows and estimated market rental rates.\nThe following table provides pre-tax long-lived store asset impairment charges included in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) for 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Store Asset Impairment </td> <td>$ </td> <td>136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Lease Asset Impairment </td> <td>118 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Impairment </td> <td>$ </td> <td>254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur fair value estimates incorporated significant assumptions and judgments including, but not limited to, estimated future cash flows, discount rates and market rental rates. The use of different assumptions or judgments in our assessment could materially\nincrease or decrease the fair value of our store assets and, accordingly, could materially increase or decrease any related impairment charge. Sustained declines in our business performance could result in a material impairment charge in a future period.\nWhen a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life, depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. We have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that each reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value (including goodwill), or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value (including goodwill). If we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Our reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. During 2019, we impaired the goodwill at the Victoria's Secret and Victoria's Secret Greater China reporting units, resulting in pre-tax impairment charges of $720 million. As a result, only the Bath & Body Works reporting unit has goodwill as of January 30, 2021.\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment over the Bath & Body Works reporting unit. We performed a qualitative assessment and determined that the Bath & Body Works reporting unit's fair value was greater than its carrying value (including goodwill). Declines in our market capitalization or in our business performance could result in a material impairment charge in a future period.\nTrade Names\nThe Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret trade names are intangible assets with indefinite lives. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. We have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. To determine if the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount, we will estimate the fair value, usually determined by the relief from royalty method under the income approach, and compare that value with its carrying amount. If the carrying value of the trade name exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference.\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed our annual impairment assessments of the Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret trade names. To estimate the fair value of the trade names, we used the relief from royalty method under the income approach. The annual assessments concluded that the fair values of the trade names were in excess of their respective carrying values.\nThe use of different assumptions or judgments in our impairment assessment of our trade names, including with respect to the estimated future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount such estimated future cash flows to their net present value and royalty rates used for the relief from royalty method, could materially increase or decrease the fair value of our trade names. A 50% reduction to our assumed royalty rate would not have resulted in a material impairment charge in 2020.\nClaims and Contingencies\nWe are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, insurance, regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. Our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements is based on management's view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency. We consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. We accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible (as opposed to probable) or if an estimate is not reasonably determinable, disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In determining our provision for income taxes, we consider permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates. Our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings.\nWe follow the authoritative guidance included in ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may differ from forecasted outcomes. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\nOur income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual, when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue based on the amount we expect to receive when control of the goods or services is transferred to our customer. We recognize sales upon customer receipt of merchandise, which for direct channel revenues reflect an estimate of shipments that have not yet been received by our customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times. Our shipping and handling revenues are included in Net Sales with the related costs included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy in our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). We also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience. Net Sales exclude sales and other similar taxes collected from customers.\nWe offer certain loyalty programs that allow customers to earn points based on purchasing activity. As customers accumulate points and reach point thresholds, they can use the points to purchase merchandise in stores or online. We allocate revenue to points earned on qualifying purchases and defer recognition until the points are redeemed. The amount of revenue deferred is based on the relative stand-alone selling price method, which includes an estimate for points not expected to be redeemed based on historical experience.\nWe sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers. We do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards. We recognize revenue from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer. In addition, we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards where the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions (gift card breakage). Gift card breakage revenue is recognized in proportion, and over the same period, as actual gift card redemptions. We determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns. Gift card breakage is included in Net Sales in our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).\nRevenue earned in connection with Victoria's Secret's private label credit card arrangement is primarily recognized based on credit card sales and usage and is included in Net Sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).\nWe also recognize revenues associated with franchise, license, wholesale and sourcing arrangements. Revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers. Revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner.", "summary": "The report provides a detailed analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") as codified in the Accounting Standards Codification. The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOur operating results are generally impacted by economic changes and, therefore, we monitor the retail environment using, among other things, certain key industry performance indicators including competitor performance and mall traffic data. These can provide insight into consumer spending patterns and shopping behavior in the current retail environment and assist us in assessing our performance as well as the potential impact of industry trends on our future operating results. Additionally, we evaluate a number of key performance indicators including comparable sales, gross profit, operating income and other performance metrics such as sales per average selling square foot and inventory per selling square foot in assessing our performance.\nCOVID-19\nIn March 2020, the spread of COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. This pandemic has negatively affected the U.S. and global economies, disrupted global supply chains and financial markets, and led to significant travel and transportation restrictions, including mandatory closures and orders to shelter-in-place.\u201d The actions that governments around the world have taken to contain the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in a period of disruption, including closure of our stores, limited store operating hours, reduced customer traffic and consumer spending and delays in manufacturing and shipping of products and raw materials. During this period, we are focused on protecting the health and safety of our customers, employees, contractors, suppliers and other business partners. We are also working with our suppliers to minimize potential disruptions, while managing our business in response to a changing dynamic.\nOur business operations and financial performance for 2020 were materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. All of our stores in North America were closed on March 17, 2020 but we were able to re-open the majority of our stores as of the beginning of the third quarter. Operations for Victoria's Secret Direct were temporarily suspended for approximately one week in late March 2020, while Bath & Body Works Direct remained open for the duration of fiscal 2020. Additionally, we have dedicated resources to maximize capacity in our direct fulfillment centers to meet increased customer demand, while focusing on distribution, fulfillment and call center safety. There remains a high level of uncertainty around the pandemic and the potential for further restrictions.\nSegments\nIn the third quarter of 2020, we changed our segment reporting as a result of leadership changes and restructuring actions taken to facilitate the ongoing efforts to separate Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret into separate businesses. We now have two reportable segments: Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret. Accordingly, we will no longer report a Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International segment as these businesses are now included with their respective brand. Additionally, the Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret segments now include sourcing and production functions (formerly known as Mast) and certain other corporate functions that directly support each brand. These functions were previously included within Other. While this reporting change did not impact our consolidated results, the segment data has been recast to be consistent for all periods presented.\nExecutive Overview\nThe pandemic had a profound impact on the retail industry and our business. In response, we led with our values and an emphasis on safety, so we could be confident in our decisions and actions to support associates, customers, partners and our businesses. Accordingly, we adopted new operating models in our stores focused on providing a safe environment, while also delivering an engaging shopping experience. Additionally, we remain focused on the safe operations of our distribution, fulfillment and call centers while maximizing our direct channels. We implemented cost reduction and performance improvements at Victoria's Secret, while continuing to drive substantial growth at Bath & Body Works and improved performance at Victoria's Secret.\nWe are committed to establishing our Bath & Body Works business as a pure-play public company and are taking the necessary steps to prepare the Victoria's Secret business, including PINK, to operate as a separate standalone company. Our Board of Directors is currently evaluating all options, including a potential spin-off of the Victoria's Secret business into a public company or a private sale of the business.\nDuring 2020, we took a number of important steps to improve performance at Victoria's Secret and to prepare Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret to operate as separate standalone companies, including:\n\u2022Retaining Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan as financial advisors on the separation of Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret;\n\u2022Completing a comprehensive review of our home office organizations in order to achieve meaningful reductions in overhead expenses and decentralize significant shared functions and services to support the creation of standalone companies. This resulted in a reduction of our home office headcount by approximately 15%, or about 850 associates;\n\u2022Executing our previously announced plan to permanently close 241 Victoria's Secret stores in the U.S. and Canada while also negotiating with landlords for ongoing rent relief;\n\u2022Closing the unprofitable Hong Kong flagship store, restructuring lease terms on the two mainland China flagship stores and implementing a significant overhead expense reduction plan; and\n\u2022Managing inventories with discipline, including working with suppliers to identify opportunities to reduce merchandise costs in order to increase merchandise margin rates at Victoria's Secret and PINK.\nWe expect to deliver $400 million of annual savings under our profit improvement plan outlined above, which was implemented at the beginning of the third quarter. Roughly half of the savings were realized in the back half of fiscal 2020, principally at Victoria's Secret, with the remainder expected to be realized in the first half of fiscal 2021.\nGrowth Strategy\nWe have a multi-year goal to increase sales and operating income by focusing on these key business priorities:\n\u2022Grow our business in North America;\n\u2022Extend our brand internationally; and\n\u2022Focus on the fundamentals of our business.\nWe also continue to focus on:\n\u2022Attracting and retaining top talent;\n\u2022Maintaining a strong cash and liquidity position while optimizing our capital structure; and\n\u2022Returning value to our shareholders.\nThe following is a discussion regarding certain of our key business priorities:\nGrow our business in North America\nWe see opportunities for meaningful growth in all our categories by focusing on product newness and innovation and expanding into under-penetrated markets and price segments. We will continue to invest in the Bath & Body Works White Barn store design, which continues to yield strong results. In 2021, we are forecasting approximately 50 new Bath & Body Works North America stores, almost entirely off-mall, partially offset by about 20 to 40 closures, principally in malls, resulting in net square footage growth of 3% to 4%.\nWe are focused on continued innovation and enhancements to our digital platforms and applications, and development of omni-channel capabilities that integrate our online presence with our stores. During 2020, we tested BOPIS at certain of our Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret stores and expect to continue improving our online and in-store BOPIS experience during 2021.\nExtend our brand internationally\nWe believe there is substantial opportunity for international growth. We have separate, dedicated teams that have taken a methodical, \"test and learn\" approach to expansion. We plan to expand our presence outside of North America by increasing the number of stores operated by our international partners.\nOur partners opened 10 net new Bath & Body Works stores in 2020, bringing the total in the Middle East, Latin America, Southeast Asia and Europe to 288 stores. Additionally, our partners opened 16 new international digital sites. Our partners plan to open another 50 to 70 new international stores, increasing our store count by 15% to 23%, in 2021.\nAt Victoria's Secret in 2021, our partners will continue to expand international digital operations with the opening of another 20 websites. Additionally, in 2020, we entered into a joint venture with Next PLC for the Victoria's Secret business in the U.K. and Ireland. We believe Next's capabilities and experience in the U.K. market will provide meaningful growth opportunities for the business.\nFocus on the fundamentals of our business\nWe are focused on the fundamentals of our business which include knowing our customers, focusing on core merchandise categories, inventory management, speed and agility, managing real estate and store selling and execution. In terms of speed and agility, we are focused on inventory discipline through lead-time reductions and in-season agility to increase sales and reduce promotional activity. In terms of real estate, we will continue to proactively and rigorously review our portfolio, and we will continue to open and close stores when we believe it makes sense to do so. We continue to optimize our store selling and execution by concentrating on a better store experience and developing, retaining and investing in talented, trained and productive store associates. In the direct businesses, we continue to focus on ensuring a positive customer experience on our websites and developing our fulfillment capacity in order to provide delivery times that meet our customer's needs.\n2020 Overview\nDespite operating in the COVID-19 environment, both our segments were able to meaningfully improve performance, driven primarily by strong growth in our direct channels. 2020 net sales were $11.847 billion, and total comparable sales increased 21%. The gross profit rate increased 490 basis points to 39.4%, driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate. General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses declined 11% and leveraged approximately 80 basis points. The dollar decline was driven by our profit improvement plan and the closure of 248 Victoria's Secret stores. Operating income for the full year increased $1.322 billion to $1.580 billion driven by merchandise margin growth at Bath & Body Works, savings realized on our profit improvement plan and Victoria's Secret goodwill impairment charges of $720 million recorded in 2019. The total company operating income rate increased to 13.3% in 2020 from 2.0% last year.\nFor the Bath & Body Works segment, net sales grew by 20%, or $1.078 billion, to $6.434 billion and total comparable sales increased 45%. Store comparable sales increased 26% and our direct channel grew sales by 109%. Our store sales were roughly flat to last year at $4.207 billion, despite the fact that the majority of stores were closed for roughly 3 months. We surpassed the $2 billion mark in the direct channel with full-year sales of $2.003 billion in 2020. Segment operating income for 2020 was $1.821 billion, up 49% compared to last year, and the operating income rate was 28.3%, an increase of 540 basis points compared to last year.\nFor the Victoria's Secret segment, net sales declined by 28%, or $2.096 billion, to $5.413 billion, and total comparable sales increased 1%. Store comparable sales declined 15% and our direct channel grew sales by 31%. Our North America store sales were down 45%, or $2.317 billion, to last year. Store sales were negatively impacted by the temporary COVID-19-related closures, declines in store traffic, particularly constrained on high volume Holiday days, occupancy restrictions and the impact of the 241 North American stores that were permanently closed. Sales in the direct channel were $2.223 billion, up 31% to last year despite a temporary suspension of operations in March 2020. International revenue declined by $309 million in 2020, or 44%, driven by pandemic related store closures and the exclusion of U.K. retail sales due to the establishment of the joint venture with Next. Segment operating loss decreased by $757 million to $25 million in 2020, primarily driven by the benefits of our profit improvement plan and by goodwill impairment charges of $720 million recorded in 2019, partially offset by the impact of store closures as a result of the pandemic in the first half of the year.\nFor additional information related to our 2020 financial performance, see Results of Operations - 2020 Compared to 2019.\u201d\nImpacts of COVID-19\nIn response to the global COVID-19 crisis, we took prudent actions to manage expenses and to maintain our solid cash position and financial flexibility. We:\n\u2022Furloughed most store associates as of April 5, 2020 during the temporary store closures, while continuing to provide healthcare benefits for eligible associates;\n\u2022Suspended associate merit increases;\n\u2022Temporarily reduced salaries for senior vice presidents and above by 20%;\n\u2022Temporarily suspended cash compensation for all members of the Board of Directors;\n\u2022Reduced fiscal 2020 capital expenditures from an original forecast of $550 million to $228 million;\n\u2022Actively managed inventory to adjust for the impact of channel shifts to meet customer demand;\n\u2022Temporarily suspended the quarterly cash dividend beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2020;\n\u2022Suspended many store and select office rent payments during the temporary closures. We completed negotiations with the majority of landlords, leading to a combination of rent waivers or abatements relating to closure periods, rent relief relating to the post-reopening recovery\u201d period given traffic declines, and rent deferrals;\n\u2022Converted the revolving credit facility to an asset-backed loan facility, issued $2.25 billion in new notes and extinguished $1.259 billion of notes primarily with near-term maturities; and\n\u2022Extended payment terms to vendors.\nAs of January 30, 2021, we had $3.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents with no outstanding borrowings on our ABL Facility.\nAdjusted Financial Information\nIn addition to our results provided in accordance with GAAP above and throughout this Form 10-K, provided below are non-GAAP measurements which present operating income, net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share in 2020, 2019 and 2018 on an adjusted basis, which remove certain special items. We believe that these special items are not indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and nature. We use adjusted financial information as key performance measures of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Instead, we believe that the presentation of adjusted financial information provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. Further, our definition of adjusted financial information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. The table below reconciles the GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures.\n ________________\n(a)We recognized pre-tax impairment charges of $97 million ($72 million after tax) and $117 million ($99 million after tax) related to certain Victoria's Secret store and lease assets in the first and second quarter of 2020, respectively.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n(d)In the third quarter of 2020, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $30 million ($27 million after tax) related to the establishment of a joint venture for the Victoria's Secret U.K. and Ireland business with Next PLC. For additional information, see Note 5, Restructuring Activities\" included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n(e)In the fourth quarter of 2019, we recognized a $690 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge ($687 million after-tax) related to the Victoria's Secret reporting unit. In the third quarter of 2019, we recognized a $30 million goodwill impairment charge (no tax impact) related to the Victoria's Secret Greater China reporting unit. For additional information see Note 9, \"Goodwill and Trade Names\" included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n(f)In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a $99 million ($55 million after-tax) loss on the sale of La Senza. For additional information see Note 5, \"Restructuring Activities\" included in Item 8.

For additional information see Note 5, \"Restructuring Activities\" included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n(h)In the third quarter of 2020, we early extinguished $1.259 billion of outstanding notes, resulting in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of $53 million (after-tax loss of $40 million). In the second quarter of 2019, we redeemed $764 million of outstanding notes, resulting in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of $40 million (after-tax loss of $30 million). For additional information see Note 13, \"Long-term Debt and Borrowing Facilities\" included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n(i)In the third quarter of 2019, we recognized $37 million of pre-tax charges ($28 million after-tax) to increase reserves related to ongoing contingent obligations for the La Senza business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2018.

In the second quarter of 2020, we recognized a $21 million income tax benefit related to recent changes in tax legislation included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\"). In the first quarter of 2020, we recognized a $50 million tax benefit related to the resolution of certain tax matters. For additional information see Note 12, \"Income Taxes\" included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n2021 Outlook\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we expect our operating performance to increase significantly compared to last year. The remainder of the year will present more challenging comparisons to last year, although we do expect growth versus 2019. We experienced record productivity and strong growth online in 2020. In 2020, Bath & Body Works grew operating income by $153 million, or 84%, in the second quarter, by $285 million, or 137%, in the third quarter and by $250 million, or 38%, in the fourth quarter. Strong demand allowed us to significantly pull back on promotional activity, and the 2020 operating income rate was 28.3%.\nWe believe an operating margin in the low to mid-twenties is appropriate for the current Bath & Body Works segment, which reflects the right value/quality proposition for our customers, as well as the right level of investment in product innovation, quality and engaging, best-in-class store and online experiences. We will continue to focus on maximizing our performance, leveraging the strength of our brand, our close connection to our customers and the speed we have in our supply chain, and we have confidence in our opportunities for long-term growth.\nIn the Victoria's Secret business, we believe we have opportunities for continued improved performance, particularly in the first half of the year, driven by improved assortments, more disciplined inventory management, our profit improvement plan and lapping 2020 pandemic related store closures. We have long-term opportunities for growth in the Victoria's Secret business, which continues to lead the lingerie market, and are targeting a 10-15% operating margin.\nWe caution there is ongoing uncertainty in the current environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as an impending separation of the Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret businesses, which we are targeting to complete in August 2021. Over the next 6 months, we will continue to work toward the separation of the two businesses, proceeding down a dual track to prepare for either a spin-off or a sale.\nCompany-Operated Store Data\nThe following table compares 2020 company-operated store data to the comparable periods for 2019 and 2018:\n\n________________\n(a)Sales per average selling square foot and sales per average store, which are indicators of store productivity, are calculated based on store sales for the period divided by the average, including the beginning and end of period, of total square footage and store count, respectively. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, all our stores in the U.S. were closed on March 17, 2020 with the majority having been re-opened as of the beginning of the third quarter. As a result, comparisons of 2020 trends to prior years is not a meaningful way to discuss our operating results.\nThe following table represents company-operated store data for 2020:\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") as codified in the Accounting Standards Codification. The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOur operating results are generally impacted by economic changes and, therefore, we monitor the retail environment using, among other things, certain key industry performance indicators including competitor performance and mall traffic data. These can provide insight into consumer spending patterns and shopping behavior in the current retail environment and assist us in assessing our performance as well as the potential impact of industry trends on our future operating results. Additionally, we evaluate a number of key performance indicators including comparable sales, gross profit, operating income and other performance metrics such as sales per average selling square foot and inventory per selling square foot in assessing our performance.\nCOVID-19\nIn March 2020, the spread of COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. This pandemic has negatively affected the U.S. and global economies, disrupted global supply chains and financial markets, and led to significant travel and transportation restrictions, including mandatory closures and orders to shelter-in-place.\u201d The actions that governments around the world have taken to contain the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in a period of disruption, including closure of our stores, limited store operating hours, reduced customer traffic and consumer spending and delays in manufacturing and shipping of products and raw materials. During this period, we are focused on protecting the health and safety of our customers, employees, contractors, suppliers and other business partners. We are also working with our suppliers to minimize potential disruptions, while managing our business in response to a changing dynamic.\nOur business operations and financial performance for 2020 were materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. All of our stores in North America were closed on March 17, 2020 but we were able to re-open the majority of our stores as of the beginning of the third quarter. Operations for Victoria's Secret Direct were temporarily suspended for approximately one week in late March 2020, while Bath & Body Works Direct remained open for the duration of fiscal 2020. Additionally, we have dedicated resources to maximize capacity in our direct fulfillment centers to meet increased customer demand, while focusing on distribution, fulfillment and call center safety. There remains a high level of uncertainty around the pandemic and the potential for further restrictions.\nSegments\nIn the third quarter of 2020, we changed our segment reporting as a result of leadership changes and restructuring actions taken to facilitate the ongoing efforts to separate Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret into separate businesses. We now have two reportable segments: Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret. Accordingly, we will no longer report a Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International segment as these businesses are now included with their respective brand. Additionally, the Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret segments now include sourcing and production functions (formerly known as Mast) and certain other corporate functions that directly support each brand. These functions were previously included within Other. While this reporting change did not impact our consolidated results, the segment data has been recast to be consistent for all periods presented.\nExecutive Overview\nThe pandemic had a profound impact on the retail industry and our business. In response, we led with our values and an emphasis on safety, so we could be confident in our decisions and actions to support associates, customers, partners and our businesses. Accordingly, we adopted new operating models in our stores focused on providing a safe environment, while also delivering an engaging shopping experience. Additionally, we remain focused on the safe operations of our distribution, fulfillment and call centers while maximizing our direct channels. We implemented cost reduction and performance improvements at Victoria's Secret, while continuing to drive substantial growth at Bath & Body Works and improved performance at Victoria's Secret.\nWe are committed to establishing our Bath & Body Works business as a pure-play public company and are taking the necessary steps to prepare the Victoria's Secret business, including PINK, to operate as a separate standalone company.

Roughly half of the savings were realized in the back half of fiscal 2020, principally at Victoria's Secret, with the remainder expected to be realized in the first half of fiscal 2021.\nGrowth Strategy\nWe have a multi-year goal to increase sales and operating income by focusing on these key business priorities:\n\u2022Grow our business in North America;\n\u2022Extend our brand internationally; and\n\u2022Focus on the fundamentals of our business.\nWe also continue to focus on:\n\u2022Attracting and retaining top talent;\n\u2022Maintaining a strong cash and liquidity position while optimizing our capital structure; and\n\u2022Returning value to our shareholders.\nThe following is a discussion regarding certain of our key business priorities:\nGrow our business in North America\nWe see opportunities for meaningful growth in all our categories by focusing on product newness and innovation and expanding into under-penetrated markets and price segments.

Additionally, in 2020, we entered into a joint venture with Next PLC for the Victoria's Secret business in the U.K. and Ireland. We believe Next's capabilities and experience in the U.K. market will provide meaningful growth opportunities for the business.\nFocus on the fundamentals of our business\nWe are focused on the fundamentals of our business which include knowing our customers, focusing on core merchandise categories, inventory management, speed and agility, managing real estate and store selling and execution.

The remainder of the year will present more challenging comparisons to last year, although we do expect growth versus 2019. We experienced record productivity and strong growth online in 2020. In 2020, Bath & Body Works grew operating income by $153 million, or 84%, in the second quarter, by $285 million, or 137%, in the third quarter and by $250 million, or 38%, in the fourth quarter. Strong demand allowed us to significantly pull back on promotional activity, and the 2020 operating income rate was 28.3%.\nWe believe an operating margin in the low to mid-twenties is appropriate for the current Bath & Body Works segment, which reflects the right value/quality proposition for our customers, as well as the right level of investment in product innovation, quality and engaging, best-in-class store and online experiences. We will continue to focus on maximizing our performance, leveraging the strength of our brand, our close connection to our customers and the speed we have in our supply chain, and we have confidence in our opportunities for long-term growth.\nIn the Victoria's Secret business, we believe we have opportunities for continued improved performance, particularly in the first half of the year, driven by improved assortments, more disciplined inventory management, our profit improvement plan and lapping 2020 pandemic related store closures. We have long-term opportunities for growth in the Victoria's Secret business, which continues to lead the lingerie market, and are targeting a 10-15% operating margin.\nWe caution there is ongoing uncertainty in the current environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as an impending separation of the Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret businesses, which we are targeting to complete in August 2021. Over the next 6 months, we will continue to work toward the separation of the two businesses, proceeding down a dual track to prepare for either a spin-off or a sale.\nCompany-Operated Store Data\nThe following table compares 2020 company-operated store data to the comparable periods for 2019 and 2018:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales per Average Selling Square Foot (a) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bath & Body Works U.S. </td> <td>$ </td> <td>916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>891 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Victoria's Secret U.S. </td> <td>415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>684 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td>(7 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales per Average Store (in thousands) (a) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bath & Body Works U.S. </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Victoria's Secret U.S. </td> <td>2,789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td>(6 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Store Size (selling square feet) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bath & Body Works U.S. </td> <td>2,660 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Victoria's Secret U.S. </td> <td>6,928 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Selling Square Feet (in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bath & Body Works U.S. </td> <td>4,343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Victoria's Secret U.S. </td> <td>5,861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,898 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td>(3 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\n(a)Sales per average selling square foot and sales per average store, which are indicators of store productivity, are calculated based on store sales for the period divided by the average, including the beginning and end of period, of total square footage and store count, respectively.
