MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the Section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A, and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nBusiness Overview\nWe are a molecular diagnostics company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of clinically differentiated, high-value diagnostic surveillance solutions for transplant patients. Our first commercialized testing solution, the AlloMap heart transplant molecular test, or AlloMap, is a gene expression test that helps clinicians monitor and identify heart transplant recipients with stable graft function who have a low probability of moderate/severe acute cellular rejection. Since 2008, we have sought to expand the adoption and utilization of our AlloMap solution through ongoing studies to substantiate the clinical utility and actionability of AlloMap, secure positive reimbursement decisions for AlloMap from large private and public payers, develop and enhance our relationships with key members of the transplant community, including opinion leaders at major transplant centers, and explore opportunities and technologies for the development of additional solutions for post-transplant surveillance. We believe the use of AlloMap, in conjunction with other clinical indicators, can help healthcare providers and their patients better manage long-term care following a heart transplant. In particular, we believe AlloMap can improve patient care by helping healthcare providers to avoid the use of unnecessary, invasive surveillance biopsies and to determine the appropriate dosage levels of immunosuppressants. We are also pursuing the development of additional products for transplant monitoring using a variety of technologies, including AlloSure, our next-generation sequencing-based test to detect donor-derived cell-free DNA, or dd-cfDNA after transplantation.\nSince the launch of AlloMap in January 2005 we have performed more than 81,000 commercial AlloMap tests, including 13,000 tests in 2015, in our Brisbane, California laboratory. In 2015, the test was used in 120 of the approximately 130 heart transplant management centers in the U.S. We believe that there is an opportunity for AlloMap outside of the U.S. and through recent partnerships we have expanded the AlloMap offering to Europe. We believe that we are not currently capacity constrained and that our current facility can support a substantial increase in AlloMap testing volume.\nReimbursement for AlloMap tests comes primarily from Medicare, private third party payers such as insurance companies and managed care organizations, hospitals and state Medicaid programs. Tests performed on patients covered by Medicare represented 36%, 37% and 39% of all AlloMap tests in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. A number of payers have adopted coverage policies approving AlloMap tests for reimbursement. Such policies often approve reimbursement for tests performed from six months or one year post-transplant through five years post-transplant. For tests performed outside the scope of the payer's policy, and for tests performed where the payer has not adopted a coverage policy, we pursue reimbursement on a case-by-case basis. If a reimbursement claim is denied, we generally pursue the appeals process for the particular payer.\nSince our inception, we have generated significant net losses. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $173.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a net loss of $13.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized net income of $0.8 million and for the year ended 2013, we incurred a net loss of $3.5 million.\nRecent Developments\nAllenex Tender Offer\nOn December 16, 2015, we entered into Conditional Share Purchase Agreements, or Purchase Agreements, to acquire, subject to certain conditions, approximately 78% of the outstanding shares of Allenex AB, or Allenex, from\nits three principal shareholders in exchange for a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. On February 8, 2016, the parties entered into amendments to such Purchase Agreements to adjust the shares of our common stock issuable per share of Allenex, and change the timing of distribution of cash consideration. On March 7, 2016, we launched a tender offer, or the Offer, through the issuance of an Offer Document to acquire the remaining 22% of the shares of Allenex. Additionally, if in the Offer we acquire more than 90%, but less than 100%, of the shares of Allenex, which is necessary to initiate compulsory acquisition proceedings under Swedish laws, we intend to purchase the remaining shares in Allenex for cash, pursuant to such compulsory acquisition proceedings.\nOur tender offer to the shareholders of Allenex permits such shareholders to elect either an all cash payment or a mix of cash consideration and shares of our common stock. Under the all cash alternative, the shareholders of Allenex may exchange their shares of Allenex for approximately $0.30 per share. Under the mixed consideration alternative, the shareholders of Allenex may exchange their shares of Allenex for a combination of (i) $0.20 per share and (ii) 0.01458 shares of our common stock per share. We anticipate completing the tender offer in April 2016. If we acquire all Allenex shares, the total purchase price for Allenex will be approximately $35.0 million, payable in a combination of cash and equity. If the Allenex minority shareholders accept the all cash alternative, together with the cash component payable to the three principal shareholders, we will distribute approximately $27.0 million in cash, excluding financial advisory, legal and accounting fees (which must be paid whether or not the acquisition is completed). If the Allenex minority shareholders elect to receive both shares and a cash payment, we will distribute approximately $24.6 million in cash, excluding financial advisory, legal and accounting fees (which must be paid whether or not the acquisition is completed).\nAllenex is a transplant diagnostics company based in Stockholm, Sweden that develops, manufactures, markets and sells products that help match donor organs with potential recipients prior to transplantation. The acquisition of Allenex will create an international transplantation diagnostics company with product offerings along the pre- and post-transplant continuum. The Olerup SSP line, which addresses Human Leukocyte Antigen, or HLA, testing, and AlloMap are foundational diagnostics which are well recognized by the transplant community. The combined company will have a presence and direct distribution channels in the US and Europe.\nThe acquisition will require us to refinance or amend our existing $16.0 million debt loan with our existing lender. To fund a portion of the proposed acquisition and to refinance our existing loan, on December 15, 2015, we entered into a commitment letter and fee letter, or Commitment Letter, with Oberland Capital SA Davos LLC, collectively with its affiliates and assignees, Oberland Capital, which Commitment Letter was also amended and restated on February 8, 2016. The Commitment Letter sets forth the binding commitment, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth therein, by Oberland Capital to provide a short-term bridge loan of $18.0 million, to be borrowed in connection with the closing of the acquisition. The bridge loan will mature on the date that is six months from the closing date of the bridge loan. Approximately $16.0 million of the proceeds from the bridge loan will be used to repay our outstanding loan agreement with East West Bank. Fees incurred with Oberland Capital and third parties in connection with the bridge loan are estimated to be approximately $1.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively. The loan will be secured by substantially all of our assets. The loan will bear interest at the rate of 20% per annum, and prepayments of the loan will be subject to a prepayment premium of 5% for prepayments during the first month after the closing date for the loan, decreasing by 1% each month thereafter. The loan agreement for the bridge loan will contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, financial covenants and events of default.\nEven with the Oberland Capital bridge loan, the acquisition will consume a significant portion of our current cash and cash equivalents. We will require additional financing to fund our working capital and, within six months following entry into the bridge loan, to refinance the Oberland Capital bridge loan. We are pursuing financing opportunities in both the private and public debt and equity markets through sales of equity or debt securities. On August 10, 2015, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to which we are allowed to sell equity and debt securities. We cannot initiate sales under the Form S-3 until mid-2016.\nAbsent additional funding and assuming completion of the acquisition and entry into the bridge loan, we will exhaust our cash and cash equivalents in July 2016 unless we substantially reduce costs and operations, including research and development and other operating costs. Such costs reductions would significantly impair our ability to operate our business effectively, and raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFinancial Overview\nTesting Revenue\nOur testing revenue is derived from AlloMap tests which represented 99%, 95% and 98% of our total revenue in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our testing revenue depends on a number of factors, including (i) the number of tests performed; (ii) establishment of coverage policies by third-party insurers and government payers; (iii) our ability to collect from payers with whom we do not have positive coverage determination, which often requires that we pursue a case-by-case appeals process; (iv) our ability to recognize revenues on tests billed prior to the establishment of reimbursement policies, contracts or payment histories; (v) our ability to expand into markets outside of the United States; and (vi) how quickly we can successfully commercialize new product offerings.\nWe currently market AlloMap to healthcare providers through our direct sales force that targets transplant centers and their physicians, coordinators and nurse practitioners. The healthcare providers that order the tests and on whose behalf we provide our testing services are generally not responsible for the payment of these services. As of December 31, 2015, the list price of AlloMap was $3,600 per test. However, amounts actually received by us vary from payer to payer based on each payer's internal coverage practices and policies. We generally bill third-party payers upon delivery of an AlloMap score report to the ordering physician. As such, we take the assignment of benefits and the risk of collection from the third-party payer and individual patients.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the number of tests for which results were delivered and billed, but for which the associated revenue had not been recognized because our revenue recognition criteria were not met, and taking into account claim status and possibility of collection, was approximately 4,023 and 3,500, respectively. We cannot provide any assurance as to when, if ever, or to what extent any of these amounts will be collected.\nAlloSure, our development-stage transplant surveillance solution which applies proprietary next generation sequencing to detect and quantitate genetic differences between dd-cfDNA in the blood stream emanating from the donor heart and dd-cfDNA emanating from the transplant recipient, has not yet been commercialized and we do not yet receive any testing revenue from these tests.\nCollaboration and License Revenue\nRevenue from our collaboration and license agreements was not more than 5% of total revenue for each period presented. Collaboration and license agreements may include non-refundable upfront payments, partial or complete reimbursement of research and development costs, contingent payments based on the occurrence of specified events under the agreements, license fees and royalties on sales of products or product candidates if they are successfully commercialized. Note 8 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes descriptions of these agreements. Our performance obligations under the collaboration and license agreements may include the transfer of intellectual property rights in the form of licenses, obligations to provide research and development services and obligations to participate on certain development committees with the collaboration partners. We make judgments that affect the periods over which we recognize revenue. We periodically review our estimated periods of performance based on the progress under each arrangement and account for the impact of any change in estimated periods of performance on a prospective basis.\nCost of Testing\nCost of testing reflects the aggregate costs incurred in delivering our AlloMap test results to clinicians. The components of our cost of testing are materials and service costs, direct labor costs, including stock-based compensation, equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with testing samples, shipping, logistics and specimen processing charges to collect and transport samples and allocated overhead including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities and royalties. Costs associated with performing tests (except\nroyalties) are recorded as the test is processed regardless of whether and when revenue is recognized with respect to that test. Royalties incurred for licensed technology, calculated as a percentage of test revenues, are recorded as license fees in cost of testing at the time the test revenues are recognized.\nRoyalties included in cost of testing are associated with a license from Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., or Roche. In February 2014, we received a demand for arbitration from Roche regarding our claim that the royalty rate being assessed under the Roche license should be reduced. In September 2014, we entered into a settlement and mutual release agreement with Roche whereby (i) for the period beginning July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2014, we agreed to pay the amount of $2.8 million in settlement of past royalties due; (ii) for the period beginning July 1, 2014 through September 30, 2014, we agreed to pay royalties based on the same combination services percentage used to determine the past royalties due; (iii) for the period beginning October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2017, we agreed to a downward adjustment of the combination services percentage used to determine the portion of the AlloMap service that is royalty bearing under the terms of the license; (iv) we agreed to report and pay quarterly royalties within 45 days of the end of each calendar quarter; (v) Roche agreed that, subject to our timely payment of all applicable royalties through such date, no further royalties will be payable by us for periods after September 30, 2017; and (vi) mutual releases by us and Roche of all claims under the license agreement through the settlement date, and (vii) Roche agreed to dismiss the arbitration claims. For all time periods, the contractual royalty rate in the license agreement was or will be applied to the applicable combination services percentage to determine the royalties' payable for the AlloMap service\nWe expect cost of testing to increase, in absolute dollars, as the number of tests we perform increases. However, due to the fixed nature of expenses associated with direct labor, equipment and infrastructure, we expect the cost per test will decrease over time as volume increases.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses represent costs incurred to develop new surveillance solutions such as AlloSure, as well as continued efforts related to our AlloMap test. These expenses include payroll and related expenses, consulting expenses, laboratory supplies, and certain allocated expenses as well as amounts incurred under certain collaborative agreements. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We record accruals for estimated study costs comprised of work performed by contract research organizations under contract terms. We expect our research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we invest in research and discovery work to validate the clinical utility of AlloSure, develop new surveillance solutions and clinical outcomes studies for AlloMap.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses represent costs incurred to sell, promote and increase awareness of our AlloMap test to both clinicians and payers, including education of patients, clinicians and payers. Sales and marketing expenses include payroll and related expenses, educational and promotional expenses, and infrastructure expenses, including allocated facility and overhead costs. Compensation related to sales and marketing includes annual salaries and eligibility for quarterly or semi-annual commissions or bonuses based on the achievement of predetermined sales goals or other management objectives.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include costs for our executive, finance, accounting and human resources functions. Costs consist primarily of payroll and related expenses, professional service fees related to billing and collection, accounting, legal and other contract and administrative services and related infrastructure expenses, including allocated facility and overhead costs. We expect to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and The NASDAQ Global Market, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services. We also expect our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars related to anticipated testing volume and collections growth. Upon completion of our proposed acquisition of Allenex, we also expect our general and administrative expenses will increase as we operate as a global public company.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net is associated with borrowings under our loan agreements.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\nIn 2013 and 2014, Other (expense) income, net is primarily associated with the remeasurement of the estimated fair value of warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock and changes in the estimated fair value of a derivative associated with our subordinated convertible debt in 2014. Convertible preferred stock warrants and the subordinated convertible debt were converted to common stock warrants and common stock, respectively, upon the closing of our initial public offering on July 22, 2014.\nIn 2015, other (expense) income, net is primarily state franchise taxes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Items subject to estimates based on judgments include, but are not limited to: revenue recognition, the valuation of warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock, the determination of the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets, the determination of the accruals for clinical studies, the determination of estimated refunds to be requested from third-party payers, any impairment of long-lived assets and legal contingencies. Actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could affect the results of operations in future periods.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of these accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nTesting Revenue\nWe recognize revenues for tests delivered when the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, which may include a contract or a coverage policy; (ii) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.\nThe first criterion is satisfied when a third-party payer makes a coverage decision or enters into a contractual arrangement with us for the test. The second criterion is satisfied when we perform the test and deliver the test result to the ordering physician. The third criterion is satisfied if the third-party payer's coverage decision or reimbursement contract specifies a price for the test. The fourth criterion is satisfied based on management's judgments regarding the collectability of the fees charged under the arrangement.\nSuch judgments include review of past payment history. AlloMap testing may be considered investigational by some payers and not covered under their reimbursement policies. Others may cover the test, but not pay a set or determinable amount. As a result, in the absence of a reimbursement agreement or sufficient payment history, collectability cannot reasonably be assured so revenue is not recognized at the time the test is delivered.\nIf all criteria set forth above are met, revenue is recognized when the test results are delivered. When the first, third or fourth criteria are not met but third-party payers make a payment to us for tests performed, we recognize revenue on a cash basis in the period in which the payment is received.\nRevenue is recognized on an accrual basis, net of adjustments for differences between amounts billed and the estimated receipts from payers. The amount we expect to collect may be lower than the agreed upon amount due to several factors, such as the amount of patient co-payments, the existence of secondary payers and claim denials. Estimated receipts are based upon historical payment practices of payers. Differences between estimated and actual cash receipts are recorded as an adjustment to revenue, which have been immaterial to date.\nFor tests performed where an agreed upon reimbursement rate and a predictable history of collection exists, such as in the case of Medicare, we recognize revenue upon delivery of a score report to the ordering physician based on the established billing rate less contractual and other adjustments to arrive at the amount that we expect to collect. We determine the amount we expect to collect based on a per payer, per contract or agreement basis, after analyzing historical payment trends. The expected amount is typically lower than the agreed upon reimbursement amount due to several factors, such as the amount of patient co-payments and claim denials. In all other situations, where we do not have sufficient history of collection and are unable to determine a predictable pattern of payment, we recognize revenue upon the receipt of cash. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, approximately 68%, 64% and 64%, respectively, of our testing revenue was recognized on the accrual basis.\nOccasionally, we may receive requests from third-party payers for refunds for previously paid-for tests. We maintain a liability for actual overpayments and estimated future refund claims based on historical experience. Accruals for overpayments and refunds are recorded as a reduction of revenue. The approximate number of delivered AlloMap tests and AlloMap tests for which we recognized revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies discussed above, were as follows:\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AlloMap tests delivered\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AlloMap tests for which revenue was recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AlloMap tests for which revenue was recognized,\ndelivered prior to the period presented\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe did not recognize revenue for the remaining tests because either there was no contract, no coverage policy in place, insufficient payment history or we had not received payment for those tests from a payer. We will continue to make requests for payment from payers and patients and/or appeal payment decisions made by third-party payers. As a result, we may receive payment for a portion of these tests. However, a portion of our requests for payments could be denied or only partially satisfied. If third-party payers agree to pay us for these tests in the future, we will recognize revenue for such tests in the period in which our revenue recognition criteria are met. This will continue to affect the comparability of our revenues from period to period. We regularly review to determine if payers meet our revenue recognition criteria and account for the impact of any change on a prospective basis.\nThe process for determining the appropriate amount expected to be collected involves judgment, and considers such factors as, historical payment trends, current economic conditions and regulatory changes. The ultimate amounts of collections could be different from the amounts we estimate.\nCollaboration and License Revenue\nRevenue from our collaboration and license agreements was not more than 5% of total revenue for each period presented. Collaboration and license agreements may include non-refundable upfront payments, partial or complete reimbursement of research and development costs, contingent payments based on the occurrence of specified events under the agreements, license fees and royalties on sales of products or product candidates if they are successfully commercialized.\nWe recognize collaboration and license revenue based upon the relative-selling-price method which is used to allocate arrangement consideration to all of the units of accounting in an arrangement. We evaluate our collaboration and license agreements to identify the deliverables, determine if the deliverables have stand-alone value, to identify the units of accounting and to allocate arrangement consideration to each unit of accounting based on relative best estimate selling price.\nBusiness Combinations\nIn accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, we determine and allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the business combination date, including identifiable intangible assets which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. We base the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination on independent valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management's best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use.\nWe allocate any excess purchase price over the estimated fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, royalty rates, cash flows, discount rates, estimated useful lives and probabilities surrounding the achievement of contingent milestones, could result in different purchase price allocations and amortization expense in current and future periods.\nIn those circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement that meets the definition of a liability under ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments we expect to make as of the acquisition date. We remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value as a component of operating expenses.\nTransaction costs associated with acquisitions are expensed as incurred in general and administrative expenses. Results of operations and cash flows of acquired companies are included in our operating results from the date of acquisition.\nPurchased Intangible Assets\nAcquired intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are related to purchased in-process research and development, or IPR&D, projects and are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. We do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets would be deemed finite-lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives at that point in time.\nWe test IPR&D for impairment on an annual basis and in between annual tests if we become aware of any events or changes that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair values of the assets are below their carrying amounts. The IPR&D annual impairment test is performed as of December 1 of each year. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, then there is no impairment. Impairment losses on indefinite-lived intangible assets are recognized based solely on a comparison of the fair value of the asset to its carrying value, without consideration of any recoverability test. We have not identified any such impairment losses to date.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We then compare the carrying amounts of the assets with the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset over the asset's fair value determined using discounted estimates of future cash flows. We have not identified any such impairment losses to date.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of\nthese assets may not be recoverable. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of December 1 of each year.\nWe first conduct an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then conduct a two-step test for impairment of goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and no further analysis is required. If the carrying values of the reporting unit exceed its fair value, then the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference would be recorded.\nWarrants\nIn 2015, we issued warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in connection with a debt financing. We account for these warrants as equity based on the estimated fair value on the issuance date. The fair value of the outstanding warrants is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Black-Scholes valuation model requires inputs such as the expected term of the warrants, expected volatility and risk-free interest rate. Certain of these inputs are subjective and require significant analysis and judgment to develop. For the estimate of the expected term, we use the full remaining contractual term of the warrant.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation cost for only those shares underlying stock options that we expect to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. We estimate the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes valuation model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the option's expected term and stock price volatility. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nThe Number of AlloMap Tests We Receive and Report\nThe growth of our business is tied to the number of AlloMap tests we receive and report. Historically, less than 2% of tests received are not reported due to improper sampling or damage in transit or other causes. We incur costs of collecting and shipping all samples and a portion of the costs where we cannot ultimately issue a score report. As a result, the number of samples received largely directly correlates to the number of score reports.\nHow We Recognize Revenue\nMedicare and certain other payers with agreed upon reimbursement rates and a predictable history of collections allows us to recognize the related revenue on an accrual basis. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, 32%, 36% and 36%, respectively, of our revenue was recognized when cash was received. Until we achieve our revenue recognition criteria for a larger number of payers, we will continue to recognize a large portion of our revenue when cash is received. Because we often need to appeal prior to being paid for certain tests, it can take over a year for a test to result in revenue being recorded, and for a portion of our tests, we may never realize revenue.\nAdditionally, as we commercialize new products, we will need to achieve our revenue recognition criteria for each payer for each new product prior to being able to recognize the related revenue on an accrual basis. Because the timing and amount of cash payments received from payers is difficult to predict, we expect our revenue may fluctuate significantly in any given quarter. In addition, even if we begin to accrue larger amounts of revenue related\nto AlloMap, when we introduce new products, we do not expect we will be able to recognize revenue from new products on an accrual basis for some period of time.\nContinued Adoption of and Reimbursement for AlloMap\nOur reimbursement rate has steadily increased over time since the launch of AlloMap, as payers adopt coverage policies and fewer payers consider AlloMap as experimental and investigational. The rate at which our tests are covered and reimbursed has and is expected to continue to vary by payer. As of December 31, 2015, we had been reimbursed for approximately 79% of AlloMap results delivered in the twelve months ended June 30, 2015. Reimbursement performance is reviewed using a lagging metric of six months as any period less than this is considered not to be reflective of future performance, as the reimbursement process can take six months or more to complete depending on the payer. Revenue growth depends on our ability to achieve broader reimbursement from third party payers, to expand the number of tests per patient and the base of ordering physicians.\nDevelopment of Additional Products\nWe rely on sales of AlloMap to generate the majority of our revenue. Our product development pipeline includes other surveillance solutions for organ transplant recipients to help clinicians make personalized treatment decisions throughout a transplant patient's lifetime. Accordingly, we expect to invest in research and development in order to develop additional products. Our success in developing or acquiring new products will be important in our efforts to grow our business by expanding the potential market for our products and diversifying our sources of revenue.\nTiming of Research and Development Expenses\nOur spending on experiments may vary substantially from quarter to quarter. We also spend to secure clinical samples that can be used in discovery, product development, clinical validation, utility and outcome studies. The timing of these research and development activities is difficult to predict. If a substantial number of clinical samples are acquired in a given quarter or if a high-cost experiment is conducted in one quarter versus the next, the timing of these expenses can affect our financial results. We conduct clinical studies to validate our new products as well as on-going clinical and outcome studies to further the published evidence to support our commercialized AlloMap test. Spending on research and development for both experiments and clinical studies may vary significantly by quarter.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\n(In thousands except for AlloMap results)\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AlloMap results delivered\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Testing revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration and license revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,201\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of testing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in estimated fair value of contingent\nconsideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (126\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,239\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Loss) income from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,932\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,182\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,587\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,116\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (expense) income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (188\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (335\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,707\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (719\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,988\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,500\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13,707\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14,488\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTesting Revenue\nAlloMap test results delivered increased by approximately 1,100 or 9% in 2015 compared to 2014. Testing revenue increased by $2.0 million or 8% in 2015 compared to 2014 due to increased test volume of approximately $1.5 million, of which Medicare accounted for $0.7 million of the increase, and due to an increased number of payers for whom we recognize revenue on an accrual basis of approximately $0.8 million, partially offset by lower cash collections of approximately $0.4 million from payers from which we recognize revenue on a cash basis. Pricing remained stable in 2015.\nCollaboration and License Revenue\nCollaboration and license revenue decreased by approximately $1.2 million, or 82% in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the termination of our Collaboration and License Agreement with Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings in September 2014.\nCost of Testing\nCost of testing increased by approximately $1.7 million, or 20% in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher headcount related expenses of $0.7 million, laboratory material costs of $0.5 million to support testing volume growth, and higher royalties paid to Roche of $0.4 million.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses increased $5.5 million or 143% in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher headcount related expenses of $2.2 million and increased expenditure of $1.9 million to support the launch of dd-cfDNA clinical trials. In addition, there was an increase in depreciation and facilities-related expenses of $0.9 million due to the expansion of our lab space and consulting of $0.2 million.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses increased by approximately $1.9 million, or 29% in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase primarily reflects higher headcount related expenses of $0.9 million, recruiting and consulting expenses of $0.4 million, higher travel and conference expenses of $0.4 million as we ramped up our commercialization efforts, and an additional $0.2 million incurred in marketing programs such as physician forums, speaker programs and advertising.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased approximately $3.8 million, or 45% in 2015 compared to 2014 due to a $1.6 million increase in headcount related expenses driven primarily by the hiring of accounting personnel to operate and comply with the regulations for a publicly traded company and the in-sourcing of our billing and collections function, transaction related fees and expenses of $1.3 million associated with the acquisition of Allenex, and an increase in professional fees of $0.8 million primarily associated with the filing of a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which allow us to sell equity and debt securities commencing in mid-2016.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\nThe consideration for our business combination with ImmuMetrix, Inc. includes a future payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a specified milestone. We recorded a contingent consideration liability at its fair value in September 2014, at the acquisition date. We revalue our contingent consideration obligation each reporting period. The change in the fair value of our contingent consideration is approximately $1.1 million in 2015 as compared to 2014, and is recognized as a component of operating expense within our statements of operations.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net decreased by $0.5 million, or 25% in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower interest rates on the new term loan, the conversion of the $5.0 million Illumina subordinated convertible note into common stock in connection with our IPO and the pay-off of our previous term loan with higher interest rates in January 2015.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\nOther expense, net was $0.2 million in 2015 compared to $0.1 million in other income, net in 2014. Other expense, net for 2015 primarily consisted of state franchise taxes. Other income, net of $0.1 million in 2014 was primarily related to the remeasurement of the convertible preferred stock warrants and the derivative associated with the Illumina subordinated convertible note.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIn conjunction with the acquisition of ImmuMetrix, a tax benefit of $1.5 million was recognized in 2014. This benefit resulted from the expectation that amortization of the in-process technology acquired, when completed and placed in service, is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes, as the transaction was structured as a tax-free reorganization. Accordingly, a deferred tax liability was recorded at the acquisition date for the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of the acquired in-process technology. While the in-process technology is considered an indefinite lived intangible asset, this asset is expected to be amortized or impaired prior to the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards available to us.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\n(In thousands except for AlloMap results)\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AlloMap results delivered\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Testing revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration and license revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of testing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (537\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in estimated fair value of contingent\nconsideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,239\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,239\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (857\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,116\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,149\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (536\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (719\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,542\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,542\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTesting Revenue\nAlloMap test results delivered increased by approximately 1,800 or 18% in 2014 compared to 2013. Testing revenue increased by $4.2 million or 19% in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to increased test volume and secondarily to an increased number of payers for whom we recognize revenue on an accrual basis of approximately $2.6 million, of which Medicare accounted for $1.3 million of the increase, and additional cash collections of approximately $1.6 million from payers from which we recognize revenue on a cash basis.\nCollaboration and License Revenue\nCollaboration and license revenue increased by approximately $1.0 million, or 244% in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to our recognition of the termination fee of $0.5 million paid to us in connection with the termination of our Collaboration and License Agreement with Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, and amortization of the remaining deferred revenue balance under that agreement of $0.6 million.\nCost of Testing\nCost of testing decreased by approximately $0.5 million, or 6% in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to our royalty settlement with Roche, which resulted in a one-time reduction to royalty expense in 2014 of approximately $0.5 million.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses increased $0.7 million or 21% in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to increased expenditure of $0.3 million in the area of dd-cfDNA technology, an increase in headcount related expenses of $0.2 million, and increased expenditures of $0.2 million for AlloMap activities.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses increased by approximately $0.6 million, or 10% in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase primarily reflects increased salaries of $0.3 million, and increased travel and conference expenses of $0.3 million as we increased our commercialization efforts.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased approximately $3.6 million, or 75% in 2014 compared to 2013 due to increased employee costs of $1.1 million driven by additional hiring in preparation for our IPO, increased tax, audit and professional fees of $0.8 million as a result of our acquisition of ImmuMetrix and increased compliance costs of being a public company, $0.4 million of increased consulting fees, increased legal costs of $0.8 million largely as a result of our acquisition of ImmuMetrix and arbitration with Roche, $0.3 million associated with recruiting expenses of key employees and $0.2 million in general expenses. We anticipate our general and administrative expenses will increase as we operate as a public company.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net was flat from 2013 to 2014. There was an increase of $0.4 million associated with the $5.0 million Illumina subordinated convertible note issued in April 2014 with an interest rate of 8% which converted to common stock upon our IPO in July 2014, which was offset by a one-time reduction in interest expense of approximately $0.1 million due to the Roche settlement and a $0.3 million decrease in interest under our debt obligations due to principal payments.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income, net was $0.1 million in 2014 compared to $0.5 million in other expense, net in 2013. Other income, net for 2014 was primarily due to the remeasurement of the derivative associated with the Illumina subordinated convertible note. The subordinated convertible note was converted to common stock in July 2014 in connection with our IPO. Other expense, net for 2013 was primarily due to the remeasurement of the estimated fair value of the warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock. The warrants to purchase our convertible preferred stock were converted to warrants to purchase common stock in July 2014 in connection with our IPO and were reclassified to additional paid-in-capital on the IPO date at which point we ceased to record any further related periodic fair value adjustments.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIn conjunction with the acquisition of ImmuMetrix, a tax benefit of $1.5 million was recognized in 2014. This benefit resulted from the expectation that amortization of the in-process technology acquired, when completed and placed in service, is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes, as the transaction was structured as a tax-free reorganization. Accordingly, a deferred tax liability was recorded at the acquisition date for the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of the acquired in-process technology. While the in-process technology is considered an indefinite lived intangible asset, this asset is expected to be amortized or impaired prior to the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards available to us.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, substantially all of our operations have been financed through the issuance of our convertible preferred stock, the issuance of common stock in our July 2014 initial public offering, the incurrence of debt, and cash received from AlloMap testing revenues. Through December 31, 2015, we have received net proceeds of approximately $174 million from AlloMap testing revenues, $151 million from the issuances of preferred stock, including preferred stock issued on conversion of promissory notes, $35.5 million from our IPO, and $35.3 million in net proceeds from debt issuances, including $5.0 million from a subordinated convertible note. As of December, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $29.9 million and $15.8 million of debt outstanding under our debt and capital lease obligations, net of debt discount and issuance costs. We currently anticipate that our cash and cash\nequivalents, projected cash receipts from AlloMap sales to customers and existing term loan from a financial institution will not be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months.\nOn December 16, 2015, we entered into Purchase Agreements to acquire, subject to certain conditions, approximately 78% of the outstanding shares of Allenex from its three principal shareholders in exchange for a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. If we acquire all Allenex shares, the total purchase price for Allenex will be approximately $35.0 million, payable in a combination of cash and equity. If the Allenex minority shareholders accept the all cash alternative, together with the cash component payable to the three principal shareholders, we will distribute approximately $27.0 million in cash, excluding financial advisory, legal and accounting fees (which must be paid whether or not the acquisition is completed). If the Allenex minority shareholders elect to receive both shares and a cash payment, we will distribute approximately $24.6 million in cash, excluding financial advisory, legal and accounting fees (which must be paid whether or not the acquisition is completed). Additionally, if in the tender offer we acquire more than 90%, but less than 100%, of the shares of Allenex, we intend to initiate compulsory acquisition proceedings under Swedish laws and to purchase the remaining shares in Allenex for cash. The actual price per share purchased pursuant to such compulsory acquisition proceedings will be determined by an arbitrational tribunal. As a result of the compulsory acquisition proceedings under Swedish law, we may ultimately have to pay, in the aggregate, a higher price per share in order to purchase the remaining Allenex shares, further depleting our cash reserves. Refer to Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition-Overview-Recent Developments-Allenex Tender Offer\u201d included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nThe acquisition will require us to refinance or amend our existing $16.0 million debt loan with our existing lender, and we also expect to incur costs as we integrate Allenex's business and operations with ours. To fund a portion of the proposed acquisition and to refinance our existing loan, on December 15, 2015, we entered into a commitment letter and fee letter, or Commitment Letter, with Oberland Capital SA Davos LLC, collectively with its affiliates and assignees, Oberland Capital, for a six-month bridge loan of $18.0 million, to be borrowed in connection with the closing of the acquisition. Fees incurred with Oberland Capital and third parties in connection with the bridge loan are estimated to be approximately $1.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively. The loan will be secured by substantially all of our assets. The loan will bear interest at the rate of 20% per annum, and prepayments of the loan will be subject to a prepayment premium of 5% for prepayments during the first month after the closing date for the loan, decreasing by 1% each month thereafter. The loan agreement for the bridge loan will contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, financial covenants and events of default.\nEven with the Oberland Capital bridge loan, the acquisition will consume a significant portion of our current cash and cash equivalents. We will require additional financing to fund our working capital and, within six months following entry into the bridge loan, to refinance the Oberland Capital bridge loan. We are pursuing financing opportunities in both the private and public debt and equity markets through sales of equity or debt securities. On August 10, 2015, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to which we are allowed to sell equity and debt securities. We cannot initiate sales under the Form S-3 until mid-2016.\nAbsent additional funding and assuming completion of the acquisition and entry into the bridge loan, we will exhaust our cash and cash equivalents in July 2016 unless we substantially reduce costs and operations, including research and development and other operating costs. As a result of our obligations and lack of current available financial resources, there is uncertainty regarding our ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate our business effectively, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to raise outside capital in the near term, we will be required to significantly reduce or cease operations.\nIf we do not perform our obligation to complete the acquisition, we may be subject to fines and penalties under Swedish law, in addition to stockholder claims. Nasdaq Stockholm Takeover Rules authorize the institution to impose a special fine ranging between SEK 50,000 (approximately $6,000) and SEK 100 million (approximately $12.0 million). If we fail to perform our obligation to close the acquisition, we may also be subject to stockholder claims for damages under the purchase agreements and under the Swedish Takeover Rules. Such penalties, fines and contract damages claims may also trigger a default under our current loan agreement, and could have other unforeseen consequences that could negatively affect our business and the price of our common stock.\nWe cannot be certain that any of our development of new transplant surveillance solutions such as AlloSure will be successful or that we will be able to raise sufficient additional funds to see these programs through to a successful result. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risk and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9,752\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,350\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (546\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,199\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,333\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (98\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (58\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (6,543\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (702\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by or used in operating activities consists of net income or loss, adjusted for certain non-cash items in the statements of operations and changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $9.8 million.

These net noncash expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $1.3 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $0.8 million, and $0.2 million for the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with new debt, and a loss on extinguishment from previous debt. These non-cash expenses were partially offset by a non-cash revaluation gain of $0.1 million on a contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of ImmuMetrix, Inc. in June 2014. This revaluation gain was driven by a decrease in our stock price.\nIn addition to net non-cash expenses, our net operating assets decreased which generated $1.8 million in operating cash flow. The decrease in net operating assets was primarily driven by a decrease in accounts receivable of $0.3 million, increases in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities of $1.7 million as we strengthened our cash management processes, an increase in accrued payroll liabilities of $0.7 million as a result of accrued employee bonuses, partially offset by increases in inventory, prepaid expenses and other assets of $0.9 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $3.4 million. The net income of $0.8 million reflects a non-cash income tax benefit of $1.5 million related to our acquisition of ImmuMetrix, the recognition of $0.7 million in collaboration revenue primarily from the termination of the LabCorp agreement, a $1.5 million decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration related to the ImmuMetrix acquisition and an embedded derivative as a result of mark-to-market adjustments, partially offset by an increase in debt discount accretion and other non-cash interest expense of $0.8 million, depreciation and amortization of $0.5 million and stock-based compensation expense of $0.5 million, and an increase in net operating assets of $2.3 million. The increase in net operating assets primarily comprised of a decrease in accrued royalties of $2.6 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $0.4 million and an increase in inventory of $0.2 million as a result of an increase in our testing revenue, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $0.3 million primarily due to our purchase of a directors and officers insurance policy when we became a public company in July 2014, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $0.5 million and an increase in accrued and other liabilities of $0.4 million as our expenditures increased in line with the growth of our core business, and an increase in payroll-related liabilities of $0.3 million due to an increase in headcount. The decrease in accrued royalties was the result of a $2.8 million payment of past due royalties to Roche in September 2014 upon settlement of our dispute with Roche (for more information, see Note 7 of our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report).\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $0.5 million and reflected (i) a net loss of $3.5 million, (ii) net non-cash items of $1.6 million, consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization of $0.7 million, amortization of debt discount and non-cash interest expense of $0.6 million and revaluation of warrants to estimated fair value of $0.5 million, and (iii) a net cash inflow from changes in balances of operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million. The significant items comprising the changes in balances of operating assets and liabilities were a higher balance of accrued royalties of $1.3 million and a higher deferred revenue balance of $1.1 million, partially offset by an increased accounts receivable balance of $1.3 million. The increased accounts receivable balance was due to increased volume of approximately $0.7 million, the change in our Medicare contractor effective October 2013, resulting in slower payments for Medicare tests of approximately $0.3 million, and more payers meeting our revenue recognition criteria of approximately $0.3 million. Our experience with Medicare contractor changes in the past has shown initially slower payments, which accelerate after the new contractor is in place for some period.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $1.2 million for purchases of property and equipment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $1.3 million consisting $0.6 million in cash used to purchase ImmuMetrix and $0.7 million in purchases of property and equipment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash used in investing activities was $0.1 million and consisted of purchases of property and equipment.\nWe expect capital expenditures to increase dramatically in 2016 and beyond due to the entry into the Commitment Letter with Oberland Capital, the acquisition of Allenex and becoming a global company. We also plan to continue to expand our research and discovery work to develop new transplant surveillance solutions.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $4.4 million consisted primarily of $15.6 million in net proceeds received from a new term loan in January 2015, and proceeds of $0.2 million from the issuance of common stock as part of our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options, partially offset by the payoff of a previous term loan and capital leases of $11.5 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $35.9 million was primarily from the receipt of $35.5 million in net proceeds from our July 2014 initial public offering, net of underwriters' discounts and issuance costs, and the receipt of $5.0 million in net proceeds from borrowing in connection with our April 2014 subordinated convertible note, partially offset by net payments of $4.5 million on our existing debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $0.1 million and primarily consisted of principal payments on capital lease obligations.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes certain contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015, and excludes the obligations related to our proposed acquisition of Allenex entry into the Oberland Capital bridge loan, and the acceleration of our current loan agreement with East West Bank due to entry into the new debt facility with Oberland Capital:\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 to 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 to 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2015, there was a material increase in our contractual obligations and commitments. On January 30, 2015, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement\u201d), which provides a secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $20.0 million. We borrowed the first and only advance of $16.0 million ( Draw A\u201d) on January 30, 2015. Draw A was used to pay-off our existing term debt of $11.3 million. Draw A bears interest at a daily floating rate equal to 2.00%, over the greater of (i) 3.25% or (ii) the prime rate published by the lender.\nThe maturity date of the loan is December 1, 2018. Principal pay-down of the loan begins on January 1, 2016 with the loan being payable in 36 equal monthly installments. The principal pay-down of the loan may be delayed to July 1, 2016 with the loan being payable in 30 equal monthly installments, if on December 31, 2015, we have achieved certain net product revenue milestones as described in the Loan Agreement. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the net product revenue milestones, which allowed us to pay only the interest incurred on a monthly basis until June 30, 2016 and begin the principal pay-down on July 1, 2016.\nOur cancelable operating lease obligations consist of the lease for our laboratory and office facility in Brisbane, California expiring in December 2020. Our capital lease obligations consist of equipment financing arrangements with vendors. The contractual obligations table above includes three new capital leases entered into in 2015.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nWe are an emerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018. Early adoption is permitted in 2017. The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect\nrecognized as of the date of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new revenue standard on our financial statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d). This ASU requires us to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the financial statements are issued, and if there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, the disclosure of such is required. We are required to make this evaluation for both annual and interim reporting periods, if applicable. We also are required to evaluate and disclose whether our plans alleviate that doubt. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted but we have not elected to early adopt this guidance.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03\u201d). This ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This guidance is applicable to us beginning January 1, 2016. However, early adoption of ASU 2015-03 is permitted and we adopted ASU 2015-03 as of January 1, 2015 using the retrospective method as required. Debt discount and issuance costs, current, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $155,000 and $170,000, respectively. Debt discount and issuance costs, non-current, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $149,000 and $177,000, respectively.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40) ( ASU 2015-05\u201d). This ASU provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. This ASU will be effective for reporting periods, including interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. An entity can elect to adopt the amendments either (1) prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date or (2) retrospectively. For prospective transition, the only disclosure requirements at transition are the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle, the transition method, and a qualitative description of the financial statement line items affected by the change. For retrospective transition, the disclosure requirements at transition include the requirements for prospective transition and quantitative information about the effects of the accounting change. We do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory ( ASU 2015-11\u201d). ASU 2015-11 simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory by replacing the lower of cost or market with a lower of cost and net realizable value test. The guidance applies only to inventories for which cost is determined by methods other than last-in first-out ( LIFO\u201d) and the retail inventory method ( RIM\u201d). Entities that use LIFO and RIM will continue to use existing impairment models. The guidance is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance must be applied prospectively after the date of adoption. We do not expect to early adopt this guidance and do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The guidance is effective for us beginning on January 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of any interim or annual reporting period. We do not expect to early adopt this guidance and do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which, for operating leases, requires the lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in its\nbalance sheet. The guidance also requires a lessee to recognize single lease costs, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term, on a generally straight-line basis. This guidance will be effective for the Company in fiscal year 2019 and must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition approach. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.", "summary": "This report discusses the financial condition and operations of a molecular diagnostics company, focusing on the AlloMap heart transplant molecular test as its first commercialized product.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the Section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A, and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nBusiness Overview\nWe are a molecular diagnostics company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of clinically differentiated, high-value diagnostic surveillance solutions for transplant patients. Our first commercialized testing solution, the AlloMap heart transplant molecular test, or AlloMap, is a gene expression test that helps clinicians monitor and identify heart transplant recipients with stable graft function who have a low probability of moderate/severe acute cellular rejection. Since 2008, we have sought to expand the adoption and utilization of our AlloMap solution through ongoing studies to substantiate the clinical utility and actionability of AlloMap, secure positive reimbursement decisions for AlloMap from large private and public payers, develop and enhance our relationships with key members of the transplant community, including opinion leaders at major transplant centers, and explore opportunities and technologies for the development of additional solutions for post-transplant surveillance. We believe the use of AlloMap, in conjunction with other clinical indicators, can help healthcare providers and their patients better manage long-term care following a heart transplant. In particular, we believe AlloMap can improve patient care by helping healthcare providers to avoid the use of unnecessary, invasive surveillance biopsies and to determine the appropriate dosage levels of immunosuppressants. We are also pursuing the development of additional products for transplant monitoring using a variety of technologies, including AlloSure, our next-generation sequencing-based test to detect donor-derived cell-free DNA, or dd-cfDNA after transplantation.\nSince the launch of AlloMap in January 2005 we have performed more than 81,000 commercial AlloMap tests, including 13,000 tests in 2015, in our Brisbane, California laboratory. In 2015, the test was used in 120 of the approximately 130 heart transplant management centers in the U.S. We believe that there is an opportunity for AlloMap outside of the U.S. and through recent partnerships we have expanded the AlloMap offering to Europe. We believe that we are not currently capacity constrained and that our current facility can support a substantial increase in AlloMap testing volume.\nReimbursement for AlloMap tests comes primarily from Medicare, private third party payers such as insurance companies and managed care organizations, hospitals and state Medicaid programs. Tests performed on patients covered by Medicare represented 36%, 37% and 39% of all AlloMap tests in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. A number of payers have adopted coverage policies approving AlloMap tests for reimbursement. Such policies often approve reimbursement for tests performed from six months or one year post-transplant through five years post-transplant. For tests performed outside the scope of the payer's policy, and for tests performed where the payer has not adopted a coverage policy, we pursue reimbursement on a case-by-case basis. If a reimbursement claim is denied, we generally pursue the appeals process for the particular payer.\nSince our inception, we have generated significant net losses. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $173.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a net loss of $13.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized net income of $0.8 million and for the year ended 2013, we incurred a net loss of $3.5 million.\nRecent Developments\nAllenex Tender Offer\nOn December 16, 2015, we entered into Conditional Share Purchase Agreements, or Purchase Agreements, to acquire, subject to certain conditions, approximately 78% of the outstanding shares of Allenex AB, or Allenex, from\nits three principal shareholders in exchange for a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. On February 8, 2016, the parties entered into amendments to such Purchase Agreements to adjust the shares of our common stock issuable per share of Allenex, and change the timing of distribution of cash consideration. On March 7, 2016, we launched a tender offer, or the Offer, through the issuance of an Offer Document to acquire the remaining 22% of the shares of Allenex. Additionally, if in the Offer we acquire more than 90%, but less than 100%, of the shares of Allenex, which is necessary to initiate compulsory acquisition proceedings under Swedish laws, we intend to purchase the remaining shares in Allenex for cash, pursuant to such compulsory acquisition proceedings.\nOur tender offer to the shareholders of Allenex permits such shareholders to elect either an all cash payment or a mix of cash consideration and shares of our common stock. Under the all cash alternative, the shareholders of Allenex may exchange their shares of Allenex for approximately $0.30 per share. Under the mixed consideration alternative, the shareholders of Allenex may exchange their shares of Allenex for a combination of (i) $0.20 per share and (ii) 0.01458 shares of our common stock per share. We anticipate completing the tender offer in April 2016. If we acquire all Allenex shares, the total purchase price for Allenex will be approximately $35.0 million, payable in a combination of cash and equity. If the Allenex minority shareholders accept the all cash alternative, together with the cash component payable to the three principal shareholders, we will distribute approximately $27.0 million in cash, excluding financial advisory, legal and accounting fees (which must be paid whether or not the acquisition is completed). If the Allenex minority shareholders elect to receive both shares and a cash payment, we will distribute approximately $24.6 million in cash, excluding financial advisory, legal and accounting fees (which must be paid whether or not the acquisition is completed).\nAllenex is a transplant diagnostics company based in Stockholm, Sweden that develops, manufactures, markets and sells products that help match donor organs with potential recipients prior to transplantation. The acquisition of Allenex will create an international transplantation diagnostics company with product offerings along the pre- and post-transplant continuum. The Olerup SSP line, which addresses Human Leukocyte Antigen, or HLA, testing, and AlloMap are foundational diagnostics which are well recognized by the transplant community. The combined company will have a presence and direct distribution channels in the US and Europe.\nThe acquisition will require us to refinance or amend our existing $16.0 million debt loan with our existing lender. To fund a portion of the proposed acquisition and to refinance our existing loan, on December 15, 2015, we entered into a commitment letter and fee letter, or Commitment Letter, with Oberland Capital SA Davos LLC, collectively with its affiliates and assignees, Oberland Capital, which Commitment Letter was also amended and restated on February 8, 2016. The Commitment Letter sets forth the binding commitment, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth therein, by Oberland Capital to provide a short-term bridge loan of $18.0 million, to be borrowed in connection with the closing of the acquisition. The bridge loan will mature on the date that is six months from the closing date of the bridge loan. Approximately $16.0 million of the proceeds from the bridge loan will be used to repay our outstanding loan agreement with East West Bank. Fees incurred with Oberland Capital and third parties in connection with the bridge loan are estimated to be approximately $1.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively. The loan will be secured by substantially all of our assets. The loan will bear interest at the rate of 20% per annum, and prepayments of the loan will be subject to a prepayment premium of 5% for prepayments during the first month after the closing date for the loan, decreasing by 1% each month thereafter. The loan agreement for the bridge loan will contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, financial covenants and events of default.\nEven with the Oberland Capital bridge loan, the acquisition will consume a significant portion of our current cash and cash equivalents. We will require additional financing to fund our working capital and, within six months following entry into the bridge loan, to refinance the Oberland Capital bridge loan. We are pursuing financing opportunities in both the private and public debt and equity markets through sales of equity or debt securities. On August 10, 2015, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to which we are allowed to sell equity and debt securities. We cannot initiate sales under the Form S-3 until mid-2016.\nAbsent additional funding and assuming completion of the acquisition and entry into the bridge loan, we will exhaust our cash and cash equivalents in July 2016 unless we substantially reduce costs and operations, including research and development and other operating costs. Such costs reductions would significantly impair our ability to operate our business effectively, and raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFinancial Overview\nTesting Revenue\nOur testing revenue is derived from AlloMap tests which represented 99%, 95% and 98% of our total revenue in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our testing revenue depends on a number of factors, including (i) the number of tests performed; (ii) establishment of coverage policies by third-party insurers and government payers; (iii) our ability to collect from payers with whom we do not have positive coverage determination, which often requires that we pursue a case-by-case appeals process; (iv) our ability to recognize revenues on tests billed prior to the establishment of reimbursement policies, contracts or payment histories; (v) our ability to expand into markets outside of the United States; and (vi) how quickly we can successfully commercialize new product offerings.\nWe currently market AlloMap to healthcare providers through our direct sales force that targets transplant centers and their physicians, coordinators and nurse practitioners. The healthcare providers that order the tests and on whose behalf we provide our testing services are generally not responsible for the payment of these services. As of December 31, 2015, the list price of AlloMap was $3,600 per test. However, amounts actually received by us vary from payer to payer based on each payer's internal coverage practices and policies. We generally bill third-party payers upon delivery of an AlloMap score report to the ordering physician. As such, we take the assignment of benefits and the risk of collection from the third-party payer and individual patients.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the number of tests for which results were delivered and billed, but for which the associated revenue had not been recognized because our revenue recognition criteria were not met, and taking into account claim status and possibility of collection, was approximately 4,023 and 3,500, respectively. We cannot provide any assurance as to when, if ever, or to what extent any of these amounts will be collected.\nAlloSure, our development-stage transplant surveillance solution which applies proprietary next generation sequencing to detect and quantitate genetic differences between dd-cfDNA in the blood stream emanating from the donor heart and dd-cfDNA emanating from the transplant recipient, has not yet been commercialized and we do not yet receive any testing revenue from these tests.\nCollaboration and License Revenue\nRevenue from our collaboration and license agreements was not more than 5% of total revenue for each period presented. Collaboration and license agreements may include non-refundable upfront payments, partial or complete reimbursement of research and development costs, contingent payments based on the occurrence of specified events under the agreements, license fees and royalties on sales of products or product candidates if they are successfully commercialized. Note 8 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes descriptions of these agreements. Our performance obligations under the collaboration and license agreements may include the transfer of intellectual property rights in the form of licenses, obligations to provide research and development services and obligations to participate on certain development committees with the collaboration partners. We make judgments that affect the periods over which we recognize revenue. We periodically review our estimated periods of performance based on the progress under each arrangement and account for the impact of any change in estimated periods of performance on a prospective basis.\nCost of Testing\nCost of testing reflects the aggregate costs incurred in delivering our AlloMap test results to clinicians. The components of our cost of testing are materials and service costs, direct labor costs, including stock-based compensation, equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with testing samples, shipping, logistics and specimen processing charges to collect and transport samples and allocated overhead including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities and royalties. Costs associated with performing tests (except\nroyalties) are recorded as the test is processed regardless of whether and when revenue is recognized with respect to that test. Royalties incurred for licensed technology, calculated as a percentage of test revenues, are recorded as license fees in cost of testing at the time the test revenues are recognized.\nRoyalties included in cost of testing are associated with a license from Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., or Roche. In February 2014, we received a demand for arbitration from Roche regarding our claim that the royalty rate being assessed under the Roche license should be reduced. In September 2014, we entered into a settlement and mutual release agreement with Roche whereby (i) for the period beginning July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2014, we agreed to pay the amount of $2.8 million in settlement of past royalties due; (ii) for the period beginning July 1, 2014 through September 30, 2014, we agreed to pay royalties based on the same combination services percentage used to determine the past royalties due; (iii) for the period beginning October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2017, we agreed to a downward adjustment of the combination services percentage used to determine the portion of the AlloMap service that is royalty bearing under the terms of the license; (iv) we agreed to report and pay quarterly royalties within 45 days of the end of each calendar quarter; (v) Roche agreed that, subject to our timely payment of all applicable royalties through such date, no further royalties will be payable by us for periods after September 30, 2017; and (vi) mutual releases by us and Roche of all claims under the license agreement through the settlement date, and (vii) Roche agreed to dismiss the arbitration claims. For all time periods, the contractual royalty rate in the license agreement was or will be applied to the applicable combination services percentage to determine the royalties' payable for the AlloMap service\nWe expect cost of testing to increase, in absolute dollars, as the number of tests we perform increases. However, due to the fixed nature of expenses associated with direct labor, equipment and infrastructure, we expect the cost per test will decrease over time as volume increases.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses represent costs incurred to develop new surveillance solutions such as AlloSure, as well as continued efforts related to our AlloMap test. These expenses include payroll and related expenses, consulting expenses, laboratory supplies, and certain allocated expenses as well as amounts incurred under certain collaborative agreements. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We record accruals for estimated study costs comprised of work performed by contract research organizations under contract terms. We expect our research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we invest in research and discovery work to validate the clinical utility of AlloSure, develop new surveillance solutions and clinical outcomes studies for AlloMap.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses represent costs incurred to sell, promote and increase awareness of our AlloMap test to both clinicians and payers, including education of patients, clinicians and payers. Sales and marketing expenses include payroll and related expenses, educational and promotional expenses, and infrastructure expenses, including allocated facility and overhead costs. Compensation related to sales and marketing includes annual salaries and eligibility for quarterly or semi-annual commissions or bonuses based on the achievement of predetermined sales goals or other management objectives.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include costs for our executive, finance, accounting and human resources functions. Costs consist primarily of payroll and related expenses, professional service fees related to billing and collection, accounting, legal and other contract and administrative services and related infrastructure expenses, including allocated facility and overhead costs. We expect to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and The NASDAQ Global Market, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services. We also expect our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars related to anticipated testing volume and collections growth. Upon completion of our proposed acquisition of Allenex, we also expect our general and administrative expenses will increase as we operate as a global public company.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net is associated with borrowings under our loan agreements.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\nIn 2013 and 2014, Other (expense) income, net is primarily associated with the remeasurement of the estimated fair value of warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock and changes in the estimated fair value of a derivative associated with our subordinated convertible debt in 2014. Convertible preferred stock warrants and the subordinated convertible debt were converted to common stock warrants and common stock, respectively, upon the closing of our initial public offering on July 22, 2014.\nIn 2015, other (expense) income, net is primarily state franchise taxes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Items subject to estimates based on judgments include, but are not limited to: revenue recognition, the valuation of warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock, the determination of the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets, the determination of the accruals for clinical studies, the determination of estimated refunds to be requested from third-party payers, any impairment of long-lived assets and legal contingencies. Actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could affect the results of operations in future periods.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of these accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nTesting Revenue\nWe recognize revenues for tests delivered when the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, which may include a contract or a coverage policy; (ii) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.\nThe first criterion is satisfied when a third-party payer makes a coverage decision or enters into a contractual arrangement with us for the test. The second criterion is satisfied when we perform the test and deliver the test result to the ordering physician. The third criterion is satisfied if the third-party payer's coverage decision or reimbursement contract specifies a price for the test. The fourth criterion is satisfied based on management's judgments regarding the collectability of the fees charged under the arrangement.\nSuch judgments include review of past payment history. AlloMap testing may be considered investigational by some payers and not covered under their reimbursement policies. Others may cover the test, but not pay a set or determinable amount. As a result, in the absence of a reimbursement agreement or sufficient payment history, collectability cannot reasonably be assured so revenue is not recognized at the time the test is delivered.\nIf all criteria set forth above are met, revenue is recognized when the test results are delivered. When the first, third or fourth criteria are not met but third-party payers make a payment to us for tests performed, we recognize revenue on a cash basis in the period in which the payment is received.\nRevenue is recognized on an accrual basis, net of adjustments for differences between amounts billed and the estimated receipts from payers. The amount we expect to collect may be lower than the agreed upon amount due to several factors, such as the amount of patient co-payments, the existence of secondary payers and claim denials. Estimated receipts are based upon historical payment practices of payers. Differences between estimated and actual cash receipts are recorded as an adjustment to revenue, which have been immaterial to date.\nFor tests performed where an agreed upon reimbursement rate and a predictable history of collection exists, such as in the case of Medicare, we recognize revenue upon delivery of a score report to the ordering physician based on the established billing rate less contractual and other adjustments to arrive at the amount that we expect to collect. We determine the amount we expect to collect based on a per payer, per contract or agreement basis, after analyzing historical payment trends. The expected amount is typically lower than the agreed upon reimbursement amount due to several factors, such as the amount of patient co-payments and claim denials. In all other situations, where we do not have sufficient history of collection and are unable to determine a predictable pattern of payment, we recognize revenue upon the receipt of cash. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, approximately 68%, 64% and 64%, respectively, of our testing revenue was recognized on the accrual basis.\nOccasionally, we may receive requests from third-party payers for refunds for previously paid-for tests. We maintain a liability for actual overpayments and estimated future refund claims based on historical experience. Accruals for overpayments and refunds are recorded as a reduction of revenue. The approximate number of delivered AlloMap tests and AlloMap tests for which we recognized revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies discussed above, were as follows:\n\nWe did not recognize revenue for the remaining tests because either there was no contract, no coverage policy in place, insufficient payment history or we had not received payment for those tests from a payer. We will continue to make requests for payment from payers and patients and/or appeal payment decisions made by third-party payers. As a result, we may receive payment for a portion of these tests. However, a portion of our requests for payments could be denied or only partially satisfied. If third-party payers agree to pay us for these tests in the future, we will recognize revenue for such tests in the period in which our revenue recognition criteria are met. This will continue to affect the comparability of our revenues from period to period. We regularly review to determine if payers meet our revenue recognition criteria and account for the impact of any change on a prospective basis.\nThe process for determining the appropriate amount expected to be collected involves judgment, and considers such factors as, historical payment trends, current economic conditions and regulatory changes. The ultimate amounts of collections could be different from the amounts we estimate.\nCollaboration and License Revenue\nRevenue from our collaboration and license agreements was not more than 5% of total revenue for each period presented. Collaboration and license agreements may include non-refundable upfront payments, partial or complete reimbursement of research and development costs, contingent payments based on the occurrence of specified events under the agreements, license fees and royalties on sales of products or product candidates if they are successfully commercialized.\nWe recognize collaboration and license revenue based upon the relative-selling-price method which is used to allocate arrangement consideration to all of the units of accounting in an arrangement. We evaluate our collaboration and license agreements to identify the deliverables, determine if the deliverables have stand-alone value, to identify the units of accounting and to allocate arrangement consideration to each unit of accounting based on relative best estimate selling price.\nBusiness Combinations\nIn accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, we determine and allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the business combination date, including identifiable intangible assets which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. We base the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination on independent valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management's best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use.\nWe allocate any excess purchase price over the estimated fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, royalty rates, cash flows, discount rates, estimated useful lives and probabilities surrounding the achievement of contingent milestones, could result in different purchase price allocations and amortization expense in current and future periods.\nIn those circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement that meets the definition of a liability under ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments we expect to make as of the acquisition date. We remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value as a component of operating expenses.\nTransaction costs associated with acquisitions are expensed as incurred in general and administrative expenses. Results of operations and cash flows of acquired companies are included in our operating results from the date of acquisition.\nPurchased Intangible Assets\nAcquired intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are related to purchased in-process research and development, or IPR&D, projects and are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. We do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets would be deemed finite-lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives at that point in time.\nWe test IPR&D for impairment on an annual basis and in between annual tests if we become aware of any events or changes that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair values of the assets are below their carrying amounts. The IPR&D annual impairment test is performed as of December 1 of each year. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, then there is no impairment. Impairment losses on indefinite-lived intangible assets are recognized based solely on a comparison of the fair value of the asset to its carrying value, without consideration of any recoverability test. We have not identified any such impairment losses to date.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We then compare the carrying amounts of the assets with the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset over the asset's fair value determined using discounted estimates of future cash flows. We have not identified any such impairment losses to date.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of\nthese assets may not be recoverable. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of December 1 of each year.\nWe first conduct an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then conduct a two-step test for impairment of goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and no further analysis is required. If the carrying values of the reporting unit exceed its fair value, then the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference would be recorded.\nWarrants\nIn 2015, we issued warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in connection with a debt financing. We account for these warrants as equity based on the estimated fair value on the issuance date. The fair", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the Section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A, and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nBusiness Overview\nWe are a molecular diagnostics company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of clinically differentiated, high-value diagnostic surveillance solutions for transplant patients. Our first commercialized testing solution, the AlloMap heart transplant molecular test, or AlloMap, is a gene expression test that helps clinicians monitor and identify heart transplant recipients with stable graft function who have a low probability of moderate/severe acute cellular rejection. Since 2008, we have sought to expand the adoption and utilization of our AlloMap solution through ongoing studies to substantiate the clinical utility and actionability of AlloMap, secure positive reimbursement decisions for AlloMap from large private and public payers, develop and enhance our relationships with key members of the transplant community, including opinion leaders at major transplant centers, and explore opportunities and technologies for the development of additional solutions for post-transplant surveillance. We believe the use of AlloMap, in conjunction with other clinical indicators, can help healthcare providers and their patients better manage long-term care following a heart transplant. In particular, we believe AlloMap can improve patient care by helping healthcare providers to avoid the use of unnecessary, invasive surveillance biopsies and to determine the appropriate dosage levels of immunosuppressants. We are also pursuing the development of additional products for transplant monitoring using a variety of technologies, including AlloSure, our next-generation sequencing-based test to detect donor-derived cell-free DNA, or dd-cfDNA after transplantation.\nSince the launch of AlloMap in January 2005 we have performed more than 81,000 commercial AlloMap tests, including 13,000 tests in 2015, in our Brisbane, California laboratory. In 2015, the test was used in 120 of the approximately 130 heart transplant management centers in the U.S. We believe that there is an opportunity for AlloMap outside of the U.S. and through recent partnerships we have expanded the AlloMap offering to Europe. We believe that we are not currently capacity constrained and that our current facility can support a substantial increase in AlloMap testing volume.\nReimbursement for AlloMap tests comes primarily from Medicare, private third party payers such as insurance companies and managed care organizations, hospitals and state Medicaid programs. Tests performed on patients covered by Medicare represented 36%, 37% and 39% of all AlloMap tests in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. A number of payers have adopted coverage policies approving AlloMap tests for reimbursement. Such policies often approve reimbursement for tests performed from six months or one year post-transplant through five years post-transplant. For tests performed outside the scope of the payer's policy, and for tests performed where the payer has not adopted a coverage policy, we pursue reimbursement on a case-by-case basis. If a reimbursement claim is denied, we generally pursue the appeals process for the particular payer.\nSince our inception, we have generated significant net losses. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $173.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a net loss of $13.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized net income of $0.8 million and for the year ended 2013, we incurred a net loss of $3.5 million.\nRecent Developments\nAllenex Tender Offer\nOn December 16, 2015, we entered into Conditional Share Purchase Agreements, or Purchase Agreements, to acquire, subject to certain conditions, approximately 78% of the outstanding shares of Allenex AB, or Allenex, from\nits three principal shareholders in exchange for a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. On February 8, 2016, the parties entered into amendments to such Purchase Agreements to adjust the shares of our common stock issuable per share of Allenex, and change the timing of distribution of cash consideration. On March 7, 2016, we launched a tender offer, or the Offer, through the issuance of an Offer Document to acquire the remaining 22% of the shares of Allenex. Additionally, if in the Offer we acquire more than 90%, but less than 100%, of the shares of Allenex, which is necessary to initiate compulsory acquisition proceedings under Swedish laws, we intend to purchase the remaining shares in Allenex for cash, pursuant to such compulsory acquisition proceedings.\nOur tender offer to the shareholders of Allenex permits such shareholders to elect either an all cash payment or a mix of cash consideration and shares of our common stock. Under the all cash alternative, the shareholders of Allenex may exchange their shares of Allenex for approximately $0.30 per share. Under the mixed consideration alternative, the shareholders of Allenex may exchange their shares of Allenex for a combination of (i) $0.20 per share and (ii) 0.01458 shares of our common stock per share. We anticipate completing the tender offer in April 2016. If we acquire all Allenex shares, the total purchase price for Allenex will be approximately $35.0 million, payable in a combination of cash and equity. If the Allenex minority shareholders accept the all cash alternative, together with the cash component payable to the three principal shareholders, we will distribute approximately $27.0 million in cash, excluding financial advisory, legal and accounting fees (which must be paid whether or not the acquisition is completed). If the Allenex minority shareholders elect to receive both shares and a cash payment, we will distribute approximately $24.6 million in cash, excluding financial advisory, legal and accounting fees (which must be paid whether or not the acquisition is completed).\nAllenex is a transplant diagnostics company based in Stockholm, Sweden that develops, manufactures, markets and sells products that help match donor organs with potential recipients prior to transplantation. The acquisition of Allenex will create an international transplantation diagnostics company with product offerings along the pre- and post-transplant continuum. The Olerup SSP line, which addresses Human Leukocyte Antigen, or HLA, testing, and AlloMap are foundational diagnostics which are well recognized by the transplant community. The combined company will have a presence and direct distribution channels in the US and Europe.\nThe acquisition will require us to refinance or amend our existing $16.0 million debt loan with our existing lender. To fund a portion of the proposed acquisition and to refinance our existing loan, on December 15, 2015, we entered into a commitment letter and fee letter, or Commitment Letter, with Oberland Capital SA Davos LLC, collectively with its affiliates and assignees, Oberland Capital, which Commitment Letter was also amended and restated on February 8, 2016. The Commitment Letter sets forth the binding commitment, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth therein, by Oberland Capital to provide a short-term bridge loan of $18.0 million, to be borrowed in connection with the closing of the acquisition. The bridge loan will mature on the date that is six months from the closing date of the bridge loan. Approximately $16.0 million of the proceeds from the bridge loan will be used to repay our outstanding loan agreement with East West Bank. Fees incurred with Oberland Capital and third parties in connection with the bridge loan are estimated to be approximately $1.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively. The loan will be secured by substantially all of our assets. The loan will bear interest at the rate of 20% per annum, and prepayments of the loan will be subject to a prepayment premium of 5% for prepayments during the first month after the closing date for the loan, decreasing by 1% each month thereafter. The loan agreement for the bridge loan will contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, financial covenants and events of default.\nEven with the Oberland Capital bridge loan, the acquisition will consume a significant portion of our current cash and cash equivalents. We will require additional financing to fund our working capital and, within six months following entry into the bridge loan, to refinance the Oberland Capital bridge loan. We are pursuing financing opportunities in both the private and public debt and equity markets through sales of equity or debt securities. On August 10, 2015, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to which we are allowed to sell equity and debt securities. We cannot initiate sales under the Form S-3 until mid-2016.\nAbsent additional funding and assuming completion of the acquisition and entry into the bridge loan, we will exhaust our cash and cash equivalents in July 2016 unless we substantially reduce costs and operations, including research and development and other operating costs. Such costs reductions would significantly impair our ability to operate our business effectively, and raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFinancial Overview\nTesting Revenue\nOur testing revenue is derived from AlloMap tests which represented 99%, 95% and 98% of our total revenue in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our testing revenue depends on a number of factors, including (i) the number of tests performed; (ii) establishment of coverage policies by third-party insurers and government payers; (iii) our ability to collect from payers with whom we do not have positive coverage determination, which often requires that we pursue a case-by-case appeals process; (iv) our ability to recognize revenues on tests billed prior to the establishment of reimbursement policies, contracts or payment histories; (v) our ability to expand into markets outside of the United States; and (vi) how quickly we can successfully commercialize new product offerings.\nWe currently market AlloMap to healthcare providers through our direct sales force that targets transplant centers and their physicians, coordinators and nurse practitioners. The healthcare providers that order the tests and on whose behalf we provide our testing services are generally not responsible for the payment of these services. As of December 31, 2015, the list price of AlloMap was $3,600 per test. However, amounts actually received by us vary from payer to payer based on each payer's internal coverage practices and policies. We generally bill third-party payers upon delivery of an AlloMap score report to the ordering physician. As such, we take the assignment of benefits and the risk of collection from the third-party payer and individual patients.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the number of tests for which results were delivered and billed, but for which the associated revenue had not been recognized because our revenue recognition criteria were not met, and taking into account claim status and possibility of collection, was approximately 4,023 and 3,500, respectively. We cannot provide any assurance as to when, if ever, or to what extent any of these amounts will be collected.\nAlloSure, our development-stage transplant surveillance solution which applies proprietary next generation sequencing to detect and quantitate genetic differences between dd-cfDNA in the blood stream emanating from the donor heart and dd-cfDNA emanating from the transplant recipient, has not yet been commercialized and we do not yet receive any testing revenue from these tests.\nCollaboration and License Revenue\nRevenue from our collaboration and license agreements was not more than 5% of total revenue for each period presented. Collaboration and license agreements may include non-refundable upfront payments, partial or complete reimbursement of research and development costs, contingent payments based on the occurrence of specified events under the agreements, license fees and royalties on sales of products or product candidates if they are successfully commercialized. Note 8 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes descriptions of these agreements. Our performance obligations under the collaboration and license agreements may include the transfer of intellectual property rights in the form of licenses, obligations to provide research and development services and obligations to participate on certain development committees with the collaboration partners. We make judgments that affect the periods over which we recognize revenue. We periodically review our estimated periods of performance based on the progress under each arrangement and account for the impact of any change in estimated periods of performance on a prospective basis.\nCost of Testing\nCost of testing reflects the aggregate costs incurred in delivering our AlloMap test results to clinicians. The components of our cost of testing are materials and service costs, direct labor costs, including stock-based compensation, equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with testing samples, shipping, logistics and specimen processing charges to collect and transport samples and allocated overhead including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities and royalties. Costs associated with performing tests (except\nroyalties) are recorded as the test is processed regardless of whether and when revenue is recognized with respect to that test. Royalties incurred for licensed technology, calculated as a percentage of test revenues, are recorded as license fees in cost of testing at the time the test revenues are recognized.\nRoyalties included in cost of testing are associated with a license from Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., or Roche. In February 2014, we received a demand for arbitration from Roche regarding our claim that the royalty rate being assessed under the Roche license should be reduced. In September 2014, we entered into a settlement and mutual release agreement with Roche whereby (i) for the period beginning July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2014, we agreed to pay the amount of $2.8 million in settlement of past royalties due; (ii) for the period beginning July 1, 2014 through September 30, 2014, we agreed to pay royalties based on the same combination services percentage used to determine the past royalties due; (iii) for the period beginning October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2017, we agreed to a downward adjustment of the combination services percentage used to determine the portion of the AlloMap service that is royalty bearing under the terms of the license; (iv) we agreed to report and pay quarterly royalties within 45 days of the end of each calendar quarter; (v) Roche agreed that, subject to our timely payment of all applicable royalties through such date, no further royalties will be payable by us for periods after September 30, 2017; and (vi) mutual releases by us and Roche of all claims under the license agreement through the settlement date, and (vii) Roche agreed to dismiss the arbitration claims. For all time periods, the contractual royalty rate in the license agreement was or will be applied to the applicable combination services percentage to determine the royalties' payable for the AlloMap service\nWe expect cost of testing to increase, in absolute dollars, as the number of tests we perform increases. However, due to the fixed nature of expenses associated with direct labor, equipment and infrastructure, we expect the cost per test will decrease over time as volume increases.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses represent costs incurred to develop new surveillance solutions such as AlloSure, as well as continued efforts related to our AlloMap test. These expenses include payroll and related expenses, consulting expenses, laboratory supplies, and certain allocated expenses as well as amounts incurred under certain collaborative agreements. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We record accruals for estimated study costs comprised of work performed by contract research organizations under contract terms. We expect our research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we invest in research and discovery work to validate the clinical utility of AlloSure, develop new surveillance solutions and clinical outcomes studies for AlloMap.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses represent costs incurred to sell, promote and increase awareness of our AlloMap test to both clinicians and payers, including education of patients, clinicians and payers. Sales and marketing expenses include payroll and related expenses, educational and promotional expenses, and infrastructure expenses, including allocated facility and overhead costs. Compensation related to sales and marketing includes annual salaries and eligibility for quarterly or semi-annual commissions or bonuses based on the achievement of predetermined sales goals or other management objectives.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include costs for our executive, finance, accounting and human resources functions. Costs consist primarily of payroll and related expenses, professional service fees related to billing and collection, accounting, legal and other contract and administrative services and related infrastructure expenses, including allocated facility and overhead costs. We expect to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and The NASDAQ Global Market, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services. We also expect our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars related to anticipated testing volume and collections growth. Upon completion of our proposed acquisition of Allenex, we also expect our general and administrative expenses will increase as we operate as a global public company.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net is associated with borrowings under our loan agreements.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\nIn 2013 and 2014, Other (expense) income, net is primarily associated with the remeasurement of the estimated fair value of warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock and changes in the estimated fair value of a derivative associated with our subordinated convertible debt in 2014. Convertible preferred stock warrants and the subordinated convertible debt were converted to common stock warrants and common stock, respectively, upon the closing of our initial public offering on July 22, 2014.\nIn 2015, other (expense) income, net is primarily state franchise taxes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Items subject to estimates based on judgments include, but are not limited to: revenue recognition, the valuation of warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock, the determination of the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets, the determination of the accruals for clinical studies, the determination of estimated refunds to be requested from third-party payers, any impairment of long-lived assets and legal contingencies. Actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could affect the results of operations in future periods.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of these accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nTesting Revenue\nWe recognize revenues for tests delivered when the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, which may include a contract or a coverage policy; (ii) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.\nThe first criterion is satisfied when a third-party payer makes a coverage decision or enters into a contractual arrangement with us for the test. The second criterion is satisfied when we perform the test and deliver the test result to the ordering physician. The third criterion is satisfied if the third-party payer's coverage decision or reimbursement contract specifies a price for the test. The fourth criterion is satisfied based on management's judgments regarding the collectability of the fees charged under the arrangement.\nSuch judgments include review of past payment history. AlloMap testing may be considered investigational by some payers and not covered under their reimbursement policies. Others may cover the test, but not pay a set or determinable amount. As a result, in the absence of a reimbursement agreement or sufficient payment history, collectability cannot reasonably be assured so revenue is not recognized at the time the test is delivered.\nIf all criteria set forth above are met, revenue is recognized when the test results are delivered. When the first, third or fourth criteria are not met but third-party payers make a payment to us for tests performed, we recognize revenue on a cash basis in the period in which the payment is received.\nRevenue is recognized on an accrual basis, net of adjustments for differences between amounts billed and the estimated receipts from payers. The amount we expect to collect may be lower than the agreed upon amount due to several factors, such as the amount of patient co-payments, the existence of secondary payers and claim denials. Estimated receipts are based upon historical payment practices of payers. Differences between estimated and actual cash receipts are recorded as an adjustment to revenue, which have been immaterial to date.\nFor tests performed where an agreed upon reimbursement rate and a predictable history of collection exists, such as in the case of Medicare, we recognize revenue upon delivery of a score report to the ordering physician based on the established billing rate less contractual and other adjustments to arrive at the amount that we expect to collect. We determine the amount we expect to collect based on a per payer, per contract or agreement basis, after analyzing historical payment trends. The expected amount is typically lower than the agreed upon reimbursement amount due to several factors, such as the amount of patient co-payments and claim denials. In all other situations, where we do not have sufficient history of collection and are unable to determine a predictable pattern of payment, we recognize revenue upon the receipt of cash. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, approximately 68%, 64% and 64%, respectively, of our testing revenue was recognized on the accrual basis.\nOccasionally, we may receive requests from third-party payers for refunds for previously paid-for tests. We maintain a liability for actual overpayments and estimated future refund claims based on historical experience. Accruals for overpayments and refunds are recorded as a reduction of revenue. The approximate number of delivered AlloMap tests and AlloMap tests for which we recognized revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies discussed above, were as follows:\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AlloMap tests delivered\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AlloMap tests for which revenue was recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AlloMap tests for which revenue was recognized,\ndelivered prior to the period presented\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe did not recognize revenue for the remaining tests because either there was no contract, no coverage policy in place, insufficient payment history or we had not received payment for those tests from a payer. We will continue to make requests for payment from payers and patients and/or appeal payment decisions made by third-party payers. As a result, we may receive payment for a portion of these tests. However, a portion of our requests for payments could be denied or only partially satisfied. If third-party payers agree to pay us for these tests in the future, we will recognize revenue for such tests in the period in which our revenue recognition criteria are met. This will continue to affect the comparability of our revenues from period to period. We regularly review to determine if payers meet our revenue recognition criteria and account for the impact of any change on a prospective basis.\nThe process for determining the appropriate amount expected to be collected involves judgment, and considers such factors as, historical payment trends, current economic conditions and regulatory changes. The ultimate amounts of collections could be different from the amounts we estimate.\nCollaboration and License Revenue\nRevenue from our collaboration and license agreements was not more than 5% of total revenue for each period presented. Collaboration and license agreements may include non-refundable upfront payments, partial or complete reimbursement of research and development costs, contingent payments based on the occurrence of specified events under the agreements, license fees and royalties on sales of products or product candidates if they are successfully commercialized.\nWe recognize collaboration and license revenue based upon the relative-selling-price method which is used to allocate arrangement consideration to all of the units of accounting in an arrangement. We evaluate our collaboration and license agreements to identify the deliverables, determine if the deliverables have stand-alone value, to identify the units of accounting and to allocate arrangement consideration to each unit of accounting based on relative best estimate selling price.\nBusiness Combinations\nIn accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, we determine and allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the business combination date, including identifiable intangible assets which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. We base the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination on independent valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management's best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use.\nWe allocate any excess purchase price over the estimated fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, royalty rates, cash flows, discount rates, estimated useful lives and probabilities surrounding the achievement of contingent milestones, could result in different purchase price allocations and amortization expense in current and future periods.\nIn those circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement that meets the definition of a liability under ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments we expect to make as of the acquisition date. We remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value as a component of operating expenses.\nTransaction costs associated with acquisitions are expensed as incurred in general and administrative expenses. Results of operations and cash flows of acquired companies are included in our operating results from the date of acquisition.\nPurchased Intangible Assets\nAcquired intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are related to purchased in-process research and development, or IPR&D, projects and are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. We do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets would be deemed finite-lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives at that point in time.\nWe test IPR&D for impairment on an annual basis and in between annual tests if we become aware of any events or changes that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair values of the assets are below their carrying amounts. The IPR&D annual impairment test is performed as of December 1 of each year. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, then there is no impairment. Impairment losses on indefinite-lived intangible assets are recognized based solely on a comparison of the fair value of the asset to its carrying value, without consideration of any recoverability test. We have not identified any such impairment losses to date.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We then compare the carrying amounts of the assets with the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset over the asset's fair value determined using discounted estimates of future cash flows. We have not identified any such impairment losses to date.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of\nthese assets may not be recoverable. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of December 1 of each year.\nWe first conduct an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then conduct a two-step test for impairment of goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and no further analysis is required. If the carrying values of the reporting unit exceed its fair value, then the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference would be recorded.\nWarrants\nIn 2015, we issued warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in connection with a debt financing. We account for these warrants as equity based on the estimated fair value on the issuance date. The fair"}
