MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. See the Note about Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for additional information. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nChegg is the leading student-first connected learning platform. Our goal is to help students transition from high school to college to career, with a view to improving student outcomes. We help students study more effectively for college admission exams, find the right college to accomplish their goals, get better grades and test scores while in school and find internships that allow them to gain valuable skills to help them enter the workforce after college. We strive to improve the overall return on investment in education.\nWe match domestic and international students with colleges, universities and other academic institutions (collectively referred to as colleges) in the United States. Students get help finding the best fit school for them and colleges are able to reach the best candidates at a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing. Once in college, we provide a range of products and services to help students save time, save money and get smarter. We offer an extensive print textbook library for rent and sale both on our own and through our strategic partnership with Ingram, which we discuss in more detail below. We also offer eTextbooks for rent and sale. Students can subscribe to our digital services, such as Chegg Study, which provides step-by-step Textbook Solutions and Expert Answers, helping students with their course work. We also have live tutors available to students online, anytime, anywhere through our Chegg Tutors service. Finally, we provide access to internships to help students gain skills that are critical to securing their first job.\nTo deliver services to students, we partner with a variety of third parties. We work with colleges to help shape their incoming classes. We source print textbooks, eTextbooks and supplemental materials directly or indirectly from thousands of publishers in the United States, including Pearson, Cengage Learning, McGraw Hill, Wiley and MacMillan. We have a large network of students and professionals who leverage our platform to tutor in their spare time and employers who leverage our platform to post their internships and jobs. In addition, because we have a large student user base, local and national brands partner with us to reach the college and high school demographic.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we generated net revenues of $301.4 million, $304.8 million and $255.6 million, respectively, and in the same periods had net losses of $59.2 million, $64.8 million and $55.9 million, respectively. We plan to continue to invest in our long-term growth, particularly further investment in the technology that powers our connected learning platform, the development of additional products and services that serve students, and expanding our strategic partnership with Ingram.\nOur strategy for achieving and maintaining profitability is centered upon our ability to utilize Chegg Services to increase student engagement with our connected learning platform. We plan to continue to invest in the expansion of Chegg Services to provide a more compelling and personalized solution and deepen engagement with students. We believe this expanded and deeper penetration of the student demographic will allow us to drive further growth in our enrollment and brand marketing services. In addition, we believe that the investments we have made to achieve our current scale will allow us to drive increased operating margins over time that, together with increased contributions of Chegg Services products, will enable us to accomplish profitability and become cash-flow positive for the long-term. Our ability to accomplish these long-term objectives is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including our ability to attract, retain and increasingly engage the student population, intense competition in our markets, the ability to achieve sufficient contributions to revenue from Chegg Services and other factors described in greater detail in Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nWe have presented revenues for our two product lines, Required Materials and Chegg Services, based on how students view us and the utilization of our products by them. Required Materials includes all products that are essential for students to meet the requirements of their coursework and Chegg Services includes all other products we provide to supplement the requirements and help students with their coursework. Chegg Services also includes our marketing services which help to complete our offering of services to students. More detail on our two product lines is discussed in the next two sections titled \"Required Materials\" and \"Chegg Services.\"\nRequired Materials\nOur Required Materials product line includes the rental and sale of print textbooks and eTextbooks as well as the commission we receive from Ingram. Our web-based, multiplatform eTextbook Reader, eTextbooks and supplemental course materials are available from approximately 120 publishers as of December 31, 2015, which we offer as a rental-equivalent solution and for free to students awaiting the arrival of their print textbook rental. This product line has been highly capital intensive due to the resources required to maintain a print textbook rental library. As a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram, we have exited our warehouse facilities in Kentucky and have transitioned our textbook library to Ingram's facilities helping to free up resources historically required by this product line. We will continue to liquidate our print textbook library through the normal course of our operations and expect it to be fully liquidated at the end of 2016. Until that point, we will continue to rent textbooks and recognize revenues on the textbooks that we own as rental revenues on our consolidated statement of operations through the liquidation period. Once our entire print textbook library has been liquidated, all revenues from print textbook rentals will be commission-based.\nWe have historically capitalized the investment in our print textbook library and record depreciation expense in cost of revenues over its useful life using an estimated liquidation value. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our investment in print textbooks, net of proceeds from textbook liquidation, was an inflow of $6.0 million and an outflow during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 of $54.7 million and $84.3 million, respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2015, investment in our print textbooks, net of proceeds from textbook liquidations, decreased to the point where we received more in proceeds from print textbook liquidations than we invested in new additions to our print textbook library. This is expected to continue through 2016 as we are no longer purchasing textbooks for rental as a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram.\nWe use our website to liquidate print textbooks from our print textbook library, which allows us to generate greater recovery on our print textbooks compared to bulk liquidations, while at the same time providing students substantial savings over the retail price of a new book. We are able to adjust what we liquidate based on expected rental demand. We also use our website to source, on behalf of Ingram, both new and used print textbooks for rental or resale from wholesalers, publishers and students. Purchasing used print textbooks allows us to reduce the investments necessary to maintain the rental catalog while at the same time attracting students to our website by offering more for their textbooks than they could generally get by selling them back to their campus bookstore.\nIn the aggregate, Required Materials revenues were 69%, 78%, and 84% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nChegg Services\nOur Chegg Services are experiencing rapid growth and we expect our partnership with Ingram to accelerate the growth of these offerings by freeing up capital while allowing us to maintain our leadership and brand recognition. Our Chegg Services for students include our connected learning platform, or the Student Hub, our test preparation service currently covering the ACT and SAT exams, online tutoring, our Chegg Study service, College Admissions, Scholarship Services and Internship Services. In addition, we offer enrollment marketing services to colleges, allowing them to reach interested college-bound high school students that use our College Admissions, and Scholarship Services. We also work with leading brands, such as Dell, MasterCard, Microsoft, PayPal, Proctor & Gamble, Red Bull, Shutterfly and Starbucks, to provide students with discounts, promotions and other products that, based on student feedback, delight them. For example, for Red Bull, we inserted a free can of Red Bull in select textbook rental shipments to students and Microsoft sponsored a Free Study Week,\u201d which included free access to our Chegg Study service as well as additional free study materials. All of our brand advertising services and the discounts, promotions and other products provided to students are paid for by the brands.\nStudents typically pay to access Chegg Services such as Chegg Study on a monthly or annual basis, while colleges subscribe to our enrollment marketing services and brands pay us depending on the nature of the campaign. In the aggregate, Chegg Services revenues were 31%, 22% and 16% of net revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nStrategic Partnership with Ingram\nWe expect our partnership with Ingram to accelerate the growth of Chegg Services products by allowing us to utilize capital otherwise spent on the purchase of print textbooks, and at the same time allowing us to maintain our leading position and high brand recognition through our iconic orange boxes. We entered into a definitive inventory purchase and consignment agreement with Ingram that will allow us to focus exclusively on eTextbooks and Chegg Services. Under the agreement, since May 1, 2015, Ingram has been responsible for all new investments in the print textbook library, fulfillment logistics, and has title and risk of loss related to print textbook rentals. As a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram, our revenues include a commission on the total revenues that we earn from Ingram upon their fulfillment of a rental transaction using print textbooks for which Ingram has title and risk of loss. Additionally, we have ceased making additional investments in our print textbook library during 2015 and expect to rent and liquidate our existing inventory of print textbooks during 2016. This new model will allow us to reduce and eventually eliminate the operating expenses we incur to acquire and maintain a print textbook library. As we transition to a fully digital company, we will continue to buy used books on Ingram's behalf including books through our buyback program and invoice Ingram at cost. We will also continue to provide Ingram with extended payment terms in 2016 as we procure print textbooks on behalf of Ingram, before moving to normal payment terms in 2017.\nSeasonality of Our Business\nA substantial majority of our revenues are recognized ratably over the term the student rents our print textbooks and eTextbooks or has access to our Chegg Services. Historically, this has generally resulted in our highest revenues in the fourth quarter as it reflects more days of the academic year and our lowest revenues in the second quarter as colleges conclude their academic year for summer and there are fewer days of rentals. The recognition of revenues from our eTextbooks and Chegg Services will continue to follow this trend. As a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram, revenues from Ingram owned print textbook rental transactions will now be higher in the first and third quarters as we recognize a commission on the transaction rather than recognizing the revenues ratably over the term the student rents our textbooks. The variable expenses associated with our shipments of textbooks and marketing activities are highest in the first and third quarters as shipping and other fulfillment costs and marketing expenses are expensed when incurred, generally at the beginning of academic terms. We expect these variable expenses to decrease for 2016 as we have completely transitioned the shipping and fulfillment activities related to textbooks to Ingram. As a result of these factors, the most concentrated periods for our revenues and expenses do not necessarily coincide and comparisons of our quarterly operating results on a sequential basis may not provide meaningful insight into our overall financial performance. We expect our strategic partnership with Ingram to shift peak revenues in the periods that a student rents a textbook as a result of our revenue sharing agreement such that our revenues will more closely track the academic calendar as our expenses associated with the textbook rental business decrease.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nNet Revenues\nWe derive our revenues from the rental or sale of print textbooks and eTextbooks, and from commissions earned from Ingram from the rental of their textbooks and from Chegg Services, net of allowances for refunds or charge backs from our payment processors, who process payments from credit cards, debit cards and PayPal.\nWe generate revenues from the rental of print textbooks and to a lesser extent, through the sales of print textbooks through our website on a just-in-time basis. Rental revenues for textbooks that we own is recognized ratably over the term of the rental period, generally two to five months. Commissions earned on rental textbooks owned by Ingram are recognized immediately when a student places an order. Revenues from selling textbooks on a just-in-time basis is recognized upon shipment and has comprised approximately 10% of our consolidated revenues on average over the three years ended December 31, 2015. Our customers pay for the rental and sale of print textbooks on our website primarily by credit card, resulting in immediate settlement of our accounts receivable. Net revenues from the rental or sale of print textbooks represented 54%, 70% and 79% of our net revenues in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, reflecting increasing growth in our Chegg Services. Similar to the revenue recognition from print textbooks rentals, revenues from eTextbooks is recognized ratably over the contractual period, generally two to five months or at time of the sale, and our customers pay for these services through payment processors, resulting in immediate settlement of our accounts receivable.\nAs a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram, we recognize less revenues from the rental of print textbooks and our Required Materials, and services revenues includes a commission on the total revenues that we earn from Ingram upon their fulfillment of a rental transaction using books for which Ingram has title and risk of loss.\nWe also generate revenues from Chegg Services that include our Chegg Study service, which we offer to students, online tutoring, College Admissions, Scholarship Services, and Internship Services. We also offer enrollment marketing services to colleges and advertising services that we offer to brands. Chegg Services are offered to students through weekly, monthly or annual subscriptions, and we recognize revenues ratably over the respective subscription period. We primarily offer subscriptions to our Chegg Study service and tutoring services.\nWhen deciding the most appropriate basis for presenting revenues or costs of revenues, both the legal form and substance of the agreement between us and our business partners are reviewed to determine each party's respective role in the transaction. Where our role in a transaction is that of principal, revenues are recognized on a gross basis. This requires revenue to comprise the gross value of the transaction billed to the customer, after trade discounts, with any related expenditure charged as an operating cost. Where our role in a transaction is that of an agent, revenues are recognized on a net basis with revenues representing the margin earned. In relation to our partnership with Ingram and the rental of their textbooks, we recognize revenues on a net basis based on our role in the transaction as an agent.\nMarketing services include enrollment marketing services and brand advertising, which we offer either on a subscription or on an a la carte basis. Enrollment marketing services connect colleges with students seeking admission or scholarship opportunities at these institutions. Brand advertising offers brands unique ways to connect with students. Revenues are recognized ratably or as earned over the subscription service period, generally one year. Revenues from enrollment marketing services or brand advertising delivered on an a la carte basis, without a subscription, are recognized when delivery of the respective lead or service has occurred. For these services, we bill the customer at the inception, over the term of the customer arrangement or as the services are performed. Upon satisfactory assessment of creditworthiness, we generally grant credit to our enrollment marketing services and brand advertising customers with normal credit terms, typically 30 days.\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of advance payments from students related to rentals and subscriptions that have not been recognized and marketing services that have yet to be performed. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenues ratably over the term or when the services are provided and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nCost of Revenues\nOur cost of revenues consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products and services. Cost of revenues include textbook depreciation expense, shipping and other fulfillment costs, the cost of textbooks sold, payment processing costs, write-offs and allowances related to the print textbook library and all expenses associated with our distribution and customer service centers, including personnel and warehousing costs. The cost of textbooks sold, shipping and other fulfillment costs and payment processing expenses are recognized upon shipment, while textbook depreciation is recognized under an accelerated method over the life of the textbook. We believe this method most accurately reflects the actual pattern of decline in the economic value of the assets, resulting in higher costs earlier in the textbook lifecycle. Changes in our cost of revenues may be disproportionate to changes in our revenues because unrecoverable costs, such as outbound shipping and other fulfillment and payment processing fees, are expensed in the period they are incurred while revenues are recognized ratably over the rental term. This effect is particularly pronounced in the first and third quarters, corresponding to the beginning of academic terms. As a result, we could experience quarters in which our cost of revenues exceeds our revenues for the period. In addition, cost of revenues includes the depreciation of our eTextbook Reader software, publisher content fees for eTextbooks and allocated information technology and facilities costs.\nCost of revenues also consists of content amortization expense related to content that we develop or license, including publisher agreements for which we pay one-time license fees for published content, enrollment marketing services leads purchased from third-party suppliers to fulfill leads that we are unable to fulfill through our internal database, personnel costs and other direct costs related to providing content or services. In addition, cost of revenues include allocated information technology and facilities costs.\nWe anticipate that to the extent Chegg Services revenues grow and Ingram fulfills print textbook rental and sale orders, our gross margins will generally improve over time.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses into five categories: technology and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative, restructuring charges and gain on liquidation of textbooks. One of the most significant components of our operating expenses is employee-related costs, which include share-based compensation expenses. We expect to continue to hire new employees in order to support our current and anticipated growth. In any particular period, the timing of additional hires could materially affect our operating expenses, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues. Our costs and expenses\ncontain information technology expenses and facilities expenses such as webhosting, depreciation on our infrastructure systems, our headquarters lease expense and the employee-related costs for information technology support staff. We allocate these costs to each expense category, including cost of revenues, technology and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative. The allocation is primarily based on the headcount in each group at the end of a period. As our business grows, our operating expenses may increase over time to expand capacity and sustain our workforce.\nTechnology and Development\nOur technology and development expenses consist of salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expense for employees in our product and web design, engineering and technical teams who are responsible for maintaining our website, developing new products and improving existing products. Technology and development costs also include amortization of acquired intangible assets, webhosting costs, third-party development costs and allocated information technology and facilities expenses. We expense substantially all of our technology and development expenses as they are incurred. In the past three years, our expenses have increased to support new products and services as well as to expand our infrastructure capabilities to support back-end processes associated with our revenue transactions and internal systems used to manage our print textbook library. We intend to continue making significant investments in developing new products and services and enhancing the functionality of existing products and services.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist of user and advertiser-facing marketing and promotional expenditures through a number of targeted online marketing channels, sponsored search, display advertising, email marketing campaigns and other initiatives. We incur salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expenses for our employees engaged in marketing, business development and sales and sales support functions required for enrollment marketing services and amortization of acquired intangible assets and allocated information technology and facilities costs. Our marketing expenses are largely variable; and we tend to incur these in the first and third quarters of the year due to our efforts to target students at the beginning of academic terms. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense. Sales and marketing expenses also include lead generation services and sales commissions for our enrollment marketing services and brand advertising.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expense for certain executives as well as our finance, legal, human resources and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include outside consulting, legal and accounting services, provision for doubtful accounts and allocated information technology and facilities costs. We expect to incur additional costs when we transition from an emerging growth company\u201d including increased audit, legal, regulatory and other related fees.\nRestructuring Charges\nRestructuring charges are primarily comprised of severance costs, contract and program termination costs, asset impairments and costs of facility consolidation and closure. Restructuring charges are recorded upon approval of a formal management plan and are included in the operating results of the period in which such plan is approved and the expense becomes estimable.\nGain on Liquidation of Textbooks\nGain on liquidation of textbooks consists of proceeds we receive from the sale of previously rented print textbooks, through our website or to wholesalers and other channels, offset by the net book value of such textbooks. Our gain on liquidation of textbooks is driven by several factors including age of the books liquidated, the volume of books liquidated at a given point in time and the channel through which we liquidate. When the proceeds received exceed the net book value of the textbooks liquidated, we record a gain on liquidation of textbooks.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net consists primarily of interest expense on our debt obligations, changes in the fair value of our preferred stock warrants and interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Due to the uncertainty as to the realization of the benefits of our domestic deferred tax assets, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against such assets. We intend to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our historical consolidated statements of operations (in thousands, except percentage of revenues):\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td>

year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $3.5 million, or 1%, compared to the same period in 2014. Rental revenues decreased $61.2 million or 34%, while services revenues increased $44.5 million, or 51%, and sales revenues increased $13.2 million, or 37%.\nNet revenues in the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $49.3 million, or 19%, compared to the same period in 2013. Rental revenues decreased $7.4 million or 4%, while services revenues increased $35.5 million, or 68%, and sales revenues increased $21.2 million, or 145%.\nThe decrease in rental revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was due to our strategic partnership with Ingram, which commenced in July 2014. As a result of our strategic partnership, our rental revenues are increasingly classified as services revenues to represent the commission on the total revenues that we earn from Ingram upon their fulfillment of a rental transaction using books for which Ingram has title and risk of loss rather than recognizing rental revenues from transactions using our print textbooks. The increase in services and sales revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was driven primarily from growth across our other offerings for students which included increased revenues from Chegg Study, eTextbooks, and our various acquisitions in 2014 as well as an increase in the commissions earned from Ingram.\nThe following table sets forth our net revenues for the periods shown for our Required Materials and Chegg Services product lines (dollars in thousands):\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Required Materials\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>207,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>213,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29,629\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chegg Services\n</td> <td>94,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>304,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>255,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,461\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRequired Materials revenues decreased $29.6 million, or 13%, in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 primarily due to our partnership with Ingram. Because our Required Materials revenues are increasingly comprised of a commission earned from Ingram rather than the full revenues from a print textbook rental transaction, we expect this to continue to decrease throughout 2016 as we transition investments in the print textbook library and logistics and fulfillment for print textbook rental orders to Ingram. Required Materials revenues represented 69% and 78% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Chegg Services revenues increased $26.2 million, or 38%, in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014 due to growth in new memberships for our Chegg Study service. Chegg Services represented 31% and 22% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nNet revenues in the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $49.3 million, or 19%, compared to the same period during 2013. Of this increase, Required Materials revenues increased $23.0 million or 11%, while, Chegg Services revenues increased $26.3 million, or 63%, compared to the same period in 2013. The increase in Required Materials revenues is primarily due to an increase in just in time sales during our peak rush period and an increase in eTextbook volumes with an offsetting decrease in rental revenues in the period as compared to 2013. The increase in Chegg Services revenues were due primarily from growth in new memberships of our Chegg Study service, growth in our enrollment marketing services and revenues from acquisitions completed in 2014.\nCost of Revenues\nThe following table sets forth our cost of revenues for the periods shown (dollars in thousands):\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,136\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Includes share-based compensation expense of:\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(355\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(568\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $21.1 million, or 10%, compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in textbook depreciation of $26.6 million, write-offs related to our print textbook library of $5.2 million and lower warehouse personnel costs of $5.6 million. These decreases resulted from Ingram's fulfillment of more print textbook rental orders and the closure of our warehouse in Kentucky. These savings were partially offset by higher cost related to sales of print textbooks of $15.5 million and the cost of digital content of $1.6 million. As a result, gross margins increased to 37% in the year ended December 31, 2015, from 31% in the year ended December 31, 2014, as Chegg Services continued to be a larger percentage of our business.\nCost of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $35.9 million, or 21%, compared to the same period during 2013. The increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to an increase in textbook depreciation of $5.4 million, write-offs related to our textbook library of $4.7 million, the cost of digital content of $4.4 million, and higher warehouse personnel costs of $0.5 million. The cost of digital content increased during the year ended December 31, 2014 due to our expansion of digital content solutions made available to students. In addition we experienced an increase in the cost of textbooks purchased of $16.2 million, which was primarily driven by increased unit shipments and we had higher order fulfillment costs of $4.4 million, which is primarily comprised of shipping and handling expenses.\nFurther, as we move towards Ingram taking title and risk of loss for the print textbook inventory needed to fulfill all print textbooks rentals and sales, we anticipate our total cost of revenues will continue to decrease and our total gross margins will continually increase.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table sets

In addition, expenses for outside services increased $1.4 million and web hosting and software licensing fees increased $0.9 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Technology and development as a percentage of net revenues were 20% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 16% of net revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTechnology and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $7.4 million, or 18%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2014 our employee-related expenses and share-based compensation expenses increased $3.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively, compared to the same period in 2013. Share-based compensation expense increased primarily due to focal grants given during the year as well as new hire grants which included those employees brought on as part of our various acquisitions in 2014. In addition, we experienced an increase in outside services of $2.6 million as well as $1.5 million increase in web hosting and software licensing fees as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Amortization of our intangibles decreased $0.7 million related to our acquisitions made in previous years. Technology and development as a percentage of net revenues was 16% of net revenues in both the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $8.2 million, or 11%, compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in employee-related and share-based compensation expense that decreased $5.0 million and $3.4 million, respectively, compared to the years ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was partially offset by advertising and marketing expenses that increased $2.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 21% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 24% of net revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nSales and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $22.0 million, or 44%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in advertising and marketing expenses of $4.2 million as a result of search engine marketing to increase customer acquisition and online or social media marketing during the period compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2014 our employee-related expenses and share-based compensation increased $9.2 million and $4.2 million, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in employee related expenses increased primarily due to a higher average headcount and acquisition related retention bonuses and share-based compensation increased primarily due to focal grants given during the year as well as new hire grants, which included those employees brought on as part of our various acquisitions in 2014. Amortization of our intangibles increased $1.3 million related to our acquisitions made in 2014. In addition, in 2014, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.6 million related to acquisition related intangibles as a result of our decision to exit the print coupon business. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 24% during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 20% of net revenues during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $3.4 million, or 8%, compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was due to higher employee-related expenses and share-based compensation expenses that increased $1.7 million and $4.1 million, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, which was partially offset by a decrease in professional fees and outside services of $1.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 15% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 14% of net revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $1.4 million, or 3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase in employee-related and benefit expenses, audit and legal fees, and insurance by $5.9 million, as a result of Chegg now being a publicly traded company, partially offset with a decrease in share-based compensation expense of $4.7 million primarily due to higher expenses in the prior year resulting from the completion of our IPO. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 14% during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 16% of net revenues during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nRestructuring Charges\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded restructuring charges of $4.9 million related to the exit from our print coupon business and closing our Kentucky warehouse. These charges include one-time employee termination benefits for approximately 71 employees of $1.9 million and lease termination and other costs of $3.0 million. As a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram, we have successfully exited our warehouse facilities in the year ended December 31, 2015. Costs incurred to date related to employee termination benefits are expected to be paid within the next three months. Costs incurred to date related to the lease termination and other costs are expected to be fully paid by 2021.\nGain on Liquidation of Textbooks\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we had a gain on liquidation of print textbooks of $4.3 million, $4.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively, resulting from proceeds received from liquidation of previously rented print textbooks on our website and through various other liquidation channels.\nInterest Expense and Other Income, Net\nThe following table sets forth our interest expense and other income, net, for the periods shown (dollars in thousands):\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(247\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(317\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,818\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(359\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(663\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(75\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(345\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest expense and other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,177\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(593\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(106\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(113\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense, net decreased during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we reduced our line of credit to $30.0 million. Interest expense, net decreased by $3.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the pay-off of our outstanding loan balance in 2013.\nOther income (expense), net decreased during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the interest earned on our investments. Other income (expense), net was a net income during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the interest earned on our investments.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following table sets forth our provision for income taxes for the periods shown (dollars in thousands):\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>695\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(456\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recorded an income tax provision of approximately $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was primarily due to state and foreign income tax expense and federal tax expense related to the tax amortization of acquired indefinite lived intangible assets. We recorded an income tax provision of approximately $0.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily the result of the release of a valuation allowance of $1.3 million resulting from our acquisition of InstaEDU, offset by foreign and state income taxes. We recorded an income tax provision of $0.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 that was comprised of state and foreign income tax expense.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2015 our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $89.1 million, which were held for working capital purposes. Our cash equivalents and investments are composed primarily of commercial paper, corporate securities, money market funds and agency bonds. We also have an aggregate principal amount of $30.0 million available under our revolving credit facility with an accordion feature that, subject to certain financial criteria, allows us to borrow up to a total of $65.0 million. The revolving credit facility expires in August 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility.\nAs a result of our expanded strategic partnership with Ingram, we will continue to buy used print textbooks on Ingram's behalf, including print textbooks through our buyback program, and invoice Ingram at cost. We provided Ingram with extended payment terms in 2015 and will continue to do so in 2016 for the purchase of print textbooks, before moving to normal payment terms in 2017. We have a reimbursement balance due from Ingram included within other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet related to the purchase of these textbooks of $28.9 million as of December 31, 2015. As a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram, we anticipate having significantly more working capital.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, our proceeds from print textbook liquidations exceeded our investment in print textbooks and resulted in a cash inflow of $6.0 million as a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram whereby we no longer make new investments in the print textbook library and since May 1, 2015, Ingram was responsible for all new investments in the print textbook library. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 our investment in print textbooks, net of proceeds from textbook liquidations was $54.7 million and $84.3 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have incurred cumulative losses of $329.1 million from our operations and we expect to incur additional losses in the future. Our operations have been financed primarily by net proceeds from the sales of shares of our convertible preferred stock, through various debt financing activities and our IPO.\nWe believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth, our investments in technology and development activities, our acquisition of new products and services and our sales and marketing activities. To the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to adequately fund our business plans and it could have a negative effect on our business, operating cash flows and financial condition.\nMost of our cash is held in the United States. As of December 31, 2015 our foreign subsidiaries held an insignificant amount of cash in foreign jurisdictions. We currently do not intend or foresee a need to repatriate these funds. In addition, based on our current and future needs, we believe our current funding and capital resources for our international operations are adequate.\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows (in thousands):\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(82\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(87,350\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(153,090\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,872\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>145,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nAlthough we incurred net losses during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our net losses were partially or fully offset by non-cash expenditures. The substantial majority of our net revenues is from e-commerce transactions with students, which are settled immediately through payment processors, as opposed to our accounts payable, which are settled based on contractual payment terms with our suppliers. As a result, changes in our operating accounts are generally a source of cash overall, although they can be a use of cash in the second and fourth quarters of each year as payables become due and new orders are generally at their low point. In addition, we have significant non-cash operating expenses such as print textbook\nlibrary depreciation expense, other depreciation and amortization expense and share-based compensation expense.\nNet cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $0.1 million. Our net loss of $59.2 million was increased by the change in our prepaid expenses and other current assets of $27.9 million and partially offset by significant non-cash operating expenses, including print textbook library depreciation expense of $43.6 million, other depreciation and amortization expense of $11.7 million, share-based compensation expense of $38.8 million and loss from write-offs of print textbooks of $5.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we saw a decline in our textbook depreciation expense and an increase in the change of our prepaid expenses and other current assets, which was a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram, where we are no longer making investments in our print textbook inventory yet continue to buy books on Ingram's behalf, while providing them with extended payment terms. The effects of these two items were the primary reasons we had net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was $68.5 million. Although we incurred a net loss of $64.8 million, our net loss was more than offset by significant non-cash operating expenses, including print textbook library depreciation expense of $70.1 million, other depreciation and amortization expense of $11.3 million, share-based compensation expense of $36.9 million and loss from write-offs of print textbooks of $10.5 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2013 was $63.7 million. Although we incurred a net loss of $55.9 million, our net loss was more than offset by significant non-cash operating expenses, including print textbook library depreciation expense of $64.8 million, other depreciation and amortization expense of $11.6 million, share-based compensation expense of $37.0 million and loss from write-offs of print textbooks of $5.9 million.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash flows from investing activities have been primarily related to the purchase of print textbooks, marketable securities and property and equipment, offset by proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities and the proceeds from the liquidation of print textbooks.\nNet cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $8.3 million and was primarily used for the purchase of print textbooks of $32.3 million, purchase of marketable securities of $35.6 million, purchase of property and equipment of $8.3 million, and the purchase of a strategic equity investment in a third party of $2.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale or maturity of marketable securities of $48.2 million and proceeds from the liquidation of print textbooks of $38.3 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was $87.4 million and was primarily used for the acquisition of businesses of $53.9 million, purchase of print textbooks of $112.8 million, purchase of marketable securities of $70.7 million and purchase of property and equipment of $5.1 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale or maturity of marketable securities of $97.1 million and proceeds from the liquidation of print textbooks of $58.1 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2013 was $153.1 million and was primarily used for purchase of print textbooks of $122.2 million, purchase of marketable securities of $61.4 million and purchase of property and equipment and other assets of $7.4 million, partially offset by proceeds from liquidation of print textbooks of $37.9 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $2.7 million and was primarily related to the proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock plans totaling $13.7 million partially offset by the payment of $8.7 million in taxes related to the net share settlement of restricted stock units (RSUs) which became fully vested during the period, as well as the repurchase of common stock of $2.3 million associated with a put option granted in connection with a prior acquisition.\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1.9 million and was primarily related to the payment of $4.0 million in taxes related to the net share settlement of RSUs which became fully vested during the period offset by the issuance of common stock under stock plans totaling $2.7 million, as well as the repurchase of common stock of $0.6 million associated with a put option granted in connection with a prior acquisition.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2013 was $145.2 million and was related to net proceeds received from our IPO and the exercise of stock options, partially offset by the pay-off of our revolving credit facility.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following is a summary of the contractual commitments associated with our debt and lease obligations (which include the related interest) as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

</tr>\n</table>\n_____________________________________________________\n(1) Our office and warehouse facilities are leased under operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2021.\nAs a result of our expanded partnership with Ingram and the exit of our Kentucky warehouse during the year ended December 31, 2015, we signed an agreement on April 10, 2015 to sublease effectively one half of our warehouse in Kentucky. We expect this sublease agreement to generate $0.1 million of sublease income per month through the end of November 2016.\nIn addition, our other liabilities include $2.1 million related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2015. The timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond one year. As a result, this amount is not included in the above table.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThrough December 31, 2015, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. We believe that assumptions and estimates of the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nWe evaluate whether we are acting as a principal or an agent, and therefore whether we would record the gross sales amount and related costs as revenues or the net amount earned as commissions from the sale of third-party products. Our determination is based on our evaluation of certain indicators including whether we are the principal in the transaction, are\nsubject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, none of which is presumptive or determinative. Our evaluation requires management to make a judgment based on the terms of arrangement in our determination of whether we act as a principal or an agent. If our evaluation of an arrangement was incorrect, this could impact our revenue recognition and cost of revenues amount in a given period.\nSome of our customer arrangements for enrollment marketing services include multiple deliverables, which include the delivery of student leads as well as other services to the end customer. We have determined these deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting, as they have value to the customer on a standalone basis and our arrangements do not contain a right of return. For these arrangements that contain multiple deliverables, we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy, which includes: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), when available; (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (TPE), if VSOE does not exist; and (iii) estimated selling price (ESP), if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\nWe determine VSOE based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific solution when sold separately and when a substantial majority of the selling prices for these services fall within a narrow range. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Generally our go-to-market strategy differs from that of our peers, and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of services with similar functionality cannot be obtained.\nAs we have not established VSOE or TPE for our enrollment marketing services, we have used ESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. We have determined ESP by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, prices charged for similar offerings, sales volume, geographies, market conditions, the competitive landscape and pricing practices. Our determination of ESP requires management to make a judgment in which factors to consider when determining ESP. If different factors were considered we could conclude a different determination of ESP and this could have a material impact to the amount of revenues recognized. We believe the factors considered best represent the price at which we would transact a sale if the services were sold on a standalone basis, and we regularly assess the method used to determine ESP.\nTextbook Library\nFactors considered in the determination of print textbook allowances impacting cost of revenues and our consolidated statements of operations include historical experience, management's knowledge of current business conditions and expectations of future demand. The consideration of these factors requires management to make judgments in the determination of our allowance for lost or damaged books in any given period.\nWe depreciate our print textbooks, less an estimated salvage value, over an estimated useful life of three years using an accelerated method of depreciation, as we estimate this method most accurately reflects the actual pattern of decline in the economic value of the assets as described below. The salvage value considers the historical trend and projected liquidation proceeds for textbooks. The useful life is determined based on the time period in which the textbooks are held and rented before liquidation. In accordance with our policy, we review the estimated useful lives of our textbook library on an ongoing basis.\nWe will continue to review the accelerated method of depreciation to ensure consistency with the value of the print textbook to the customer during its useful life. Based on historical experience, we believe that a print textbook has more value to our customers and us early in its useful life and therefore an accelerated depreciation method reflects the actual pattern of decline in economic value and aligns with the textbook's condition, which may deteriorate over time. In addition, we consider the utilization of the textbooks and the rental revenues we can earn, recognizing that a used textbook rents for a lower amount than a new textbook. Should the actual rental activity or deterioration of books differ from our estimates, our loss (gain) on liquidation of textbooks or write-offs could differ.\nIn addition, we evaluate the appropriateness of the estimated salvage value and estimated useful life based on historical liquidation transactions with both vendors and customers and reviewing a blend of actual and estimates of the lifecycle of each book and the number of times rented before it is liquidated, respectively. Our estimates utilize data from historical experience, including actual proceeds from liquidated textbooks as a percentage of original sourcing costs, channel mix of liquidations and consideration of the estimated sales price, largely driven by the average market price data of used books and the projected values of a book in relation to the original source cost over time. Changes in the estimated salvage value, method of depreciation or useful life can have a significant impact on our depreciation expense, write-offs liquidations and gross margins.\nAs we continue to accumulate additional data related to our textbook library, we may make refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our depreciation expense, write-offs and liquidations.\nDepreciation expense and write-offs of print textbooks are recorded in cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our print textbook library depreciation expense was approximately $43.6 million, $70.1 million and $64.8 million, respectively, and write-offs were approximately $5.3 million, $10.5 million and $5.9 million, respectively.\nImpairment of Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess the impairment of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in determining when to perform an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends or significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. When measuring the recoverability of these assets, we will make assumptions regarding our estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If our estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to impair these assets. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we determined that we would not continue to support or look to expand our print coupon business, resulting in a significant decrease in the expected future cash flows. As a result an impairment analysis was performed based on a discounted cash flow analysis with key assumptions based on the future revenues expected until the services were removed from our website. The analysis indicated that the carrying amounts of the intangible assets acquired will not be fully recoverable, resulting in an impairment charge totaling $1.6 million, which is included in sales and marketing operating expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had intangible assets, net, of $8.9 million and $13.6 million, respectively.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. In our qualitative assessment, we consider factors including economic conditions, industry and market conditions and developments, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific events in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. Our qualitative assessment requires management to make a judgment based on the factors listed above in our determination. Should we conclude that it is more likely than not that our recorded goodwill amounts have been impaired, we would perform a two-step impairment test. The two-step impairment test requires us to perform a valuation of our goodwill. When performing the valuation of our goodwill, we make assumptions regarding our estimated future cash flows to determine the fair value of our business. If our estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment loss related to our goodwill. We have not recognized any impairment of goodwill since our inception. As of each of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we have goodwill of $91.3 million.\nIndefinite Lived Intangibles\nWe make judgments about the recoverability of purchased indefinite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. We perform an annual impairment assessment on October 1 of each year for indefinite-lived intangible assets, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. The assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines.\nShare-based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize share-based compensation expense for all awards made to employees, directors and consultants, including stock options, RSUs, performance-based RSUs (PSUs) and our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) based on estimated fair values.\nThe fair value of stock options and shares to be purchased under our ESPP is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model which includes assumptions for the expected term, risk-free interest rate, expected volatility and expected dividends.\nThe Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model utilizes the fair value of our common stock based on an active market and requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock.\nThese assumptions represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. The assumptions required are estimated as follows:\nExpected term. The expected term for options granted to employees, officers and directors is calculated as the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the options. The expected term for options granted to consultants is determined using the remaining contractual life. The expected term for shares to be purchased under our ESPP is calculated as the length of the offering period which is generally six months.\nRisk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on the United States treasury zero-coupon issues, with a remaining term equal to the expected term.\nExpected volatility. The expected volatility historically was based on the average volatility of similar public entities within our peer group. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2015, we have utilized the average volatility of our share price as we now have over two years of trading history.\nExpected dividends. The dividend assumption is based on our historical experience. To date we have not paid any dividends on our common stock.\nIn addition to assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the share-based compensation expense related to our awards. Estimated forfeitures are determined based on historical data and management's expectation of exercise behaviors. We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover and other factors. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our share-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the share-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the share-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements.\nShare-based compensation expense recognized related to PSUs is subject to the achievement of performance objectives and requires significant judgment by management in determining the current level of attainment of such performance objectives. Management may consider factors such as the latest revenue forecasts and general business trends in the assessment of whether or not a PSU award will be obtained. Subsequent changes to these considerations may have a material impact on the amount of share-based compensation expense recognized in the period related to PSU awards, which may lead to volatility of share-based compensation expense period-to-period.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our share-based compensation expense on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates, which could materially impact our future share-based compensation expense.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. We currently are providing a valuation allowance on domestic deferred tax assets. If or when recognizing deferred tax assets in the future, we will consider all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations.\nWe record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, we recognize the tax benefit as the largest amount that is cumulative more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor relevant recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2-Significant Accounting Policies of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition and operations of Chegg, a student-first connected learning platform.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. See the Note about Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for additional information. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nChegg is the leading student-first connected learning platform. Our goal is to help students transition from high school to college to career, with a view to improving student outcomes. We help students study more effectively for college admission exams, find the right college to accomplish their goals, get better grades and test scores while in school and find internships that allow them to gain valuable skills to help them enter the workforce after college. We strive to improve the overall return on investment in education.\nWe match domestic and international students with colleges, universities and other academic institutions (collectively referred to as colleges) in the United States. Students get help finding the best fit school for them and colleges are able to reach the best candidates at a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing. Once in college, we provide a range of products and services to help students save time, save money and get smarter. We offer an extensive print textbook library for rent and sale both on our own and through our strategic partnership with Ingram, which we discuss in more detail below. We also offer eTextbooks for rent and sale. Students can subscribe to our digital services, such as Chegg Study, which provides step-by-step Textbook Solutions and Expert Answers, helping students with their course work. We also have live tutors available to students online, anytime, anywhere through our Chegg Tutors service. Finally, we provide access to internships to help students gain skills that are critical to securing their first job.\nTo deliver services to students, we partner with a variety of third parties. We work with colleges to help shape their incoming classes. We source print textbooks, eTextbooks and supplemental materials directly or indirectly from thousands of publishers in the United States, including Pearson, Cengage Learning, McGraw Hill, Wiley and MacMillan. We have a large network of students and professionals who leverage our platform to tutor in their spare time and employers who leverage our platform to post their internships and jobs. In addition, because we have a large student user base, local and national brands partner with us to reach the college and high school demographic.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we generated net revenues of $301.4 million, $304.8 million and $255.6 million, respectively, and in the same periods had net losses of $59.2 million, $64.8 million and $55.9 million, respectively. We plan to continue to invest in our long-term growth, particularly further investment in the technology that powers our connected learning platform, the development of additional products and services that serve students, and expanding our strategic partnership with Ingram.\nOur strategy for achieving and maintaining profitability is centered upon our ability to utilize Chegg Services to increase student engagement with our connected learning platform. We plan to continue to invest in the expansion of Chegg Services to provide a more compelling and personalized solution and deepen engagement with students. We believe this expanded and deeper penetration of the student demographic will allow us to drive further growth in our enrollment and brand marketing services. In addition, we believe that the investments we have made to achieve our current scale will allow us to drive increased operating margins over time that, together with increased contributions of Chegg Services products, will enable us to accomplish profitability and become cash-flow positive for the long-term. Our ability to accomplish these long-term objectives is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including our ability to attract, retain and increasingly engage the student population, intense competition in our markets, the ability to achieve sufficient contributions to revenue from Chegg Services and other factors described in greater detail in Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nWe have presented revenues for our two product lines, Required Materials and Chegg Services, based on how students view us and the utilization of our products by them. Required Materials includes all products that are essential for students to meet the requirements of their coursework and Chegg Services includes all other products we provide to supplement the requirements and help students with their coursework. Chegg Services also includes our marketing services which help to complete our offering of services to students. More detail on our two product lines is discussed in the next two sections titled \"Required Materials\" and \"Chegg Services.\"\nRequired Materials\nOur Required Materials product line includes the rental and sale of print textbooks and eTextbooks as well as the commission we receive from Ingram. Our web-based, multiplatform eTextbook Reader, eTextbooks and supplemental course materials are available from approximately 120 publishers as of December 31, 2015, which we offer as a rental-equivalent solution and for free to students awaiting the arrival of their print textbook rental. This product line has been highly capital intensive due to the resources required to maintain a print textbook rental library. As a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram, we have exited our warehouse facilities in Kentucky and have transitioned our textbook library to Ingram's facilities helping to free up resources historically required by this product line. We will continue to liquidate our print textbook library through the normal course of our operations and expect it to be fully liquidated at the end of 2016. Until that point, we will continue to rent textbooks and recognize revenues on the textbooks that we own as rental revenues on our consolidated statement of operations through the liquidation period. Once our entire print textbook library has been liquidated, all revenues from print textbook rentals will be commission-based.\nWe have historically capitalized the investment in our print textbook library and record depreciation expense in cost of revenues over its useful life using an estimated liquidation value. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our investment in print textbooks, net of proceeds from textbook liquidation, was an inflow of $6.0 million and an outflow during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 of $54.7 million and $84.3 million, respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2015, investment in our print textbooks, net of proceeds from textbook liquidations, decreased to the point where we received more in proceeds from print textbook liquidations than we invested in new additions to our print textbook library. This is expected to continue through 2016 as we are no longer purchasing textbooks for rental as a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram.\nWe use our website to liquidate print textbooks from our print textbook library, which allows us to generate greater recovery on our print textbooks compared to bulk liquidations, while at the same time providing students substantial savings over the retail price of a new book. We are able to adjust what we liquidate based on expected rental demand. We also use our website to source, on behalf of Ingram, both new and used print textbooks for rental or resale from wholesalers, publishers and students. Purchasing used print textbooks allows us to reduce the investments necessary to maintain the rental catalog while at the same time attracting students to our website by offering more for their textbooks than they could generally get by selling them back to their campus bookstore.\nIn the aggregate, Required Materials revenues were 69%, 78%, and 84% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nChegg Services\nOur Chegg Services are experiencing rapid growth and we expect our partnership with Ingram to accelerate the growth of these offerings by freeing up capital while allowing us to maintain our leadership and brand recognition. Our Chegg Services for students include our connected learning platform, or the Student Hub, our test preparation service currently covering the ACT and SAT exams, online tutoring, our Chegg Study service, College Admissions, Scholarship Services and Internship Services. In addition, we offer enrollment marketing services to colleges, allowing them to reach interested college-bound high school students that use our College Admissions, and Scholarship Services. We also work with leading brands, such as Dell, MasterCard, Microsoft, PayPal, Proctor & Gamble, Red Bull, Shutterfly and Starbucks, to provide students with discounts, promotions and other products that, based on student feedback, delight them. For example, for Red Bull, we inserted a free can of Red Bull in select textbook rental shipments to students and Microsoft sponsored a Free Study Week,\u201d which included free access to our Chegg Study service as well as additional free study materials. All of our brand advertising services and the discounts, promotions and other products provided to students are paid for by the brands.\nStudents typically pay to access Chegg Services such as Chegg Study on a monthly or annual basis, while colleges subscribe to our enrollment marketing services and brands pay us depending on the nature of the campaign. In the aggregate, Chegg Services revenues were 31%, 22% and 16% of net revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nStrategic Partnership with Ingram\nWe expect our partnership with Ingram to accelerate the growth of Chegg Services products by allowing us to utilize capital otherwise spent on the purchase of print textbooks, and at the same time allowing us to maintain our leading position and high brand recognition through our iconic orange boxes. We entered into a definitive inventory purchase and consignment agreement with Ingram that will allow us to focus exclusively on eTextbooks and Chegg Services. Under the agreement, since May 1, 2015, Ingram has been responsible for all new investments in the print textbook library, fulfillment logistics, and has title and risk of loss related to print textbook rentals. As a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram, our revenues include a commission on the total revenues that we earn from Ingram upon their fulfillment of a rental transaction using print textbooks for which Ingram has title and risk of loss. Additionally, we have ceased making additional investments in our print textbook library during 2015 and expect to rent and liquidate our existing inventory of print textbooks during 2016. This new model will allow us to reduce and eventually eliminate the operating expenses we incur to acquire and maintain a print textbook library. As we transition to a fully digital company, we will continue to buy used books on Ingram's behalf including books through our buyback program and invoice Ingram at cost. We will also continue to provide Ingram with extended payment terms in 2016 as we procure print textbooks on behalf of Ingram, before moving to normal payment terms in 2017.\nSeasonality of Our Business\nA substantial majority of our revenues are recognized ratably over the term the student rents our print textbooks and eTextbooks or has access to our Chegg Services. Historically, this has generally resulted in our highest revenues in the fourth quarter as it reflects more days of the academic year and our lowest revenues in the second quarter as colleges conclude their academic year for summer and there are fewer days of rentals. The recognition of revenues from our eTextbooks and Chegg Services will continue to follow this trend. As a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram, revenues from Ingram owned print textbook rental transactions will now be higher in the first and third quarters as we recognize a commission on the transaction rather than recognizing the revenues ratably over the term the student rents our textbooks. The variable expenses associated with our shipments of textbooks and marketing activities are highest in the first and third quarters as shipping and other fulfillment costs and marketing expenses are expensed when incurred, generally at the beginning of academic terms. We expect these variable expenses to decrease for 2016 as we have completely transitioned the shipping and fulfillment activities related to textbooks to Ingram. As a result of these factors, the most concentrated periods for our revenues and expenses do not necessarily coincide and comparisons of our quarterly operating results on a sequential basis may not provide meaningful insight into our overall financial performance. We expect our strategic partnership with Ingram to shift peak revenues in the periods that a student rents a textbook as a result of our revenue sharing agreement such that our revenues will more closely track the academic calendar as our expenses associated with the textbook rental business decrease.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nNet Revenues\nWe derive our revenues from the rental or sale of print textbooks and eTextbooks, and from commissions earned from Ingram from the rental of their textbooks and from Chegg Services, net of allowances for refunds or charge backs from our payment processors, who process payments from credit cards, debit cards and PayPal.\nWe generate revenues from the rental of print textbooks and to a lesser extent, through the sales of print textbooks through our website on a just-in-time basis. Rental revenues for textbooks that we own is recognized ratably over the term of the rental period, generally two to five months. Commissions earned on rental textbooks owned by Ingram are recognized immediately when a student places an order. Revenues from selling textbooks on a just-in-time basis is recognized upon shipment and has comprised approximately 10% of our consolidated revenues on average over the three years ended December 31, 2015. Our customers pay for the rental and sale of print textbooks on our website primarily by credit card, resulting in immediate settlement of our accounts receivable. Net revenues from the rental or sale of print textbooks represented 54%, 70% and 79% of our net revenues in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, reflecting increasing growth in our Chegg Services. Similar to the revenue recognition from print textbooks rentals, revenues from eTextbooks is recognized ratably over the contractual period, generally two to five months or at time of the sale, and our customers pay for these services through payment processors, resulting in immediate settlement of our accounts receivable.\nAs a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram, we recognize less revenues from the rental of print textbooks and our Required Materials, and services revenues includes a commission on the total revenues that we earn from Ingram upon their fulfillment of a rental transaction using books for which Ingram has title and risk of loss.\nWe also generate revenues from Chegg Services that include our Chegg Study service, which we offer to students, online tutoring, College Admissions, Scholarship Services, and Internship Services. We also offer enrollment marketing services to colleges and advertising services that we offer to brands. Chegg Services are offered to students through weekly, monthly or annual subscriptions, and we recognize revenues ratably over the respective subscription period. We primarily offer subscriptions to our Chegg Study service and tutoring services.\nWhen deciding the most appropriate basis for presenting revenues or costs of revenues, both the legal form and substance of the agreement between us and our business partners are reviewed to determine each party's respective role in the transaction. Where our role in a transaction is that of principal, revenues are recognized on a gross basis. This requires revenue to comprise the gross value of the transaction billed to the customer, after trade discounts, with any related expenditure charged as an operating cost. Where our role in a transaction is that of an agent, revenues are recognized on a net basis with revenues representing the margin earned. In relation to our partnership with Ingram and the rental of their textbooks, we recognize revenues on a net basis based on our role in the transaction as an agent.\nMarketing services include enrollment marketing services and brand advertising, which we offer either on a subscription or on an a la carte basis. Enrollment marketing services connect colleges with students seeking admission or scholarship opportunities at these institutions. Brand advertising offers brands unique ways to connect with students. Revenues are recognized ratably or as earned over the subscription service period, generally one year. Revenues from enrollment marketing services or brand advertising delivered on an a la carte basis, without a subscription, are recognized when delivery of the respective lead or service has occurred. For these services, we bill the customer at the inception, over the term of the customer arrangement or as the services are performed. Upon satisfactory assessment of creditworthiness, we generally grant credit to our enrollment marketing services and brand advertising customers with normal credit terms, typically 30 days.\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of advance payments from students related to rentals and subscriptions that have not been recognized and marketing services that have yet to be performed. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenues ratably over the term or when the services are provided and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nCost of Revenues\nOur cost of revenues consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products and services. Cost of revenues include textbook depreciation expense, shipping and other fulfillment costs, the cost of textbooks sold, payment processing costs, write-offs and allowances related to the print textbook library and all expenses associated with our distribution and customer service centers, including personnel and warehousing costs. The cost of textbooks sold, shipping and other fulfillment costs and payment processing expenses are recognized upon shipment, while textbook depreciation is recognized under an accelerated method over the life of the textbook. We believe this method most accurately reflects the actual pattern of decline in the economic value of the assets, resulting in higher costs earlier in the textbook lifecycle. Changes in our cost of revenues may be disproportionate to changes in our revenues because unrecoverable costs, such as outbound shipping and other fulfillment and payment processing fees, are expensed in the period they are incurred while revenues are recognized ratably over the rental term. This effect is particularly pronounced in the first and third quarters, corresponding to the beginning of academic terms. As a result, we could experience quarters in which our cost of revenues exceeds our revenues for the period. In addition, cost of revenues includes the depreciation of our eTextbook Reader software, publisher content fees for eTextbooks and allocated information technology and facilities costs.\nCost of revenues also consists of content amortization expense related to content that we develop or license, including publisher agreements for which we pay one-time license fees for published content, enrollment marketing services leads purchased from third-party suppliers to fulfill leads that we are unable to fulfill through our internal database, personnel costs and other direct costs related to providing content or services. In addition, cost of revenues include allocated information technology and facilities costs.\nWe anticipate that to the extent Chegg Services revenues grow and Ingram fulfills print textbook rental and sale orders, our gross margins will generally improve over time.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses into five categories: technology and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative, restructuring charges and gain on liquidation of textbooks. One of the most significant components of our operating expenses is employee-related costs, which include share-based compensation expenses. We expect to continue to hire new employees in order to support our current and anticipated growth. In any particular period, the timing of additional hires could materially affect our operating expenses, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues. Our costs and expenses\ncontain information technology expenses and facilities expenses such as webhosting, depreciation on our infrastructure systems, our headquarters lease expense and the employee-related costs for information technology support staff. We allocate these costs to each expense category, including cost of revenues, technology and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative. The allocation is primarily based on the headcount in each group at the end of a period. As our business grows, our operating expenses may increase over time to expand capacity and sustain our workforce.\nTechnology and Development\nOur technology and development expenses consist of salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expense for employees in our product and web design, engineering and technical teams who are responsible for maintaining our website, developing new products and improving existing products. Technology and development costs also include amortization of acquired intangible assets, webhosting costs, third-party development costs and allocated information technology and facilities expenses. We expense substantially all of our technology and development expenses as they are incurred. In the past three years, our expenses have increased to support new products and services as well as to expand our infrastructure capabilities to support back-end processes associated with our revenue transactions and internal systems used to manage our print textbook library. We intend to continue making significant investments in developing new products and services and enhancing the functionality of existing products and services.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist of user and advertiser-facing marketing and promotional expenditures through a number of targeted online marketing channels, sponsored search, display advertising, email marketing campaigns and other initiatives. We incur salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expenses for our employees engaged in marketing, business development and sales and sales support functions required for enrollment marketing services and amortization of acquired intangible assets and allocated information technology and facilities costs. Our marketing expenses are largely variable; and we tend to incur these in the first and third quarters of the year due to our efforts to target students at the beginning of academic terms. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense. Sales and marketing expenses also include lead generation services and sales commissions for our enrollment marketing services and brand advertising.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expense for certain executives as well as our finance, legal, human resources and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include outside consulting, legal and accounting services, provision for doubtful accounts and allocated information technology and facilities costs. We expect to incur additional costs when we transition from an emerging growth company\u201d including increased audit, legal, regulatory and other related fees.\nRestructuring Charges\nRestructuring charges are primarily comprised of severance costs, contract and program termination costs, asset impairments and costs of facility consolidation and closure. Restructuring charges are recorded upon approval of a formal management plan and are included in the operating results of the period in which such plan is approved and the expense becomes estimable.\nGain on Liquidation of Textbooks\nGain on liquidation of textbooks consists of proceeds we receive from the sale of previously rented print textbooks, through our website or to wholesalers and other channels, offset by the net book value of such textbooks. Our gain on liquidation of textbooks is driven by several factors including age of the books liquidated, the volume of books liquidated at a given point in time and the channel through which we liquidate. When the proceeds received exceed the net book value of the textbooks liquidated, we record a gain on liquidation of textbooks.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net consists primarily of interest expense on our debt obligations, changes in the fair value of our preferred stock warrants and interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Due to the uncertainty as to the realization of the benefits of our domestic deferred tax assets, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against such assets. We intend to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our historical consolidated statements of operations (in thousands, except percentage of revenues):\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues in the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $3.5 million, or 1%, compared to the same period in 2014. Rental revenues decreased $61.2 million or 34%, while services revenues increased $44.5 million, or 51%, and sales revenues increased $13.2 million, or 37%.\nNet revenues in the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $49.3 million, or 19%, compared to the same period in 2013. Rental revenues decreased $7.4 million or 4%, while services revenues increased $35.5 million, or 68%, and sales revenues increased $21.2 million, or 145%.\nThe decrease in rental revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was due to our strategic partnership with Ingram, which commenced in July 2014. As a result of our strategic partnership, our rental revenues are increasingly classified as services revenues to represent the commission on the total revenues that we earn from Ingram upon their fulfillment of a rental transaction using books for which Ingram has title and risk of loss rather than recognizing rental revenues from transactions using our print textbooks. The increase in services and sales revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was driven primarily from growth across our other offerings for students which included increased revenues from Chegg Study, eTextbooks, and our various acquisitions in 2014 as well as an increase in the commissions earned from Ingram.\nThe following table sets forth our net revenues for the periods shown for our Required Materials and Chegg Services product lines (dollars in thousands):\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. See the Note about Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for additional information. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nChegg is the leading student-first connected learning platform. Our goal is to help students transition from high school to college to career, with a view to improving student outcomes. We help students study more effectively for college admission exams, find the right college to accomplish their goals, get better grades and test scores while in school and find internships that allow them to gain valuable skills to help them enter the workforce after college. We strive to improve the overall return on investment in education.\nWe match domestic and international students with colleges, universities and other academic institutions (collectively referred to as colleges) in the United States. Students get help finding the best fit school for them and colleges are able to reach the best candidates at a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing. Once in college, we provide a range of products and services to help students save time, save money and get smarter. We offer an extensive print textbook library for rent and sale both on our own and through our strategic partnership with Ingram, which we discuss in more detail below. We also offer eTextbooks for rent and sale. Students can subscribe to our digital services, such as Chegg Study, which provides step-by-step Textbook Solutions and Expert Answers, helping students with their course work. We also have live tutors available to students online, anytime, anywhere through our Chegg Tutors service. Finally, we provide access to internships to help students gain skills that are critical to securing their first job.\nTo deliver services to students, we partner with a variety of third parties. We work with colleges to help shape their incoming classes. We source print textbooks, eTextbooks and supplemental materials directly or indirectly from thousands of publishers in the United States, including Pearson, Cengage Learning, McGraw Hill, Wiley and MacMillan. We have a large network of students and professionals who leverage our platform to tutor in their spare time and employers who leverage our platform to post their internships and jobs. In addition, because we have a large student user base, local and national brands partner with us to reach the college and high school demographic.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we generated net revenues of $301.4 million, $304.8 million and $255.6 million, respectively, and in the same periods had net losses of $59.2 million, $64.8 million and $55.9 million, respectively. We plan to continue to invest in our long-term growth, particularly further investment in the technology that powers our connected learning platform, the development of additional products and services that serve students, and expanding our strategic partnership with Ingram.\nOur strategy for achieving and maintaining profitability is centered upon our ability to utilize Chegg Services to increase student engagement with our connected learning platform. We plan to continue to invest in the expansion of Chegg Services to provide a more compelling and personalized solution and deepen engagement with students. We believe this expanded and deeper penetration of the student demographic will allow us to drive further growth in our enrollment and brand marketing services. In addition, we believe that the investments we have made to achieve our current scale will allow us to drive increased operating margins over time that, together with increased contributions of Chegg Services products, will enable us to accomplish profitability and become cash-flow positive for the long-term. Our ability to accomplish these long-term objectives is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including our ability to attract, retain and increasingly engage the student population, intense competition in our markets, the ability to achieve sufficient contributions to revenue from Chegg Services and other factors described in greater detail in Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nWe have presented revenues for our two product lines, Required Materials and Chegg Services, based on how students view us and the utilization of our products by them. Required Materials includes all products that are essential for students to meet the requirements of their coursework and Chegg Services includes all other products we provide to supplement the requirements and help students with their coursework. Chegg Services also includes our marketing services which help to complete our offering of services to students. More detail on our two product lines is discussed in the next two sections titled \"Required Materials\" and \"Chegg Services.\"\nRequired Materials\nOur Required Materials product line includes the rental and sale of print textbooks and eTextbooks as well as the commission we receive from Ingram. Our web-based, multiplatform eTextbook Reader, eTextbooks and supplemental course materials are available from approximately 120 publishers as of December 31, 2015, which we offer as a rental-equivalent solution and for free to students awaiting the arrival of their print textbook rental. This product line has been highly capital intensive due to the resources required to maintain a print textbook rental library. As a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram, we have exited our warehouse facilities in Kentucky and have transitioned our textbook library to Ingram's facilities helping to free up resources historically required by this product line. We will continue to liquidate our print textbook library through the normal course of our operations and expect it to be fully liquidated at the end of 2016. Until that point, we will continue to rent textbooks and recognize revenues on the textbooks that we own as rental revenues on our consolidated statement of operations through the liquidation period. Once our entire print textbook library has been liquidated, all revenues from print textbook rentals will be commission-based.\nWe have historically capitalized the investment in our print textbook library and record depreciation expense in cost of revenues over its useful life using an estimated liquidation value. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our investment in print textbooks, net of proceeds from textbook liquidation, was an inflow of $6.0 million and an outflow during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 of $54.7 million and $84.3 million, respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2015, investment in our print textbooks, net of proceeds from textbook liquidations, decreased to the point where we received more in proceeds from print textbook liquidations than we invested in new additions to our print textbook library. This is expected to continue through 2016 as we are no longer purchasing textbooks for rental as a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram.\nWe use our website to liquidate print textbooks from our print textbook library, which allows us to generate greater recovery on our print textbooks compared to bulk liquidations, while at the same time providing students substantial savings over the retail price of a new book. We are able to adjust what we liquidate based on expected rental demand. We also use our website to source, on behalf of Ingram, both new and used print textbooks for rental or resale from wholesalers, publishers and students. Purchasing used print textbooks allows us to reduce the investments necessary to maintain the rental catalog while at the same time attracting students to our website by offering more for their textbooks than they could generally get by selling them back to their campus bookstore.\nIn the aggregate, Required Materials revenues were 69%, 78%, and 84% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nChegg Services\nOur Chegg Services are experiencing rapid growth and we expect our partnership with Ingram to accelerate the growth of these offerings by freeing up capital while allowing us to maintain our leadership and brand recognition. Our Chegg Services for students include our connected learning platform, or the Student Hub, our test preparation service currently covering the ACT and SAT exams, online tutoring, our Chegg Study service, College Admissions, Scholarship Services and Internship Services. In addition, we offer enrollment marketing services to colleges, allowing them to reach interested college-bound high school students that use our College Admissions, and Scholarship Services. We also work with leading brands, such as Dell, MasterCard, Microsoft, PayPal, Proctor & Gamble, Red Bull, Shutterfly and Starbucks, to provide students with discounts, promotions and other products that, based on student feedback, delight them. For example, for Red Bull, we inserted a free can of Red Bull in select textbook rental shipments to students and Microsoft sponsored a Free Study Week,\u201d which included free access to our Chegg Study service as well as additional free study materials. All of our brand advertising services and the discounts, promotions and other products provided to students are paid for by the brands.\nStudents typically pay to access Chegg Services such as Chegg Study on a monthly or annual basis, while colleges subscribe to our enrollment marketing services and brands pay us depending on the nature of the campaign. In the aggregate, Chegg Services revenues were 31%, 22% and 16% of net revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nStrategic Partnership with Ingram\nWe expect our partnership with Ingram to accelerate the growth of Chegg Services products by allowing us to utilize capital otherwise spent on the purchase of print textbooks, and at the same time allowing us to maintain our leading position and high brand recognition through our iconic orange boxes. We entered into a definitive inventory purchase and consignment agreement with Ingram that will allow us to focus exclusively on eTextbooks and Chegg Services. Under the agreement, since May 1, 2015, Ingram has been responsible for all new investments in the print textbook library, fulfillment logistics, and has title and risk of loss related to print textbook rentals. As a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram, our revenues include a commission on the total revenues that we earn from Ingram upon their fulfillment of a rental transaction using print textbooks for which Ingram has title and risk of loss. Additionally, we have ceased making additional investments in our print textbook library during 2015 and expect to rent and liquidate our existing inventory of print textbooks during 2016. This new model will allow us to reduce and eventually eliminate the operating expenses we incur to acquire and maintain a print textbook library. As we transition to a fully digital company, we will continue to buy used books on Ingram's behalf including books through our buyback program and invoice Ingram at cost. We will also continue to provide Ingram with extended payment terms in 2016 as we procure print textbooks on behalf of Ingram, before moving to normal payment terms in 2017.\nSeasonality of Our Business\nA substantial majority of our revenues are recognized ratably over the term the student rents our print textbooks and eTextbooks or has access to our Chegg Services. Historically, this has generally resulted in our highest revenues in the fourth quarter as it reflects more days of the academic year and our lowest revenues in the second quarter as colleges conclude their academic year for summer and there are fewer days of rentals. The recognition of revenues from our eTextbooks and Chegg Services will continue to follow this trend. As a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram, revenues from Ingram owned print textbook rental transactions will now be higher in the first and third quarters as we recognize a commission on the transaction rather than recognizing the revenues ratably over the term the student rents our textbooks. The variable expenses associated with our shipments of textbooks and marketing activities are highest in the first and third quarters as shipping and other fulfillment costs and marketing expenses are expensed when incurred, generally at the beginning of academic terms. We expect these variable expenses to decrease for 2016 as we have completely transitioned the shipping and fulfillment activities related to textbooks to Ingram. As a result of these factors, the most concentrated periods for our revenues and expenses do not necessarily coincide and comparisons of our quarterly operating results on a sequential basis may not provide meaningful insight into our overall financial performance. We expect our strategic partnership with Ingram to shift peak revenues in the periods that a student rents a textbook as a result of our revenue sharing agreement such that our revenues will more closely track the academic calendar as our expenses associated with the textbook rental business decrease.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nNet Revenues\nWe derive our revenues from the rental or sale of print textbooks and eTextbooks, and from commissions earned from Ingram from the rental of their textbooks and from Chegg Services, net of allowances for refunds or charge backs from our payment processors, who process payments from credit cards, debit cards and PayPal.\nWe generate revenues from the rental of print textbooks and to a lesser extent, through the sales of print textbooks through our website on a just-in-time basis. Rental revenues for textbooks that we own is recognized ratably over the term of the rental period, generally two to five months. Commissions earned on rental textbooks owned by Ingram are recognized immediately when a student places an order. Revenues from selling textbooks on a just-in-time basis is recognized upon shipment and has comprised approximately 10% of our consolidated revenues on average over the three years ended December 31, 2015. Our customers pay for the rental and sale of print textbooks on our website primarily by credit card, resulting in immediate settlement of our accounts receivable. Net revenues from the rental or sale of print textbooks represented 54%, 70% and 79% of our net revenues in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, reflecting increasing growth in our Chegg Services. Similar to the revenue recognition from print textbooks rentals, revenues from eTextbooks is recognized ratably over the contractual period, generally two to five months or at time of the sale, and our customers pay for these services through payment processors, resulting in immediate settlement of our accounts receivable.\nAs a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram, we recognize less revenues from the rental of print textbooks and our Required Materials, and services revenues includes a commission on the total revenues that we earn from Ingram upon their fulfillment of a rental transaction using books for which Ingram has title and risk of loss.\nWe also generate revenues from Chegg Services that include our Chegg Study service, which we offer to students, online tutoring, College Admissions, Scholarship Services, and Internship Services. We also offer enrollment marketing services to colleges and advertising services that we offer to brands. Chegg Services are offered to students through weekly, monthly or annual subscriptions, and we recognize revenues ratably over the respective subscription period. We primarily offer subscriptions to our Chegg Study service and tutoring services.\nWhen deciding the most appropriate basis for presenting revenues or costs of revenues, both the legal form and substance of the agreement between us and our business partners are reviewed to determine each party's respective role in the transaction. Where our role in a transaction is that of principal, revenues are recognized on a gross basis. This requires revenue to comprise the gross value of the transaction billed to the customer, after trade discounts, with any related expenditure charged as an operating cost. Where our role in a transaction is that of an agent, revenues are recognized on a net basis with revenues representing the margin earned. In relation to our partnership with Ingram and the rental of their textbooks, we recognize revenues on a net basis based on our role in the transaction as an agent.\nMarketing services include enrollment marketing services and brand advertising, which we offer either on a subscription or on an a la carte basis. Enrollment marketing services connect colleges with students seeking admission or scholarship opportunities at these institutions. Brand advertising offers brands unique ways to connect with students. Revenues are recognized ratably or as earned over the subscription service period, generally one year. Revenues from enrollment marketing services or brand advertising delivered on an a la carte basis, without a subscription, are recognized when delivery of the respective lead or service has occurred. For these services, we bill the customer at the inception, over the term of the customer arrangement or as the services are performed. Upon satisfactory assessment of creditworthiness, we generally grant credit to our enrollment marketing services and brand advertising customers with normal credit terms, typically 30 days.\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of advance payments from students related to rentals and subscriptions that have not been recognized and marketing services that have yet to be performed. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenues ratably over the term or when the services are provided and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nCost of Revenues\nOur cost of revenues consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products and services. Cost of revenues include textbook depreciation expense, shipping and other fulfillment costs, the cost of textbooks sold, payment processing costs, write-offs and allowances related to the print textbook library and all expenses associated with our distribution and customer service centers, including personnel and warehousing costs. The cost of textbooks sold, shipping and other fulfillment costs and payment processing expenses are recognized upon shipment, while textbook depreciation is recognized under an accelerated method over the life of the textbook. We believe this method most accurately reflects the actual pattern of decline in the economic value of the assets, resulting in higher costs earlier in the textbook lifecycle. Changes in our cost of revenues may be disproportionate to changes in our revenues because unrecoverable costs, such as outbound shipping and other fulfillment and payment processing fees, are expensed in the period they are incurred while revenues are recognized ratably over the rental term. This effect is particularly pronounced in the first and third quarters, corresponding to the beginning of academic terms. As a result, we could experience quarters in which our cost of revenues exceeds our revenues for the period. In addition, cost of revenues includes the depreciation of our eTextbook Reader software, publisher content fees for eTextbooks and allocated information technology and facilities costs.\nCost of revenues also consists of content amortization expense related to content that we develop or license, including publisher agreements for which we pay one-time license fees for published content, enrollment marketing services leads purchased from third-party suppliers to fulfill leads that we are unable to fulfill through our internal database, personnel costs and other direct costs related to providing content or services.

We intend to continue making significant investments in developing new products and services and enhancing the functionality of existing products and services.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist of user and advertiser-facing marketing and promotional expenditures through a number of targeted online marketing channels, sponsored search, display advertising, email marketing campaigns and other initiatives. We incur salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expenses for our employees engaged in marketing, business development and sales and sales support functions required for enrollment marketing services and amortization of acquired intangible assets and allocated information technology and facilities costs.

Restructuring charges are recorded upon approval of a formal management plan and are included in the operating results of the period in which such plan is approved and the expense becomes estimable.\nGain on Liquidation of Textbooks\nGain on liquidation of textbooks consists of proceeds we receive from the sale of previously rented print textbooks, through our website or to wholesalers and other channels, offset by the net book value of such textbooks. Our gain on liquidation of textbooks is driven by several factors including age of the books liquidated, the volume of books liquidated at a given point in time and the channel through which we liquidate.

Due to the uncertainty as to the realization of the benefits of our domestic deferred tax assets, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against such assets. We intend to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our historical consolidated statements of operations (in thousands, except percentage of revenues):\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td>

year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $3.5 million, or 1%, compared to the same period in 2014. Rental revenues decreased $61.2 million or 34%, while services revenues increased $44.5 million, or 51%, and sales revenues increased $13.2 million, or 37%.\nNet revenues in the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $49.3 million, or 19%, compared to the same period in 2013. Rental revenues decreased $7.4 million or 4%, while services revenues increased $35.5 million, or 68%, and sales revenues increased $21.2 million, or 145%.\nThe decrease in rental revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was due to our strategic partnership with Ingram, which commenced in July 2014. As a result of our strategic partnership, our rental revenues are increasingly classified as services revenues to represent the commission on the total revenues that we earn from Ingram upon their fulfillment of a rental transaction using books for which Ingram has title and risk of loss rather than recognizing rental revenues from transactions using our print textbooks. The increase in services and sales revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was driven primarily from growth across our other offerings for students which included increased revenues from Chegg Study, eTextbooks, and our various acquisitions in 2014 as well as an increase in the commissions earned from Ingram.\nThe following table sets forth our net revenues for the periods shown for our Required Materials and Chegg Services product lines (dollars in thousands):\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td>"}
