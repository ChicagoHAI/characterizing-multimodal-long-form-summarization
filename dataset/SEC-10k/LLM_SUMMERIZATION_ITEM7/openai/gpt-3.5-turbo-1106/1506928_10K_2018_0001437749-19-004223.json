MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage medical device company that designs, manufactures and sells image-guided, catheter-based systems that are used by physicians to treat patients with peripheral artery disease, or PAD. Patients with PAD have a build-up of plaque in the arteries that supply blood to areas away from the heart, particularly the pelvis and legs. Our mission is to significantly improve the treatment of vascular disease through the introduction of products based on our Lumivascular platform, the only intravascular image-guided system available in this market. We manufacture and sell a suite of products in the United States and select international markets. Our current products include our Lightbox imaging console, the Ocelot family of catheters, which are designed to allow physicians to penetrate a total blockage in an artery, known as a chronic total occlusion, or CTO, and Pantheris, our image-guided atherectomy device which is designed to allow physicians to precisely remove arterial plaque in PAD patients. We received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for commercialization of Pantheris in October 2015. We received an additional 510(k) clearance for an enhanced version of Pantheris in March 2016 and commenced sales of Pantheris in the United States and select European countries promptly thereafter. In May 2018, the Company also received 510(K) clearance from the FDA for its current next-generation version of Pantheris. The Company has sales in the U.S. and select international markets. The Company is located in Redwood City, California. The Company submitted a 510(k) filing in respect of Pantheris SV (Small Vessel), a lower profile Pantheris, in August 2018 and received CE Marking for Pantheris SV in October 2018.We also offer the Wildcat and Kittycat 2 catheters, which are used for crossing CTOs but do not contain on-board imaging technology.\nWe are developing a next-generation version of our Pantheris atherectomy device, Pantheris SV, a lower profile Pantheris. The lower profile Pantheris has a smaller diameter and longer length that we believe will optimize it for use in smaller vessels. We submitted a 510(k) application for Pantheris SV in smaller vessels in August 2018 and received CE Marking approval in October 2018. In addition, we completed development of our next-generation Pantheris which we believe represents a significant improvement over our prior product. Our next-generation Pantheris includes new features and design improvements to the handle, shaft, balloon and nose cone that we believe improves usability and reliability. Our next-generation Pantheris received CE Marking approval in December 2017 and was cleared by the FDA in May 2018. The next-generation Pantheris is available for commercial sale in the EU and United States.\nDuring the first quarter of 2015, we completed enrollment of patients in VISION, a clinical trial designed to support our August 2015 510(k) filing with the FDA for our Pantheris atherectomy device. VISION was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pantheris to perform atherectomy using intravascular imaging and successfully achieved all primary and secondary safety and efficacy endpoints. We believe the data from VISION allows us to demonstrate that avoiding damage to healthy arterial structures, and in particular disruption of the external elastic lamina, which is the membrane between the outermost layers of the artery, reduces the likelihood of restenosis, or re-narrowing, of the diseased artery. Although the original VISION study protocol was not designed to follow patients beyond six months, we have worked with 18 of the VISION sites to re-solicit consent from previous clinical trial patients in order for them to evaluate patient outcomes through 12 and 24 months following initial treatment. Data collection for the remaining patients from participating sites was completed in May 2017, and we released the final 12- and 24-month results for a total of 89 patients in July 2017. We commenced commercialization of Pantheris as part of our Lumivascular platform in the United States and in select international markets in March 2016, after obtaining the required marketing authorizations. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we began enrolling patients in INSIGHT, a clinical trial designed to support a filing with the FDA to expand the indication for our Pantheris atherectomy device to include in-stent restenosis. Patient enrollment began in October 2017 and is expected to continue through early 2019. Patient outcomes will be evaluated at thirty days, six months and one year following treatment. We plan to submit a 510(k) application with the FDA seeking a specific indication for treating in-stent restenosis with Pantheris once the trial is fully enrolled and follow-up data through six months are available and analyzed.\nWe focus our direct sales force, marketing efforts and promotional activities on interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists. We also work on developing strong relationships with physicians and hospitals that we have identified as key opinion leaders. Although our sales and marketing efforts are directed at these physicians because they are the primary users of our technology, we consider the hospitals and medical centers where the procedure is performed to be our customers, as they typically are responsible for purchasing our products. We are designing future products to be compatible with our Lumivascular platform, which we expect to enhance the value proposition for hospitals to invest in our technology. Pantheris qualifies for existing reimbursement codes currently utilized by other atherectomy products, further facilitating adoption of our products.\nPrior to the introduction of our Lumivascular platform our non-imaging catheter products were manufactured by third parties. All of our products are now manufactured in-house at our facilities in Redwood City, California using components and sub-assemblies manufactured both in-house and by outside vendors. We assemble all of our products at our manufacturing facility, but certain critical processes such as coating and sterilization are done by outside vendors. We expect our current manufacturing facility will be sufficient through at least 2019.\nIn addition to commercialization of Pantheris in the United States and select international markets in March 2016, we began commercializing our initial non-Lumivascular platform products in 2009 and introduced our Lumivascular platform products in the United States in late 2012. We generated revenues of $7.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 and $9.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our net loss and comprehensive loss was $27.6 million and $48.7 million, respectively. We have not been profitable since inception, and as of December 31, 2018, our accumulated deficit was $328.9 million. Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily through private and public placements of our preferred and common securities and, to a lesser extent, debt financing arrangements. In January 2015, we completed an initial public offering, or IPO, of 125,000 shares. As a result of our IPO, which closed in February 2015, we received net proceeds of approximately $56.9 million, after underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $4.5 million and other expenses associated with our IPO of approximately $3.6 million.\nIn September 2015, we entered into a Term Loan Agreement, or Loan Agreement, with CRG Partners III L.P. and certain of its affiliated funds, collectively CRG, under which we were able to borrow up to $50.0 million on or before March 29, 2017, subject to certain terms and conditions. We borrowed $30.0 million on September 22, 2015 and an additional $10.0 million on June 15, 2016 under the Loan Agreement. Contingent on achievement of certain revenue milestones, among other conditions, we would have been eligible to borrow an additional $10.0 million, on or prior to March 29, 2017; however, we did not achieve the level of revenues required to borrow the final $10.0 million. Contemporaneously with the execution of the Loan Agreement, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with CRG, pursuant to which CRG purchased 8,705 shares of our common stock on September 22, 2015 at a price of $559.64 per share, which represents the 10-day average of closing prices of our common stock ending on September 21, 2015. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, we filed a registration statement covering the resale of the shares sold to CRG and must comply with certain affirmative covenants during the time that such registration statement remains in effect. We used the proceeds from the CRG borrowing and securities purchase to retire our outstanding principal and accrued interest with PDL Biopharma, or PDL, and to retire the principal and accrued interest underlying our outstanding promissory notes, or the notes.\nOn February 3, 2016, we filed a universal shelf registration statement to offer up to $150.0 million of our securities and entered into an at-the-market\u201d program pursuant to a Sales Agreement with Cowen and Company, or Cowen, through which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of common stock having an aggregate offering value of up to $50.0 million. The shelf registration statement also covers the resale of the shares sold to CRG. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on March 8, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold 27,374 shares of common stock through the at-the-market\u201d program at an average price of $194.74 and raised net proceeds of $5.2 million, after payment of $0.2 million in commissions and fees to Cowen. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold 189,684 shares of common stock through the at-the-market\u201d program at an average price of $17.68 and raised net proceeds of $3.2 million, after payment of $0.1 million in commissions and fees to Cowen. Due to the SEC's baby shelf rules,\u201d which prohibit companies with a public float of less than $75 million from issuing securities under a shelf registration statement in excess of one-third of such company's public float in a twelve-month period, at this time we are unable to issue more shares through our at-the-market\u201d program. In addition, in August 2016 we completed a follow-on public offering of 246,445 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $31.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $2.4 million and other expenses of approximately $0.6 million. The 246,445 shares include the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 32,145 shares of our common stock.\nIn April 2017, we undertook an organizational realignment which included a reduction in force, that lowered our total headcount by approximately 33% compared to December 31, 2016. The organizational realignment was designed to focus our commercial efforts on driving catheter utilization in our strongest markets, around our most productive sales professionals. Our field sales personnel headcount was reduced to 32, down from 60 as of December 31, 2016. This workforce reduction was designed to reduce operating expenses while continuing to support major product development and clinical initiatives. The strategic reduction in the field sales force was designed to maintain robust engagement with higher volume users of our Lumivascular technology and position us to increase utilization of our catheters within our installed base of accounts in 2018 following the launch of our next generation products. In September 2017, we effected a cost reduction plan, which also included a company-wide reduction in force, lowering our total headcount by an additional 24 employees. Our field sales personnel headcount was further reduced to a total of 20 people. In addition, as part of the cost reduction plan, in October 2017, we subleased a portion of the Company's facilities and consolidated our operations primarily into one building.\nOn November 3, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, or Lincoln Park, pursuant to which Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase, at our request, up to $15.0 million of our common stock over a 30-month period, subject to certain limitations set forth in the purchase agreement (the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement\u201d). As a fee for Lincoln Park's commitment to purchase such shares, we issued 23,584 shares of common stock to Lincoln Park on November 3, 2017. As obligated under a registration rights agreement entered into with Lincoln Park in connection with the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 on November 6, 2017 for up to 248,750 of such shares, which registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on November 17, 2017.\nOn February 14, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Term Loan Agreement (the Amendment No. 2 Loan Agreement\u201d) with CRG. Under its terms, the Amendment No. 2 Loan Agreement, among other things: (1) extended the interest-only period through June 30, 2021; (2) extended the period during which the Company may elect to pay a portion of interest in payment-in-kind, or PIK, interest payments through June 30, 2021 so long as no default has occurred and is continuing; (3) permitted the Company to make its entire interest payments in PIK interest payments for through December 31, 2019 so long as no default has occurred and is continuing; (4) extended the maturity date to June 30, 2023; (5) reduced the minimum liquidity requirement to $3.5 million at all times; (6) eliminated the minimum revenue covenant for 2018 and 2019; (7) reduced the minimum revenue covenant to $15 million for 2020, $20 million for 2021 and $25 million for 2022; and (8) provided CRG with board observer rights.\nIn addition, on February 14, 2018, we entered into a Series A preferred stock Purchase Agreement (the Series A Purchase Agreement\u201d) with CRG, pursuant to which it agreed to convert $38.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of its senior secured term loan (plus the back-end fee and prepayment premium applicable thereto) under the Loan Agreement into a newly authorized Series A preferred stock. As discussed in the section of this report titled Dividend Policy,\u201d the holders of Series A preferred stock are entitled to receive annual accruing dividends at a rate of 8%, payable in additional shares of Series A preferred stock or cash, at our option. The shares of Series A preferred stock have no voting rights and rank senior to all other classes and series of the Company's equity in terms of repayment and certain other rights. The Series A preferred stock and any of the Company's common stock issued upon conversion of the Series A preferred stock is subject to a lockup agreement through February 14, 2019.\nOn February 16, 2018, we completed a public offering of 17,979 shares of Series B preferred stock and warrants to purchase 17,979,000 shares of common stock. As a result, we received net proceeds of approximately $15.5 million after underwriting discounts, commissions, legal and accounting fees. Each share of Series B preferred stock is accompanied by one warrant that expires on the seventh anniversary of the date of issuance to purchase up to 500 shares of common stock (the Series 1 warrants\u201d) and one warrant that expires on the earlier of (i) the seventh anniversary of the date of issuance or (ii) the 60th calendar day following the receipt and announcement of FDA clearance of our Pantheris below-the-knee device (or the same or similar product with a different name) to purchase up to 500 shares of common stock; provided, however, if at any time during such 60-day period the volume weighted average price for any trading day is less than the then effective exercise price, the termination date shall be extended to the seven year anniversary of the initial exercise date (the Series 2 warrants\u201d). In addition, pursuant to the Series A Purchase Agreement, we issued to CRG 41,800 shares of Series A preferred stock at the closing of the Series B Offering. The Series A preferred stock was issued in exchange for the conversion of $38.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of their senior secured term loan (plus the back-end fee and prepayment premium applicable thereto), totaling approximately $41.8 million. The Series A preferred stock is initially convertible into 20,900,000 shares of common stock subject to certain limitations contained in the Series A Purchase Agreement.\nOn July 12, 2018, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain investors pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue, in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 2,166,180 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $1.6425 per share. In a concurrent private placement, or the Private Placement, we agreed to issue to these investors warrants exercisable for one share of our common stock for each two shares purchased in the registered direct offering, which equals an aggregate of 1,083,091 shares of common stock. The closing of such registered direct offering and the concurrent Private Placement occurred on July 16, 2018, in connection with which we received net proceeds of approximately $3.0 million after deducting placement agent fees and other expenses payable by us and the conversion price of the outstanding shares of Series B preferred stock, issued in our February 2018 offering, was reduced to $1.58 per share as a result. The warrants have an exercise price of $1.58 per share of our common stock and may be exercised from time to time beginning on January 17, 2019 and expire on July 16, 2021.\nOn November 1, 2018, we completed a public offering of 7,285,000 shares of common stock and 8,586 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock (the Series C preferred stock\u201d). As a result, we received net proceeds of approximately $10.2 million after underwriting discounts, commissions, legal and accounting fees. Upon any dissolution, liquidation or winding up, whether voluntary or involuntary, holders of Series C preferred stock will be entitled to receive distributions out of our assets, whether capital or surplus, of an amount equal to $0.001 per share of Series C preferred stock before any distributions shall be made on the common stock but after distributions shall be made on any outstanding Series A preferred stock and any of our existing or future indebtedness. The Series C preferred stock has no voting rights.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nAll of our revenues are currently derived from sales of our Lightbox console, as well as related services, and sales of our various PAD catheters in the United States and select international markets. We expect our revenues to increase in 2019 as we introduce our Pantheris small vessel device and expand our sales force. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nRevenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including capital equipment purchasing patterns that are typically increased towards the end of the calendar year and decreased in the first quarter. In addition, during the first quarter, our results can be harmed by adverse weather and by resetting of annual patient healthcare insurance plan deductibles, both of which may cause patients to delay elective procedures. In the third quarter, the number of elective procedures nationwide is historically lower than other quarters throughout the year, which we believe is primarily attributable to the summer vacations of physicians and their patients.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin\nCost of revenues consists primarily of costs related to manufacturing overhead, materials and direct labor. We expense all warranty costs and inventory provisions as cost of revenues. We periodically write-down inventory for estimated excess, obsolete and non-sellable inventories based on assumptions about future demand, past usage, changes to manufacturing processes and overall market conditions. A significant portion of our cost of revenues currently consists of manufacturing overhead costs. These overhead costs include the cost of quality assurance, material procurement, inventory control, facilities, equipment and operations supervision and management. We expect overhead costs as a percentage of revenues to become less significant as our production volume increases. Cost of revenues also includes depreciation expense for production equipment, depreciation and related maintenance expense for placed Lightboxes held by customers and certain direct costs such as those incurred for shipping our products.\nWe calculate gross margin as gross profit divided by revenues. Our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, primarily production volumes, manufacturing costs, product yields, headcount, charges for excess and obsolete inventories and cost-reduction strategies. We expect our gross margin to increase over the long term as our production volume increases and as we spread the fixed portion of our manufacturing overhead costs over a larger number of units produced, thereby reducing our per unit manufacturing costs. We intend to use our design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities to further advance and improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes, which we believe will reduce costs and increase our gross margin. In the future, we may seek to manufacture certain of our products outside the United States to further reduce costs. Our gross margin will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter as we continue to introduce new products and sales channels, and as we adopt new manufacturing processes and technologies.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development, or R&D, expenses consist primarily of engineering, product development, clinical and regulatory affairs, consulting services, materials, depreciation and other costs associated with products and technologies in development. These expenses include employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, supplies, materials, quality assurance expenses allocated to R&D programs, consulting, related travel expenses and facilities expenses. Clinical expenses include clinical trial design, clinical site reimbursement, data management, travel expenses and the cost of manufacturing products for clinical trials. We expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues to vary over time depending on the level and timing of our new product development efforts, as well as our clinical development, clinical trial and other related activities.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses consist primarily of compensation for personnel, including stock-based compensation, related to selling and marketing functions, physician education programs, business development, finance, information technology and human resource functions. Other SG&A expenses include commissions, training, travel expenses, educational and promotional activities, marketing initiatives, market research and analysis, conferences and trade shows, professional services fees, including legal, audit and tax fees, insurance costs, general corporate expenses and allocated facilities-related expenses. We expect SG&A expenses to remain relatively flat compared to the prior year.\nInterest Income (Expense), net\nInterest income (expense), net consists primarily of interest incurred on our outstanding indebtedness and non-cash interest related to the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs associated with our various debt agreements.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign exchange transactions.\nResults of Operations:\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,915 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,934 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,531 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,002 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,068 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-31 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,319 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,120 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring charges\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,285 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Litigation settlement\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,760 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,484 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,067 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42,552 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income (expense), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,478 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,191 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss and comprehensive loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(27,558 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(48,732 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nRevenues. Revenues decreased $2.0 million, or 20.4%, to $7.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $9.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decreased revenues in 2018 reflect the impact of the reduced size of our field sales force.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin. Cost of revenues decreased $6.5 million, or 50%, to $6.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $13.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower excess and obsolescence charges predominantly related to our Lightbox and Pantheris inventories and our decreased sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 reflecting the impact of the reduced size of our sales force. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to 17% compared to -31% in the year ended December 31, 2017. Stock-based compensation expense within cost of revenues totaled $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nResearch and Development Expenses. R&D expenses decreased $5.3 million, or 47%, to $6.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $11.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related expenses as a result of fewer employees and lower project spending due to completion of projects previously in process. Stock-based compensation expense within R&D totaled $0.5 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses decreased $7.7 million, or 31%, to $17.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $25.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related expenses as a result of fewer employees and lower professional services expenses. Stock-based compensation expense within SG&A totaled $2.4 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nRestructuring. In April, September and October 2017, we undertook organizational realignment and cost reduction activities to conserve resources which included reductions in force that lowered our total headcount and the sublease of one of our facilities. We recorded $1.3 million in restructuring charges during the year ended December 31, 2017, which consisted of severance related costs specific to the termination of 44 and 24 employees in April and September 2017, respectively, and an operating lease related liability for one of our facilities.\nLitigation Settlement. Between May 22, 2017 and May 25, 2017, three class actions were filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Mateo, or the State Court, against us and certain of our officers and directors. The underwriters of our IPO in January 2015 were also named as defendants. These lawsuits allege that the registration statement for our IPO made false and misleading statements and omissions in violation of the Securities Act of 1933. Plaintiffs sought, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages, interest, costs, recission, and attorneys' fees.\nThe Company and its directors believe that the foregoing lawsuits were without merit; however, in the interest of avoiding the cost and disruption of continuing to defend against these lawsuits, the Company entered into a settlement of the actions. The settlement is for a total of $5 million. The Company's total contribution to the settlement fund was $1.76 million, which was expensed in 2017 and paid in March 2018. On October 24, 2018, the court approved the settlement.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net. Interest income (expense), net decreased $0.6 million, or 19%, to an expense of $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to an expense of $6.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The reason for the decrease is primarily due to CRG's conversion of $38.0 million in outstanding principal and interest into Series A preferred stock in connection with our February 2018 public offering. Additionally, amortization of the debt discount recorded in connection with the issuance of the debt was converted as a result of our offering.\nOther income (expense), net was not significant for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Other income was primarily attributable to the remeasurement of foreign exchange transactions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $16.4 million and an accumulated deficit of $328.9 million, compared to cash and cash equivalents of $5.4 million and an accumulated deficit of $301.3 million as of December 31, 2017. We do not know when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our ongoing operations. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any additional debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders and require significant debt service payments, which divert resources from other activities. Additional financing may not be available at all, or if available, may not be in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to delay the development, commercialization and marketing of our products and we may be required to significantly scale back our business and operations.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our products and net proceeds from the issuance of our preferred stock and debt financings, our at-the-market\u201d program, our initial public offering, or IPO, our follow-on public offerings and other post-IPO private offerings, primarily of warrants. The warrants issued pursuant to the Series B Purchase Agreement entered into in connection with the Series B preferred stock follow-on in February 2018, or the Series B Offering, prohibit us from entering into certain transactions involving the issuance of securities for a price determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock or otherwise subject to modification following the date of issuance, in each case for a period of three years from the closing date of the Series B Offering (and excluding purchases pursuant to the Series B Purchase Agreement, which may be made on the 120 day anniversary of the closing date of the offering). This prohibition may be waived by holders of two-thirds of the outstanding Series 1 and Series 2 warrants at any time.\nOn September 22, 2015, the Company entered into a Term Loan Agreement (the Loan Agreement\u201d), with CRG under which, subject to certain conditions, the Company had the right to borrow up to $50,000,000 in principal amount from CRG on or before March 29, 2017. The Company borrowed $30,000,000 on September 22, 2015. The Company borrowed an additional $10,000,000 on June 15, 2016 under the Loan Agreement.\nOn February 14, 2018, the Company and CRG amended the Loan Agreement concurrent with the conversion of $38,000,000 of the principal amount of the senior secured term loan (plus $3,800,000 in back-end fees and prepayment premium applicable thereto) into shares of a newly authorized Series A convertible preferred stock. To date, the Company has elected to make payment-in-kind for the majority of the 12.5% interest rate and plans to continue doing so until such time as cash payments are required. As of December 31, 2018, the balance due under the loan, including payment-in-kind, is $7.5 million. No cash payments will be made until the final two years of the loan, which matures in June 2023. On February 11, 2019, our board of directors declared a dividend on our Series A Preferred Stock, and we issued 2,945 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to pay the preferred dividend to the holder of Series A Preferred Stock.\nOn February 3, 2016, we filed a universal shelf registration statement to offer up to $150.0 million of our securities and entered into an at-the-market\u201d program pursuant to a Sales Agreement with Cowen, as sales agent, through which we issued and sold common stock with an aggregate value of approximately $8.7 million between the registration statement's effectiveness on March 8, 2016 and September 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold 27,374 shares of common stock through the at-the-market\u201d program at an average price of $194.74 and raised net proceeds of $5.2 million, after payment of $0.2 million in commissions and fees to Cowen. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold 189,684 shares of common stock through the at-the-market\u201d program at an average price of $17.68 and raised net proceeds of $3.2 million, after payment of $0.1 million in commissions and fees to Cowen. Due to the SEC's baby shelf rules,\u201d which prohibit companies with a public float of less than $75 million from issuing securities under a shelf registration statement in excess of one-third of such company's public float in a twelve-month period, we are unable to issue more shares through our at-the-market\u201d program at this time. In addition, in August 2016, we issued and sold 246,445 shares of our common stock in a follow-on public offering at a public offering price of $140.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $31.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $2.4 million and other expenses of approximately $0.6 million. The 246,445 shares include the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 32,145 shares of our common stock.\nOn February 16, 2018, we completed a public offering of 17,979 shares of Series B preferred stock and warrants to purchase 17,979,000 shares of common stock. As a result, we received net proceeds of approximately $15.5 million after underwriting discounts, commissions, legal and accounting fees. The Series B preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $0.001 per share, full ratchet price based anti-dilution protection, has no voting rights and is subject to certain ownership limitations. The Series B preferred stock is immediately convertible at the option of the holder, has no stated maturity, and does not pay regularly stated dividends or interest. Each share of Series B preferred stock is accompanied by one Series 1 warrant that expires on the seventh anniversary of the date of issuance to purchase up to 500 shares of common stock and one Series 2 warrant that expires on the earlier of (i) the seventh anniversary of the date of issuance or (ii) the 60th calendar day following the receipt and announcement of FDA clearance of our Pantheris below-the-knee device (or the same or similar product with a different name) to purchase up to 500 shares of common stock; provided, however, if at any time during such 60-day period the volume weighted average price for any trading day is less than the then effective exercise price, the termination date shall be extended to the seven year anniversary of the initial exercise date. In addition, pursuant to the Series A Purchase Agreement, we issued to CRG 41,800 shares of Series A preferred stock at the closing of the Series B Offering. The Series A preferred stock was issued in exchange for the conversion of $38.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of their senior secured term loan (plus the back-end fee and prepayment premium applicable thereto), totaling approximately $41.8 million. The Series A Preferred Stock is initially convertible into 20,900,000 shares of common stock subject to certain limitations contained in the Series A Purchase Agreement.\nOn July 12, 2018, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain investors pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue, in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 2,166,180 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $1.6425 per share. In a concurrent private placement, or the Private Placement, we agreed to issue to these investors warrants exercisable for one share of our common stock for each two shares purchased in the registered direct offering, which equals an aggregate of 1,083,091 shares of common stock. The closing of such registered direct offering and the concurrent Private Placement occurred on July 16, 2018, in connection with which we received net proceeds of approximately $3. million after deducting placement agent fees and other expenses payable by us and the conversion price of the outstanding shares of Series B preferred stock, issued in our February 2018 offering, was reduced to $1.58 per share as a result. The warrants have an exercise price of $1.58 per share of our common stock and may be exercised from time to time beginning on January 17, 2019 and expire on July 16, 2021.\nOn November 1, 2018, we completed a public offering of 7,285,000 shares of common stock and 8,586 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock (the Series C preferred stock\u201d). As a result, we received net proceeds of approximately $10.2 million after underwriting discounts, commissions, legal and accounting fees. Upon any dissolution, liquidation or winding up, whether voluntary or involuntary, holders of Series C preferred stock will be entitled to receive distributions out of our assets, whether capital or surplus, of an amount equal to $0.001 per share of Series C preferred stock before any distributions shall be made on the common stock but after distributions shall be made on any outstanding Series A preferred stock and any of our existing or future indebtedness. The Series C preferred stock has no voting rights.\nCash Flows\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18,466 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(34,476 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,810 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(30,707 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $18.5 million, consisting primarily of a net loss of $27.6 million and an increase in net operating assets of $2.2 million, offset by non-cash charges of $11.3 million. Non-cash charges were largely related to non-cash interest charges of $5.6 million, stock-based compensation of $3.1 million, depreciation and amortization of $1.3 million and provision for excess and obsolete inventories of $0.9 million. The increase in net operating assets was due to decreases in accrued expenses and other liabilities, and other long-term liabilities, offset by decreases in other assets and accrued compensation in inventories and accounts receivable, offset by an increase in other assets. The increase in operating liabilities was largely due to decreases in accrued compensation due to our workforce reductions, offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities related to the litigation settlement.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $34.5 million, consisting primarily of a net loss of $48.7 million and an increase in net operating assets of $2.8 million, offset by non-cash charges of $17.3 million. The increase in non-cash charges was due to an increase in interest expense and other charges, litigation settlement and provision for excess and obsolete inventories, offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation. The increase in net operating assets was due to an increase in inventories. The decreases in accounts payable, accrued compensation and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, were due to our workforce reductions in April and September, the sublease of one of our facilities and efforts to reduce operating expenses, and decreases in other liabilities related to the repayment of assigned interest to PDL, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of depreciation, stock-based compensation, non-cash interest expense and other charges related to our credit agreement with CRG, and an increased reserve for excess and obsolescence in inventories.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 was $4,000 consisting of purchases of property and equipment of $32,000, partially offset by proceeds of $28,000 from the sale of property and equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2017 was $41,000 consisting of purchases of property and equipment of $45,000, partially offset by proceeds of $4,000 from the sales of property and equipment.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 of $29.4 million primarily related to net proceeds of $29.2 million from the issuances of convertible preferred stock and common stock, net of various issuance costs, in addition to $0.6 million related to proceeds from warrant exercises.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2017 of $3.8 million primarily relates to net proceeds of $3.6 million from the issuance of common stock under the Sales Agreement with Cowen and Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement and $0.2 million proceeds from sales of our common stock.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements, such as structured finance, special purpose entities, or variable interest entities.\nContractual Obligations\nOur principal obligations consist of the operating lease for our facilities (net of sublease income), our Loan Agreement with CRG and non-cancellable purchase commitments. The following table sets out, as of December 31, 2018, our contractual obligations due by period (in thousands):\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less Than\n\t\t\t1 Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 - 3\n\t\t\tYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More\n\t\t\tThan 5\n\t\t\tYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations, net of sublease income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>899 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CRG Loan\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,502 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,704 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noncancellable purchase commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,490 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,877 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,502 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,480 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe total CRG Loan amount, shown as borrowings on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2018, is $7.5 million.

The Amended Lease has a rental commencement date of December 1, 2011, a term of eight years and expires in November 2019 The Amended Lease is for an aggregate of approximately 44,200 rentable square feet. We are currently in the process of negotiating a renewal of one of the buildings under the original lease.\nOn October 19, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to sublease one of its facilities. The sublease agreement is estimated to commence on approximately December 1, 2017 and is scheduled to expire on November 15, 2019 (which is 15 days prior to the expiration of the facility lease). Prior to December 1, 2018, he sublessee paid a base rent of $3.25 per rentable square foot, for a total of $79,950 per month. On December 1, 2018, the base rent increased to $3.35 per rentable square foot, for a total of $82,410 per month. In addition to the base rent, the sublessee pays the Landlord's operating expenses and property taxes due and payable with respect to the subleased facility.\nIn February 2016, we entered into an additional non-cancelable operating lease for 6,600 square feet of warehouse and storage space in Redwood City, California, The lease agreement originally was to expire in November 2019. We exited this warehouse lease in December 2018 and incurred exit costs of approximately $50,000 which is included in rent expense for 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions for the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nRevenue Recognition\nAll of our revenues are currently derived from sales of our Lumivascular platform products, sales of various non-imaging PAD catheters and related services in the United States and select international markets. We do not have bundled sales arrangements. We recognize revenues when the following revenue recognition criteria are met:\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. We consider this criterion satisfied when we have an agreement or contract in place with the customer.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. We principally determine this criterion to be satisfied as follows:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Lightbox console: upon our receipt of a form executed by the customer acknowledging that the training and installation process is complete.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> PAD catheters: when the product has been shipped and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Service: recognized ratably over the term of the service period. To date service revenues have been insignificant.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> The fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe determine the satisfaction of these criteria based on our judgment regarding the nature of the fee charged for products, contractual agreements entered into, and the collectability of those fees under any contract or agreement.\nWe offer our customers the ability to purchase or lease our Lightbox. In addition, we provide our Lightbox under a limited commercial evaluation program to allow certain strategic accounts to install and utilize the Lightbox for a limited trial period of three to six months. When a Lightbox is placed, we retain title to the equipment and it remains capitalized on our balance sheet under property and equipment. The costs to maintain these placed Lightboxes held by customers are charged to cost of revenues as incurred.\nFor sales through distributors, we recognize revenue when title to the product and the risk of loss transfers from us to the distributor. The distributors are responsible for all marketing, sales, training and warranty in their respective territories. The standard terms and conditions contained in our distribution agreements do not provide price protection or stock rotation rights to any of its distributors. In addition, its distributor agreements do not allow the distributor to return or exchange products, and the distributor is obligated to pay us upon invoice regardless of its ability to resell the product.\nWe must make significant assumptions regarding the future collectability of accounts receivable from customers to determine whether revenue recognition criteria have been met. If collectability is not assured at the time of shipment, we defer revenues until such criterion has been met. We estimate reductions in revenue for potential returns of products by customers. In making such estimates, we analyze historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products.\nInventories\nInventories, which includes material, labor and overhead costs, are stated at standard cost, which approximates actual cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, and not in excess of net realizable value. The cost basis of our inventory is reduced for any products that are considered excessive or obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could have a material impact on our gross profit and inventory balances.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe maintain an equity incentive plan to provide long-term incentive for employees, consultants and members of our board of directors. The plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options ( ISOs\u201d) to employees and for the grant of non-statutory stock options ( NSOs\u201d), restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares to employees, directors and consultants.\nAs noncash stock-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company estimated a forfeiture rate for its stock options and RSUs based on an analysis of its actual forfeitures and other factors. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, over the service period to the extent that actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from prior estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on estimated future employee turnover and historical experience. Effective January 1, 2017, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-09 and elected to recognize forfeitures when they occur using a modified retrospective approach. We use the straight-line method for expense attribution.\nThe valuation model we used for calculating the fair value of stock options for stock-based compensation expense is the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, or the Black-Scholes model. The Black-Scholes model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation, including the weighted average period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding, the volatility of common stock, an assumed risk-free interest rate and an estimated forfeiture rate.\nFair Value of Common Stock. Prior to completion of our IPO in January 2015, the fair value of the shares of our common stock underlying the stock options has historically been determined by our board of directors after considering independent third-party valuation reports. Because there had previously been no public market for our common stock, our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock at the time of grant of the option by considering a number of objective and subjective factors, including valuations of comparable companies, sales of our preferred stock, our operating and financial performance and the general and industry-specific economic outlook. Following our IPO in January 2015, the fair value of our common stock is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nExpected Term. We do not believe we are able to rely on our historical exercise and post-vesting termination activity to provide accurate data for estimating the expected term for use in determining the fair value-based measurement of our options. Therefore, we have opted to use the simplified method\u201d for estimating the expected term of options, which is the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option.\nExpected Volatility. Due to the Company's limited operating history and a lack of company specific historical and implied volatility data, the Company bases its estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. When selecting these public companies on which it has based its expected stock price volatility, the Company selected companies with comparable characteristics to it, including enterprise value, stage of development, risk profile, and position within the industry as well as selecting companies with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. The historical volatility data was computed using the daily closing prices for the selected companies' shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of the share-based payments. The Company will continue to analyze the historical stock price volatility and expected term assumptions as more historical data for the Company's common stock becomes available.\nRisk-free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the options.\nDividend Rate. We assumed the expected dividend to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to do so.\nExpected Forfeiture Rate. As allowed under ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, we account for forfeitures as they occur.\nService Period. We amortize all stock-based compensation over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the same as the vesting period of the awards. We amortize the stock-based compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the expected service periods.\nIf factors change and we employ different assumptions, stock-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock-based compensation expense. To the extent that our assumptions are incorrect, the amount of stock-based compensation recorded will change.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nAs an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of the exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition and operations of a commercial-stage medical device company that designs, manufactures, and sells image-guided, catheter-based systems used to treat peripheral artery disease.

This discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage medical device company that designs, manufactures and sells image-guided, catheter-based systems that are used by physicians to treat patients with peripheral artery disease, or PAD. Patients with PAD have a build-up of plaque in the arteries that supply blood to areas away from the heart, particularly the pelvis and legs. Our mission is to significantly improve the treatment of vascular disease through the introduction of products based on our Lumivascular platform, the only intravascular image-guided system available in this market. We manufacture and sell a suite of products in the United States and select international markets. Our current products include our Lightbox imaging console, the Ocelot family of catheters, which are designed to allow physicians to penetrate a total blockage in an artery, known as a chronic total occlusion, or CTO, and Pantheris, our image-guided atherectomy device which is designed to allow physicians to precisely remove arterial plaque in PAD patients. We received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for commercialization of Pantheris in October 2015. We received an additional 510(k) clearance for an enhanced version of Pantheris in March 2016 and commenced sales of Pantheris in the United States and select European countries promptly thereafter. In May 2018, the Company also received 510(K) clearance from the FDA for its current next-generation version of Pantheris. The Company has sales in the U.S. and select international markets. The Company is located in Redwood City, California. The Company submitted a 510(k) filing in respect of Pantheris SV (Small Vessel), a lower profile Pantheris, in August 2018 and received CE Marking for Pantheris SV in October 2018.We also offer the Wildcat and Kittycat 2 catheters, which are used for crossing CTOs but do not contain on-board imaging technology.\nWe are developing a next-generation version of our Pantheris atherectomy device, Pantheris SV, a lower profile Pantheris. The lower profile Pantheris has a smaller diameter and longer length that we believe will optimize it for use in smaller vessels. We submitted a 510(k) application for Pantheris SV in smaller vessels in August 2018 and received CE Marking approval in October 2018. In addition, we completed development of our next-generation Pantheris which we believe represents a significant improvement over our prior product. Our next-generation Pantheris includes new features and design improvements to the handle, shaft, balloon and nose cone that we believe improves usability and reliability. Our next-generation Pantheris received CE Marking approval in December 2017 and was cleared by the FDA in May 2018. The next-generation Pantheris is available for commercial sale in the EU and United States.\nDuring the first quarter of 2015, we completed enrollment of patients in VISION, a clinical trial designed to support our August 2015 510(k) filing with the FDA for our Pantheris atherectomy device. VISION was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pantheris to perform atherectomy using intravascular imaging and successfully achieved all primary and secondary safety and efficacy endpoints. We believe the data from VISION allows us to demonstrate that avoiding damage to healthy arterial structures, and in particular disruption of the external elastic lamina, which is the membrane between the outermost layers of the artery, reduces the likelihood of restenosis, or re-narrowing, of the diseased artery. Although the original VISION study protocol was not designed to follow patients beyond six months, we have worked with 18 of the VISION sites to re-solicit consent from previous clinical trial patients in order for them to evaluate patient outcomes through 12 and 24 months following initial treatment. Data collection for the remaining patients from participating sites was completed in May 2017, and we released the final 12- and 24-month results for a total of 89 patients in July 2017. We commenced commercialization of Pantheris as part of our Lumivascular platform in the United States and in select international markets in March 2016, after obtaining the required marketing authorizations. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we began enrolling patients in INSIGHT, a clinical trial designed to support a filing with the FDA to expand the indication for our Pantheris atherectomy device to include in-stent restenosis. Patient enrollment began in October 2017 and is expected to continue through early 2019. Patient outcomes will be evaluated at thirty days, six months and one year following treatment. We plan to submit a 510(k) application with the FDA seeking a specific indication for treating in-stent restenosis with Pantheris once the trial is fully enrolled and follow-up data through six months are available and analyzed.\nWe focus our direct sales force, marketing efforts and promotional activities on interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists. We also work on developing strong relationships with physicians and hospitals that we have identified as key opinion leaders. Although our sales and marketing efforts are directed at these physicians because they are the primary users of our technology, we consider the hospitals and medical centers where the procedure is performed to be our customers, as they typically are responsible for purchasing our products. We are designing future products to be compatible with our Lumivascular platform, which we expect to enhance the value proposition for hospitals to invest in our technology. Pantheris qualifies for existing reimbursement codes currently utilized by other atherectomy products, further facilitating adoption of our products.\nPrior to the introduction of our Lumivascular platform our non-imaging catheter products were manufactured by third parties. All of our products are now manufactured in-house at our facilities in Redwood City, California using components and sub-assemblies manufactured both in-house and by outside vendors. We assemble all of our products at our manufacturing facility, but certain critical processes such as coating and sterilization are done by outside vendors. We expect our current manufacturing facility will be sufficient through at least 2019.\nIn addition to commercialization of Pantheris in the United States and select international markets in March 2016, we began commercializing our initial non-Lumivascular platform products in 2009 and introduced our Lumivascular platform products in the United States in late 2012. We generated revenues of $7.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 and $9.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our net loss and comprehensive loss was $27.6 million and $48.7 million, respectively. We have not been profitable since inception, and as of December 31, 2018, our accumulated deficit was $328.9 million. Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily through private and public placements of our preferred and common securities and, to a lesser extent, debt financing arrangements. In January 2015, we completed an initial public offering, or IPO, of 125,000 shares. As a result of our IPO, which closed in February 2015, we received net proceeds of approximately $56.9 million, after underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $4.5 million and other expenses associated with our IPO of approximately $3.6 million.\nIn September 2015, we entered into a Term Loan Agreement, or Loan Agreement, with CRG Partners III L.P. and certain of its affiliated funds, collectively CRG, under which we were able to borrow up to $50.0 million on or before March 29, 2017, subject to certain terms and conditions. We borrowed $30.0 million on September 22, 2015 and an additional $10.0 million on June 15, 2016 under the Loan Agreement. Contingent on achievement of certain revenue milestones, among other conditions, we would have been eligible to borrow an additional $10.0 million, on or prior to March 29, 2017; however, we did not achieve the level of revenues required to borrow the final $10.0 million. Contemporaneously with the execution of the Loan Agreement, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with CRG, pursuant to which CRG purchased 8,705 shares of our common stock on September 22, 2015 at a price of $559.64 per share, which represents the 10-day average of closing prices of our common stock ending on September 21, 2015. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, we filed a registration statement covering the resale of the shares sold to CRG and must comply with certain affirmative covenants during the time that such registration statement remains in effect. We used the proceeds from the CRG borrowing and securities purchase to retire our outstanding principal and accrued interest with PDL Biopharma, or PDL, and to retire the principal and accrued interest underlying our outstanding promissory notes, or the notes.\nOn February 3, 2016, we filed a universal shelf registration statement to offer up to $150.0 million of our securities and entered into an at-the-market\u201d program pursuant to a Sales Agreement with Cowen and Company, or Cowen, through which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of common stock having an aggregate offering value of up to $50.0 million. The shelf registration statement also covers the resale of the shares sold to CRG. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on March 8, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold 27,374 shares of common stock through the at-the-market\u201d program at an average price of $194.74 and raised net proceeds of $5.2 million, after payment of $0.2 million in commissions and fees to Cowen. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold 189,684 shares of common stock through the at-the-market\u201d program at an average price of $17.68 and raised net proceeds of $3.2 million, after payment of $0.1 million in commissions and fees to Cowen. Due to the SEC's baby shelf rules,\u201d which prohibit companies with a public float of less than $75 million from issuing securities under a shelf registration statement in excess of one-third of such company's public float in a twelve-month period, at this time we are unable to issue more shares through our at-the-market\u201d program. In addition, in August 2016 we completed a follow-on public offering of 246,445 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $31.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $2.4 million and other expenses of approximately $0.6 million. The 246,445 shares include the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 32,145 shares of our common stock.\nIn April 2017, we undertook an organizational realignment which included a reduction in force, that lowered our total headcount by approximately 33% compared to December 31, 2016. The organizational realignment was designed to focus our commercial efforts on driving catheter utilization in our strongest markets, around our most productive sales professionals. Our field sales personnel headcount was reduced to 32, down from 60 as of December 31, 2016. This workforce reduction was designed to reduce operating expenses while continuing to support major product development and clinical initiatives. The strategic reduction in the field sales force was designed to maintain robust engagement with higher volume users of our Lumivascular technology and position us to increase utilization of our catheters within our installed base of accounts in 2018 following the launch of our next generation products. In September 2017, we effected a cost reduction plan, which also included a company-wide reduction in force, lowering our total headcount by an additional 24 employees. Our field sales personnel headcount was further reduced to a total of 20 people. In addition, as part of the cost reduction plan, in October 2017, we subleased a portion of the Company's facilities and consolidated our operations primarily into one building.\nOn November 3, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, or Lincoln Park, pursuant to which Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase, at our request, up to $15.0 million of our common stock over a 30-month period, subject to certain limitations set forth in the purchase agreement (the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement\u201d). As a fee for Lincoln Park's commitment to purchase such shares, we issued 23,584 shares of common stock to Lincoln Park on November 3, 2017. As obligated under a registration rights agreement entered into with Lincoln Park in connection with the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 on November 6, 2017 for up to 248,750 of such shares, which registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on November 17, 2017.\nOn February 14, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Term Loan Agreement (the Amendment No. 2 Loan Agreement\u201d) with CRG. Under its terms, the Amendment No. 2 Loan Agreement, among other things: (1) extended the interest-only period through June 30, 2021; (2) extended the period during which the Company may elect to pay a portion of interest in payment-in-kind, or PIK, interest payments through June 30, 2021 so long as no default has occurred and is continuing; (3) permitted the Company to make its entire interest payments in PIK interest payments for through December 31, 2019 so long as no default has occurred and is continuing; (4) extended the maturity date to June 30, 2023; (5) reduced the minimum liquidity requirement to $3.5 million at all times; (6) eliminated the minimum revenue covenant for 2018 and 2019; (7) reduced the minimum revenue covenant to $15 million for 2020, $20 million for 2021 and $25 million for 2022; and (8) provided CRG with board observer rights.\nIn addition, on February 14, 2018, we entered into a Series A preferred stock Purchase Agreement (the Series A Purchase Agreement\u201d) with CRG, pursuant to which it agreed to convert $38.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of its senior secured term loan (plus the back-end fee and prepayment premium applicable thereto) under the Loan Agreement into a newly authorized Series A preferred stock. As discussed in the section of this report titled Dividend Policy,\u201d the holders of Series A preferred stock are entitled to receive annual accruing dividends at a rate of 8%, payable in additional shares of Series A preferred stock or cash, at our option. The shares of Series A preferred stock have no voting rights and rank senior to all other classes and series of the Company's equity in terms of repayment and certain other rights. The Series A preferred stock and any of the Company's common stock issued upon conversion of the Series A preferred stock is subject to a lockup agreement through February 14, 2019.\nOn February 16, 2018, we completed a public offering of 17,979 shares of Series B preferred stock and warrants to purchase 17,979,000 shares of common stock. As a result, we received net proceeds of approximately $15.5 million after underwriting discounts, commissions, legal and accounting fees. Each share of Series B preferred stock is accompanied by one warrant that expires on the seventh anniversary of the date of issuance to purchase up to 500 shares of common stock (the Series 1 warrants\u201d) and one warrant that expires on the earlier of (i) the seventh anniversary of the date of issuance or (ii) the 60th calendar day following the receipt and announcement of FDA clearance of our Pantheris below-the-knee device (or the same or similar product with a different name) to purchase up to 500 shares of common stock; provided, however, if at any time during such 60-day period the volume weighted average price for any trading day is less than the then effective exercise price, the termination date shall be extended to the seven year anniversary of the initial exercise date (the Series 2 warrants\u201d). In addition, pursuant to the Series A Purchase Agreement, we issued to CRG 41,800 shares of Series A preferred stock at the closing of the Series B Offering. The Series A preferred stock was issued in exchange for the conversion of $38.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of their senior secured term loan (plus the back-end fee and prepayment premium applicable thereto), totaling approximately $41.8 million. The Series A preferred stock is initially convertible into 20,900,000 shares of common stock subject to certain limitations contained in the Series A Purchase Agreement.\nOn July 12, 2018, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain investors pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue, in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 2,166,180 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $1.6425 per share. In a concurrent private placement, or the Private Placement, we agreed to issue to these investors warrants exercisable for one share of our common stock for each two shares purchased in the registered direct offering, which equals an aggregate of 1,083,091 shares of common stock. The closing of such registered direct offering and the concurrent Private Placement occurred on July 16, 2018, in connection with which we received net proceeds of approximately $3.0 million after deducting placement agent fees and other expenses payable by us and the conversion price of the outstanding shares of Series B preferred stock, issued in our February 2018 offering, was reduced to $1.58 per share as a result. The warrants have an exercise price of $1.58 per share of our common stock and may be exercised from time to time beginning on January 17, 2019 and expire on July 16, 2021.\nOn November 1, 2018, we completed a public offering of 7,285,000 shares of common stock and 8,586 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock (the Series C preferred stock\u201d). As a result, we received net proceeds of approximately $10.2 million after underwriting discounts, commissions, legal and accounting fees. Upon any dissolution, liquidation or winding up, whether voluntary or involuntary, holders of Series C preferred stock will be entitled to receive distributions out of our assets, whether capital or surplus, of an amount equal to $0.001 per share of Series C preferred stock before any distributions shall be made on the common stock but after distributions shall be made on any outstanding Series A preferred stock and any of our existing or future indebtedness. The Series C preferred stock has no voting rights.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nAll of our revenues are currently derived from sales of our Lightbox console, as well as related services, and sales of our various PAD catheters in the United States and select international markets. We expect our revenues to increase in 2019 as we introduce our Pantheris small vessel device and expand our sales force. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nRevenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including capital equipment purchasing patterns that are typically increased towards the end of the calendar year and decreased in the first quarter. In addition, during the first quarter, our results can be harmed by adverse weather and by resetting of annual patient healthcare insurance plan deductibles, both of which may cause patients to delay elective procedures. In the third quarter, the number of elective procedures nationwide is historically lower than other quarters throughout the year, which we believe is primarily attributable to the summer vacations of physicians and their patients.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin\nCost of revenues consists primarily of costs related to manufacturing overhead, materials and direct labor. We expense all warranty costs and inventory provisions as cost of revenues. We periodically write-down inventory for estimated excess, obsolete and non-sellable inventories based on assumptions about future demand, past usage, changes to manufacturing processes and overall market conditions. A significant portion of our cost of revenues currently consists of manufacturing overhead costs. These overhead costs include the cost of quality assurance, material procurement, inventory control, facilities, equipment and operations supervision and management. We expect overhead costs as a percentage of revenues to become less significant as our production volume increases. Cost of revenues also includes depreciation expense for production equipment, depreciation and related maintenance expense for placed Lightboxes held by customers and certain direct costs such as those incurred for shipping our products.\nWe calculate gross margin as gross profit divided by revenues. Our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, primarily production volumes, manufacturing costs, product yields, headcount, charges for excess and obsolete inventories and cost-reduction strategies. We expect our gross margin to increase over the long term as our production volume increases and as we spread the fixed portion of our manufacturing overhead costs over a larger number of units produced, thereby reducing our per unit manufacturing costs. We intend to use our design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities to further advance and improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes, which we believe will reduce costs and increase our gross margin. In the future, we may seek to manufacture certain of our products outside the United States to further reduce costs. Our gross margin will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter as we continue to introduce new products and sales channels, and as we adopt new manufacturing processes and technologies.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development, or R&D, expenses consist primarily of engineering, product development, clinical and regulatory affairs, consulting services, materials, depreciation and other costs associated with products and technologies in development. These expenses include employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, supplies, materials, quality assurance expenses allocated to R&D programs, consulting, related travel expenses and facilities expenses. Clinical expenses include clinical trial design, clinical site reimbursement, data management, travel expenses and the cost of manufacturing products for clinical trials. We expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues to vary over time depending on the level and timing of our new product development efforts, as well as our clinical development, clinical trial and other related activities.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses consist primarily of compensation for personnel, including stock-based compensation, related to selling and marketing functions, physician education programs, business development, finance, information technology and human resource functions. Other SG&A expenses include commissions, training, travel expenses, educational and promotional activities, marketing initiatives, market research and analysis, conferences and trade shows, professional services fees, including legal, audit and tax fees, insurance costs, general corporate expenses and allocated facilities-related expenses. We expect SG&A expenses to remain relatively flat compared to the prior year.\nInterest Income (Expense), net\nInterest income (expense), net consists primarily of interest incurred on our outstanding indebtedness and non-cash interest related to the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs associated with our various debt agreements.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign exchange transactions.\nResults of Operations:\n\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nRevenues. Revenues decreased $2.0 million, or 20.4%, to $7.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $9.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decreased revenues in 2018 reflect the impact of the reduced size of our field sales force.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin. Cost of revenues decreased $6.5 million, or 50%, to $6.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $13.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower excess and obsolescence charges predominantly related to our Lightbox and Pantheris inventories and our decreased sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 reflecting the impact of the reduced size of our sales force. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to 17% compared to -31% in the year ended December 31, 2017. Stock-based compensation expense within cost of revenues totaled $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nResearch and Development Expenses. R&D expenses decreased $5.3 million, or 47%, to $6.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $11.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related expenses as a result of fewer employees and lower project spending due to completion of projects previously in process. Stock-based compensation expense within R&D totaled $0.5 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses decreased $7.7 million, or 31%, to $17.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $25.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related expenses as a result of fewer employees and lower professional services expenses. Stock-based compensation expense within SG&A totaled $2.4 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nRestructuring. In April, September and October 2017, we undertook organizational realignment and cost reduction activities to conserve resources which included reductions in force that lowered our total headcount and the sublease of one of our facilities. We recorded $1.3 million in restructuring charges during the year ended December 31, 2017, which consisted of severance related costs specific to the termination of 44 and 24 employees in April and September 2017, respectively, and an operating lease related liability for one of our facilities.\nLitigation Settlement. Between May 22, 2017 and May 25, 2017, three class actions were filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Mateo, or the State Court, against us and certain of our officers and directors. The underwriters of our IPO in January 2015 were also named as defendants. These lawsuits allege that the registration statement for our IPO made false and misleading statements and omissions in violation of the Securities Act of 1933. Plaintiffs sought, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages, interest, costs, recission, and attorneys' fees.\nThe Company and its directors believe that the foregoing lawsuits were without merit; however, in the interest of avoiding the cost and disruption of continuing to defend against these lawsuits, the Company entered into a settlement of the actions. The settlement is for a total of $5 million. The Company's total contribution to the settlement fund was $1.76 million, which was expensed in 2017 and paid in March 2018. On October 24, 2018, the court approved the settlement.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net. Interest income (expense), net decreased $0.6 million, or 19%, to an expense of $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to an expense of $6.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The reason for the decrease is primarily due to CRG's conversion of $38.0 million in outstanding principal and interest into Series A preferred stock in connection with our February 2018 public offering. Additionally, amortization of the debt discount recorded in connection with the issuance of the debt was converted as a result of our offering.\nOther income (expense), net was not significant for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Other income was primarily attributable to the remeasurement of foreign exchange transactions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $16.4 million and an accumulated deficit of $328.9 million, compared to cash and cash equivalents of $5.4 million and an accumulated deficit of $301.3 million as of December 31, 2017. We do not know when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our ongoing operations. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any additional debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders and require significant debt service payments, which divert resources", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management.

Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage medical device company that designs, manufactures and sells image-guided, catheter-based systems that are used by physicians to treat patients with peripheral artery disease, or PAD. Patients with PAD have a build-up of plaque in the arteries that supply blood to areas away from the heart, particularly the pelvis and legs. Our mission is to significantly improve the treatment of vascular disease through the introduction of products based on our Lumivascular platform, the only intravascular image-guided system available in this market. We manufacture and sell a suite of products in the United States and select international markets. Our current products include our Lightbox imaging console, the Ocelot family of catheters, which are designed to allow physicians to penetrate a total blockage in an artery, known as a chronic total occlusion, or CTO, and Pantheris, our image-guided atherectomy device which is designed to allow physicians to precisely remove arterial plaque in PAD patients. We received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for commercialization of Pantheris in October 2015. We received an additional 510(k) clearance for an enhanced version of Pantheris in March 2016 and commenced sales of Pantheris in the United States and select European countries promptly thereafter. In May 2018, the Company also received 510(K) clearance from the FDA for its current next-generation version of Pantheris. The Company has sales in the U.S. and select international markets. The Company is located in Redwood City, California. The Company submitted a 510(k) filing in respect of Pantheris SV (Small Vessel), a lower profile Pantheris, in August 2018 and received CE Marking for Pantheris SV in October 2018.We also offer the Wildcat and Kittycat 2 catheters, which are used for crossing CTOs but do not contain on-board imaging technology.\nWe are developing a next-generation version of our Pantheris atherectomy device, Pantheris SV, a lower profile Pantheris. The lower profile Pantheris has a smaller diameter and longer length that we believe will optimize it for use in smaller vessels. We submitted a 510(k) application for Pantheris SV in smaller vessels in August 2018 and received CE Marking approval in October 2018. In addition, we completed development of our next-generation Pantheris which we believe represents a significant improvement over our prior product. Our next-generation Pantheris includes new features and design improvements to the handle, shaft, balloon and nose cone that we believe improves usability and reliability. Our next-generation Pantheris received CE Marking approval in December 2017 and was cleared by the FDA in May 2018. The next-generation Pantheris is available for commercial sale in the EU and United States.\nDuring the first quarter of 2015, we completed enrollment of patients in VISION, a clinical trial designed to support our August 2015 510(k) filing with the FDA for our Pantheris atherectomy device. VISION was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pantheris to perform atherectomy using intravascular imaging and successfully achieved all primary and secondary safety and efficacy endpoints. We believe the data from VISION allows us to demonstrate that avoiding damage to healthy arterial structures, and in particular disruption of the external elastic lamina, which is the membrane between the outermost layers of the artery, reduces the likelihood of restenosis, or re-narrowing, of the diseased artery. Although the original VISION study protocol was not designed to follow patients beyond six months, we have worked with 18 of the VISION sites to re-solicit consent from previous clinical trial patients in order for them to evaluate patient outcomes through 12 and 24 months following initial treatment. Data collection for the remaining patients from participating sites was completed in May 2017, and we released the final 12- and 24-month results for a total of 89 patients in July 2017. We commenced commercialization of Pantheris as part of our Lumivascular platform in the United States and in select international markets in March 2016, after obtaining the required marketing authorizations. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we began enrolling patients in INSIGHT, a clinical trial designed to support a filing with the FDA to expand the indication for our Pantheris atherectomy device to include in-stent restenosis. Patient enrollment began in October 2017 and is expected to continue through early 2019. Patient outcomes will be evaluated at thirty days, six months and one year following treatment. We plan to submit a 510(k) application with the FDA seeking a specific indication for treating in-stent restenosis with Pantheris once the trial is fully enrolled and follow-up data through six months are available and analyzed.\nWe focus our direct sales force, marketing efforts and promotional activities on interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists. We also work on developing strong relationships with physicians and hospitals that we have identified as key opinion leaders. Although our sales and marketing efforts are directed at these physicians because they are the primary users of our technology, we consider the hospitals and medical centers where the procedure is performed to be our customers, as they typically are responsible for purchasing our products. We are designing future products to be compatible with our Lumivascular platform, which we expect to enhance the value proposition for hospitals to invest in our technology. Pantheris qualifies for existing reimbursement codes currently utilized by other atherectomy products, further facilitating adoption of our products.\nPrior to the introduction of our Lumivascular platform our non-imaging catheter products were manufactured by third parties. All of our products are now manufactured in-house at our facilities in Redwood City, California using components and sub-assemblies manufactured both in-house and by outside vendors. We assemble all of our products at our manufacturing facility, but certain critical processes such as coating and sterilization are done by outside vendors. We expect our current manufacturing facility will be sufficient through at least 2019.\nIn addition to commercialization of Pantheris in the United States and select international markets in March 2016, we began commercializing our initial non-Lumivascular platform products in 2009 and introduced our Lumivascular platform products in the United States in late 2012. We generated revenues of $7.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 and $9.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our net loss and comprehensive loss was $27.6 million and $48.7 million, respectively. We have not been profitable since inception, and as of December 31, 2018, our accumulated deficit was $328.9 million. Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily through private and public placements of our preferred and common securities and, to a lesser extent, debt financing arrangements. In January 2015, we completed an initial public offering, or IPO, of 125,000 shares. As a result of our IPO, which closed in February 2015, we received net proceeds of approximately $56.9 million, after underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $4.5 million and other expenses associated with our IPO of approximately $3.6 million.\nIn September 2015, we entered into a Term Loan Agreement, or Loan Agreement, with CRG Partners III L.P. and certain of its affiliated funds, collectively CRG, under which we were able to borrow up to $50.0 million on or before March 29, 2017, subject to certain terms and conditions. We borrowed $30.0 million on September 22, 2015 and an additional $10.0 million on June 15, 2016 under the Loan Agreement. Contingent on achievement of certain revenue milestones, among other conditions, we would have been eligible to borrow an additional $10.0 million, on or prior to March 29, 2017; however, we did not achieve the level of revenues required to borrow the final $10.0 million. Contemporaneously with the execution of the Loan Agreement, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with CRG, pursuant to which CRG purchased 8,705 shares of our common stock on September 22, 2015 at a price of $559.64 per share, which represents the 10-day average of closing prices of our common stock ending on September 21, 2015. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, we filed a registration statement covering the resale of the shares sold to CRG and must comply with certain affirmative covenants during the time that such registration statement remains in effect. We used the proceeds from the CRG borrowing and securities purchase to retire our outstanding principal and accrued interest with PDL Biopharma, or PDL, and to retire the principal and accrued interest underlying our outstanding promissory notes, or the notes.\nOn February 3, 2016, we filed a universal shelf registration statement to offer up to $150.0 million of our securities and entered into an at-the-market\u201d program pursuant to a Sales Agreement with Cowen and Company, or Cowen, through which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of common stock having an aggregate offering value of up to $50.0 million. The shelf registration statement also covers the resale of the shares sold to CRG. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on March 8, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold 27,374 shares of common stock through the at-the-market\u201d program at an average price of $194.74 and raised net proceeds of $5.2 million, after payment of $0.2 million in commissions and fees to Cowen. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold 189,684 shares of common stock through the at-the-market\u201d program at an average price of $17.68 and raised net proceeds of $3.2 million, after payment of $0.1 million in commissions and fees to Cowen. Due to the SEC's baby shelf rules,\u201d which prohibit companies with a public float of less than $75 million from issuing securities under a shelf registration statement in excess of one-third of such company's public float in a twelve-month period, at this time we are unable to issue more shares through our at-the-market\u201d program. In addition, in August 2016 we completed a follow-on public offering of 246,445 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $31.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $2.4 million and other expenses of approximately $0.6 million. The 246,445 shares include the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 32,145 shares of our common stock.\nIn April 2017, we undertook an organizational realignment which included a reduction in force, that lowered our total headcount by approximately 33% compared to December 31, 2016. The organizational realignment was designed to focus our commercial efforts on driving catheter utilization in our strongest markets, around our most productive sales professionals. Our field sales personnel headcount was reduced to 32, down from 60 as of December 31, 2016. This workforce reduction was designed to reduce operating expenses while continuing to support major product development and clinical initiatives. The strategic reduction in the field sales force was designed to maintain robust engagement with higher volume users of our Lumivascular technology and position us to increase utilization of our catheters within our installed base of accounts in 2018 following the launch of our next generation products. In September 2017, we effected a cost reduction plan, which also included a company-wide reduction in force, lowering our total headcount by an additional 24 employees. Our field sales personnel headcount was further reduced to a total of 20 people. In addition, as part of the cost reduction plan, in October 2017, we subleased a portion of the Company's facilities and consolidated our operations primarily into one building.\nOn November 3, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, or Lincoln Park, pursuant to which Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase, at our request, up to $15.0 million of our common stock over a 30-month period, subject to certain limitations set forth in the purchase agreement (the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement\u201d). As a fee for Lincoln Park's commitment to purchase such shares, we issued 23,584 shares of common stock to Lincoln Park on November 3, 2017. As obligated under a registration rights agreement entered into with Lincoln Park in connection with the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 on November 6, 2017 for up to 248,750 of such shares, which registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on November 17, 2017.\nOn February 14, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Term Loan Agreement (the Amendment No. 2 Loan Agreement\u201d) with CRG. Under its terms, the Amendment No. 2 Loan Agreement, among other things: (1) extended the interest-only period through June 30, 2021; (2) extended the period during which the Company may elect to pay a portion of interest in payment-in-kind, or PIK, interest payments through June 30, 2021 so long as no default has occurred and is continuing; (3) permitted the Company to make its entire interest payments in PIK interest payments for through December 31, 2019 so long as no default has occurred and is continuing; (4) extended the maturity date to June 30, 2023; (5) reduced the minimum liquidity requirement to $3.5 million at all times; (6) eliminated the minimum revenue covenant for 2018 and 2019; (7) reduced the minimum revenue covenant to $15 million for 2020, $20 million for 2021 and $25 million for 2022; and (8) provided CRG with board observer rights.\nIn addition, on February 14, 2018, we entered into a Series A preferred stock Purchase Agreement (the Series A Purchase Agreement\u201d) with CRG, pursuant to which it agreed to convert $38.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of its senior secured term loan (plus the back-end fee and prepayment premium applicable thereto) under the Loan Agreement into a newly authorized Series A preferred stock. As discussed in the section of this report titled Dividend Policy,\u201d the holders of Series A preferred stock are entitled to receive annual accruing dividends at a rate of 8%, payable in additional shares of Series A preferred stock or cash, at our option. The shares of Series A preferred stock have no voting rights and rank senior to all other classes and series of the Company's equity in terms of repayment and certain other rights. The Series A preferred stock and any of the Company's common stock issued upon conversion of the Series A preferred stock is subject to a lockup agreement through February 14, 2019.\nOn February 16, 2018, we completed a public offering of 17,979 shares of Series B preferred stock and warrants to purchase 17,979,000 shares of common stock. As a result, we received net proceeds of approximately $15.5 million after underwriting discounts, commissions, legal and accounting fees. Each share of Series B preferred stock is accompanied by one warrant that expires on the seventh anniversary of the date of issuance to purchase up to 500 shares of common stock (the Series 1 warrants\u201d) and one warrant that expires on the earlier of (i) the seventh anniversary of the date of issuance or (ii) the 60th calendar day following the receipt and announcement of FDA clearance of our Pantheris below-the-knee device (or the same or similar product with a different name) to purchase up to 500 shares of common stock; provided, however, if at any time during such 60-day period the volume weighted average price for any trading day is less than the then effective exercise price, the termination date shall be extended to the seven year anniversary of the initial exercise date (the Series 2 warrants\u201d). In addition, pursuant to the Series A Purchase Agreement, we issued to CRG 41,800 shares of Series A preferred stock at the closing of the Series B Offering. The Series A preferred stock was issued in exchange for the conversion of $38.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of their senior secured term loan (plus the back-end fee and prepayment premium applicable thereto), totaling approximately $41.8 million. The Series A preferred stock is initially convertible into 20,900,000 shares of common stock subject to certain limitations contained in the Series A Purchase Agreement.\nOn July 12, 2018, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain investors pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue, in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 2,166,180 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $1.6425 per share. In a concurrent private placement, or the Private Placement, we agreed to issue to these investors warrants exercisable for one share of our common stock for each two shares purchased in the registered direct offering, which equals an aggregate of 1,083,091 shares of common stock. The closing of such registered direct offering and the concurrent Private Placement occurred on July 16, 2018, in connection with which we received net proceeds of approximately $3.0 million after deducting placement agent fees and other expenses payable by us and the conversion price of the outstanding shares of Series B preferred stock, issued in our February 2018 offering, was reduced to $1.58 per share as a result. The warrants have an exercise price of $1.58 per share of our common stock and may be exercised from time to time beginning on January 17, 2019 and expire on July 16, 2021.\nOn November 1, 2018, we completed a public offering of 7,285,000 shares of common stock and 8,586 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock (the Series C preferred stock\u201d). As a result, we received net proceeds of approximately $10.2 million after underwriting discounts, commissions, legal and accounting fees. Upon any dissolution, liquidation or winding up, whether voluntary or involuntary, holders of Series C preferred stock will be entitled to receive distributions out of our assets, whether capital or surplus, of an amount equal to $0.001 per share of Series C preferred stock before any distributions shall be made on the common stock but after distributions shall be made on any outstanding Series A preferred stock and any of our existing or future indebtedness. The Series C preferred stock has no voting rights.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nAll of our revenues are currently derived from sales of our Lightbox console, as well as related services, and sales of our various PAD catheters in the United States and select international markets. We expect our revenues to increase in 2019 as we introduce our Pantheris small vessel device and expand our sales force. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nRevenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including capital equipment purchasing patterns that are typically increased towards the end of the calendar year and decreased in the first quarter. In addition, during the first quarter, our results can be harmed by adverse weather and by resetting of annual patient healthcare insurance plan deductibles, both of which may cause patients to delay elective procedures. In the third quarter, the number of elective procedures nationwide is historically lower than other quarters throughout the year, which we believe is primarily attributable to the summer vacations of physicians and their patients.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin\nCost of revenues consists primarily of costs related to manufacturing overhead, materials and direct labor. We expense all warranty costs and inventory provisions as cost of revenues. We periodically write-down inventory for estimated excess, obsolete and non-sellable inventories based on assumptions about future demand, past usage, changes to manufacturing processes and overall market conditions. A significant portion of our cost of revenues currently consists of manufacturing overhead costs. These overhead costs include the cost of quality assurance, material procurement, inventory control, facilities, equipment and operations supervision and management. We expect overhead costs as a percentage of revenues to become less significant as our production volume increases. Cost of revenues also includes depreciation expense for production equipment, depreciation and related maintenance expense for placed Lightboxes held by customers and certain direct costs such as those incurred for shipping our products.\nWe calculate gross margin as gross profit divided by revenues. Our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, primarily production volumes, manufacturing costs, product yields, headcount, charges for excess and obsolete inventories and cost-reduction strategies. We expect our gross margin to increase over the long term as our production volume increases and as we spread the fixed portion of our manufacturing overhead costs over a larger number of units produced, thereby reducing our per unit manufacturing costs. We intend to use our design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities to further advance and improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes, which we believe will reduce costs and increase our gross margin. In the future, we may seek to manufacture certain of our products outside the United States to further reduce costs. Our gross margin will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter as we continue to introduce new products and sales channels, and as we adopt new manufacturing processes and technologies.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development, or R&D, expenses consist primarily of engineering, product development, clinical and regulatory affairs, consulting services, materials, depreciation and other costs associated with products and technologies in development. These expenses include employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, supplies, materials, quality assurance expenses allocated to R&D programs, consulting, related travel expenses and facilities expenses. Clinical expenses include clinical trial design, clinical site reimbursement, data management, travel expenses and the cost of manufacturing products for clinical trials. We expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues to vary over time depending on the level and timing of our new product development efforts, as well as our clinical development, clinical trial and other related activities.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses consist primarily of compensation for personnel, including stock-based compensation, related to selling and marketing functions, physician education programs, business development, finance, information technology and human resource functions. Other SG&A expenses include commissions, training, travel expenses, educational and promotional activities, marketing initiatives, market research and analysis, conferences and trade shows, professional services fees, including legal, audit and tax fees, insurance costs, general corporate expenses and allocated facilities-related expenses. We expect SG&A expenses to remain relatively flat compared to the prior year.\nInterest Income (Expense), net\nInterest income (expense), net consists primarily of interest incurred on our outstanding indebtedness and non-cash interest related to the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs associated with our various debt agreements.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign exchange transactions.\nResults of Operations:\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,915 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,934 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,531 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,002 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,068 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-31 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,319 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,120 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring charges\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,285 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Litigation settlement\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,760 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,484 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,067 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42,552 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income (expense), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,478 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,191 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss and comprehensive loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(27,558 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(48,732 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nRevenues. Revenues decreased $2.0 million, or 20.4%, to $7.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $9.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decreased revenues in 2018 reflect the impact of the reduced size of our field sales force.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin. Cost of revenues decreased $6.5 million, or 50%, to $6.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $13.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower excess and obsolescence charges predominantly related to our Lightbox and Pantheris inventories and our decreased sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 reflecting the impact of the reduced size of our sales force. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to 17% compared to -31% in the year ended December 31, 2017. Stock-based compensation expense within cost of revenues totaled $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nResearch and Development Expenses. R&D expenses decreased $5.3 million, or 47%, to $6.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $11.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related expenses as a result of fewer employees and lower project spending due to completion of projects previously in process. Stock-based compensation expense within R&D totaled $0.5 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses decreased $7.7 million, or 31%, to $17.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $25.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related expenses as a result of fewer employees and lower professional services expenses. Stock-based compensation expense within SG&A totaled $2.4 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nRestructuring. In April, September and October 2017, we undertook organizational realignment and cost reduction activities to conserve resources which included reductions in force that lowered our total headcount and the sublease of one of our facilities. We recorded $1.3 million in restructuring charges during the year ended December 31, 2017, which consisted of severance related costs specific to the termination of 44 and 24 employees in April and September 2017, respectively, and an operating lease related liability for one of our facilities.\nLitigation Settlement. Between May 22, 2017 and May 25, 2017, three class actions were filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Mateo, or the State Court, against us and certain of our officers and directors. The underwriters of our IPO in January 2015 were also named as defendants. These lawsuits allege that the registration statement for our IPO made false and misleading statements and omissions in violation of the Securities Act of 1933. Plaintiffs sought, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages, interest, costs, recission, and attorneys' fees.\nThe Company and its directors believe that the foregoing lawsuits were without merit; however, in the interest of avoiding the cost and disruption of continuing to defend against these lawsuits, the Company entered into a settlement of the actions. The settlement is for a total of $5 million. The Company's total contribution to the settlement fund was $1.76 million, which was expensed in 2017 and paid in March 2018. On October 24, 2018, the court approved the settlement.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net. Interest income (expense), net decreased $0.6 million, or 19%, to an expense of $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to an expense of $6.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The reason for the decrease is primarily due to CRG's conversion of $38.0 million in outstanding principal and interest into Series A preferred stock in connection with our February 2018 public offering. Additionally, amortization of the debt discount recorded in connection with the issuance of the debt was converted as a result of our offering.\nOther income (expense), net was not significant for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Other income was primarily attributable to the remeasurement of foreign exchange transactions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $16.4 million and an accumulated deficit of $328.9 million, compared to cash and cash equivalents of $5.4 million and an accumulated deficit of $301.3 million as of December 31, 2017. We do not know when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our ongoing operations. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any additional debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders and require significant debt service payments, which divert resources"}
