Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nExecutive Summary\nWe are an independent Denver-based exploration and production company focused on the acquisition, development, and extraction of oil and associated liquids-rich natural gas in the United States. Our oil and liquids-weighted assets and operations are concentrated in the rural portions of the Wattenberg Field in Colorado. Our development and extraction activities are primarily directed at the horizontal development of the Niobrara and Codell formations in the DJ Basin. We intend to continue to develop our reserves and increase production through drilling and exploration activities on our multi-year inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives. The majority of our revenues are generated through the sale of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production.\nFinancial and Operating Results\nOur 2018 financial and operational results include:\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Wattenberg Field lease operating expense decreased 18% on a per Boe basis for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net cash provided by operating activities was $116.6 million as of December 31, 2018;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Total liquidity of $312.9 million at December 31, 2018, consisting of our year-end cash balance plus funds available under the Current Credit Facility;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Wattenberg Field sales volumes increased by 24% for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Rapidly improving well performance yielded over 1,000 SRL equivalent economic drilling locations in Wattenberg Field;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Secured our $750.0 million Current Credit Facility with a borrowing base of $350.0 million on December 7, 2018;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 243: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Wattenberg Field proved reserves of 116.8 MMBoe as of December 31, 2018 increased 29% when compared to the same period in 2017;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 244: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>PV-10 reserve value increased by 60% to $955.0 million as of December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 245: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Divested of our Mid-Continent assets for net proceeds of $102.9 million and our North Park Basin assets for minimal net proceeds and full release of all current and future obligations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Invested $275.3 million to drill 78 gross wells and turning to sales 42 gross wells;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 247: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continued to increase our takeaway capacity utilizing four gas processors via eleven interconnects.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Chief Executive Officer Appointment\nEffective April 11, 2018, the Company appointed Eric T.

The drilling and completion portion of the budget is expected to be approximately $210.0 million to $220.0 million, which will support drilling 59 gross wells and turning to sales 45 gross wells. Included in the drilling completion budget is $15.0 million for non-operated capital. Of the wells planned to be completed, 16 are XRL wells, five are MRL wells, and 24 are SRL wells. The remaining 2019 capital budget of $20.0 million to $35.0 million is to support infrastructure and leasehold costs. Actual capital expenditures could vary significantly based on, among other things, market conditions, commodity prices, drilling and completion costs, well results, and changes in the borrowing base under our Current Credit Facility.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The increased volumes are a direct result of the Company increasing the pace and efficiency of its Wattenberg development program during 2018. During the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, we turned to sales 34.4 net operated wells in the Rocky Mountain region. In addition to the overall increase of operational activity, there was an increase of $9.7 million related to the adoption of ASC 606, which caused certain revenues to be presented on a gross basis compared to a historical net presentation.

Our lease operating expense decreased $4.2 million or 11%, to $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from the combined 2017 Successor and Predecessor Periods of $39.0 million, and decreased on an equivalent basis to $5.43 per Boe from $6.68 per Boe. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of our Mid-Continent assets on August 6, 2018. The Company has also taken measures to decrease its lease operating expense, in conjunction with an increase in production, which caused the per Boe metric to further decrease. During 2018, the Company experienced decreases in its well servicing and maintenance costs of $3.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\nGas plant and midstream operating expense. Our gas plant and midstream operating expense decreased $1.1 million to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $11.9 million for the combined 2017 Successor and Predecessor Periods, and decreased on an equivalent basis to $1.68 per Boe from $2.04 per Boe. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of our Mid-Continent assets on August 6, 2018.\nGathering, transportation, and processing. As noted in the operating revenues section above, the increase in gathering, transportation, and processing expense during the year ended December 31, 2018 to $9.7 million is related to the Company's adoption of ASC 606 during 2018, which caused certain revenues to be shown gross, with the related expenses recorded in this line item. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 2 - Revenue Recognition for additional disclosures.\nSeverance and ad valorem taxes. Our severance and ad valorem taxes increased by 24% from $15.3 million for the combined 2017 Successor and Predecessor Periods to $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Severance and ad valorem taxes primarily correlate to revenue. Revenues increased by 44% for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017. The Company received a net ad valorem tax settlement of $5.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2018, which reduced this line item. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional discussion on the settlement.\nExploration. Our exploration expense decreased $7.1 million to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $7.4 million for the combined 2017 Successor and Predecessor Periods. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred $0.3 million in delay rentals. During the combined 2017 Successor and Predecessor Periods, we paid $3.8 million in delay rentals and incurred $2.9 million on abandoned well projects and $0.7 million in geological and geophysical expenses.\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization. Our depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense per Boe was $6.53, $5.66, and $13.54 for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 Successor Period, and 2017 Predecessor Period, respectively. Together, the year ended December 31, 2018 and the 2017 Successor Period (collectively, the Successor Periods\u201d) reflect the $310.6 million fair value downward adjustment to the depletable asset base upon adoption of fresh-start accounting. The increase in depreciation, depletion, and amortization during the Current Successor Period when compared to the 2017 Successor Period primarily correlates to an increase in capital expenditures.\nAbandonment and impairment of unproved properties. During the year ended December 31, 2018, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties of $5.3 million was due to the standard annual amortization of our emergence leases that were not held by production at the time of our emergence. There were no abandonment and impairment of unproved properties during the 2017 Successor and Predecessor Periods. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional discussion on our impairment policy and practices.\nUnused commitments. There were immaterial amounts of unused commitments during the year ended December 31, 2018. No amounts of unused commitments were incurred during the 2017 Successor Period. During the 2017 Predecessor Period, we incurred $1.0 million in unused commitment fees on a water supply contract in the Wattenberg Field.\nGeneral and administrative expense. Our general and administrative expense per Boe was $6.62, $11.34, and $7.28 for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 Successor Period, and 2017 Predecessor Period, respectively. The 2017 Successor Period reflects a one-time cash and non-cash $9.6 million, or $2.55 per Boe, severance charge primarily related to the Company's former Chief Executive Officer's separation from the Company. The remaining decrease in expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the combined 2017 Successor and Predecessor Periods was due to decreases in consultant restructuring fees of $5.4 million and wages and benefits of $2.7 million, partially offset by increases in employee bonuses of $1.6 million and professional services of $0.8 million.\nDerivative gain (loss). Our derivative gain for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $30.3 million as compared to a loss of $15.4 million for the 2017 Successor Period. We had no derivative contracts during the 2017 Predecessor Period. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into several oil and gas costless collars, puts, and swap contracts. Our derivative gain is primarily due to fair market value adjustments caused by market prices being lower than our contracted hedge prices. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 13 - Derivatives for additional discussion.\nInterest expense. Our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, the 2017 Successor Period, and the 2017 Predecessor Period was $2.6 million, $0.8 million, and $5.7 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred $1.4 million in interest expense associated with its Current and Prior Credit Facilities, commitment fees of $0.9 million, and miscellaneous fees of $0.3 million related to its Current and Prior Credit Facilities. The Company incurred $0.7 million in commitment fees on the available borrowing base under the Prior Credit Facility during the 2017 Successor Period. Interest expense on the Company's Senior Notes was $1.0 million for the 2017 Predecessor Period, with the remaining interest expense relating to the predecessor credit facility. The Company had no outstanding debt during the 2017 Successor Period. Average debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the 2017 Predecessor Period was $26.8 million and $991.7 million, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended

Our lease operating expense decreased $4.7 million or 11%, to $39.0 million for the 2017 Successor and 2017 Predecessor Periods from $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, but increased on an equivalent basis from $5.50 per Boe to $6.68 per Boe due to reduced production. The Company eliminated significant amounts of compression and labor costs resulting in a decrease in total compression costs of $4.1 million for the 2017 Successor and Predecessor Period when compared to the same period in 2016.\nGas plant and midstream operating expense. Our gas plant and midstream operating expense decreased $0.9 million to $11.9 million for the 2017 Successor and 2017 Predecessor Period from $12.8 million for the 2016 Predecessor Period, but increased on an equivalent basis from $1.62 per Boe to $2.04 per Boe due to reduced production. Gas plant and midstream operating expense on an aggregate basis was commensurate between the comparable periods.\nSeverance and ad valorem taxes. Our severance and ad valorem taxes remained constant between the 2017 Successor and 2017 Period and the 2016 Predecessor Period. Severance and ad valorem taxes primarily correlate to revenue. Revenues decreased by 1% for the 2017 Successor and 2017 Predecessor Period when compared to the same period in 2016.\nExploration. Our exploration expense increased $6.5 million to $7.4 million for the 2017 Successor and 2017 Predecessor Period from $0.9 million for the comparable period in 2016. During the 2017 Successor and 2017 Predecessor Period we paid $3.8 million in delay rentals and incurred $2.9 million on abandoned well projects and $0.7 million in geological and geophysical expenses. During the 2016 Predecessor Period, we incurred $0.9 million on abandoned well projects.\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization. Our depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense per Boe was $5.66, $13.54, and $14.01 for the 2017 Successor Period, 2017 Predecessor Period, and 2016 Predecessor Period, respectively. The 2017 Successor Period reflects the $310.6 million fair value downward adjustment to the depletable asset base upon adoption of fresh-start accounting.\nImpairment of oil and gas properties. There were no impairment of oil and gas properties during the 2017 Successor and 2017 Predecessor Periods. During the 2016 Predecessor Period, we incurred a $10.0 million impairment charge on our Mid-Continent assets based on the most current bid for the assets received during the first quarter of 2016, when they were held for sale. Please refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion on our impairment policy and practice.\nAbandonment and impairment of unproved properties. There were no abandonment and impairment of unproved properties during the 2017 Successor and 2017 Predecessor Periods. During the 2016 Predecessor Period, we incurred an abandonment and impairment of unproved properties charge of $24.7 million due to non-core leases expiring within the Wattenberg Field.\nUnused commitments. There were no unused commitments during the 2017 Successor Period. During the 2017 Predecessor Period, we incurred $1.0 million in unused commitment fees on a water supply contract in the Wattenberg Field. During the 2016 Predecessor Period, we incurred unused commitment fees of $7.7 million, made up of $4.3 million water commitment deficiency payments and $3.4 million purchase and transportation deficiency payments. Please refer to Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nContract settlement expense. There were no contract settlement expenses during the 2017 Successor and 2017 Predecessor Periods. During the 2016 Predecessor Period, we incurred a $21.0 million loss to settle our crude oil purchase agreement with Silo Energy, LLC as part of our bankruptcy process. Please see Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nGeneral and administrative expense. Our general and administrative expense per Boe was $11.34, $7.28 and $9.71 for the 2017 Successor Period, 2017 Predecessor Period, and 2016 Predecessor Period, respectively. The 2017 Successor Period reflects a one-time cash and non-cash $9.6 million or $2.55 per Boe severance charge primarily related to the Company's former Chief Executive Officer's separation from the Company. The 2016 Predecessor Period includes $13.3 million, or $1.68 per Boe, more in advisor fees than the comparable period in 2017. Excluding those two items, the per Boe metrics were commensurate between the periods presented.\nDerivative gain (loss). Our derivative loss for the 2017 Successor Period was $15.4 million. We had no derivative contracts during the 2017 Predecessor Period. During the 2017 Successor Period, we entered into several oil and gas costless collar and swap contracts. Our derivative loss was mainly due to fair market value adjustments caused by market prices being higher than our contracted hedge prices. Our derivative loss for the 2016 Predecessor Period was $11.2 million. Due to the Company being in default on the predecessor credit facility, all of these derivative contracts in the 2016 Predecessor Period were terminated during the fourth quarter of 2016. Please see Note 13 - Derivatives in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nInterest expense. Our interest expense for the 2017 Successor Period, 2017 Predecessor Period, and 2016 Predecessor Period was $0.8 million, $5.7 million, and $62.1 million, respectively. Upon filing its petition for Chapter 11, the Company ceased accruing interest expense on its Senior Notes. The Company incurred $0.7 million in commitment fees on the available borrowing base under the successor credit facility during the 2017 Successor Period. Interest expense on the Senior Notes was $1.0 million and $52.3 million for the 2017 Predecessor Period and 2016 Predecessor Period, respectively, with the remaining interest expense relating to the predecessor credit facility. The Company had no outstanding debt during the 2017 Successor Period. Average debt outstanding for the 2017 Predecessor Period and 2016 Predecessor Period was $991.7 million and $1.0 billion, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company's anticipated sources of liquidity include cash from operating activities, borrowings under the credit facility, proceeds from sales of assets, and potential proceeds from equity and/or debt capital markets. Our cash flows from operating activities are subject to significant volatility due to changes in commodity prices, as well as variations in our production. The prices for these commodities are driven by a number of factors beyond our control, including global and regional product supply and demand, weather, product distribution, refining and processing capacity, regulatory constraints, and other supply chain dynamics, among other factors. To mitigate some of the pricing risk, we have approximately 54% and 59% of our average 2019 guided production hedged as of December 31, 2018 and as of the filing date of this report, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our liquidity was $312.9 million, consisting of cash on hand of $12.9 million and $300.0 million of available borrowing capacity on our Current Credit Facility. As of the date of filing, we had $65.0 million outstanding on our credit facility.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows and other financial measures for the periods indicated (in thousands).\nTable 260: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 29, 2017 through December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 1, 2017 through April 28, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,884\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(164,376\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(82,641\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,022\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(67,460\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>47,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,398\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n</td> <td>13,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition of oil and gas properties\n</td> <td>2,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exploration and development of oil and gas properties\n</td> <td>264,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows (used in) provided by operating activities\nThe Current Successor and 2017 Successor Periods include cash receipts and disbursements attributable to our normal operating cycle. The 2017 and 2016 Predecessor Period contained reorganization costs along with our normal operating receipts and disbursements. See Results of Operations above for more information on the factors driving these changes.\nCash flows used in investing activities\nExpenditures for development of oil and natural gas properties are the primary use of our capital resources. The Company spent $267.1 million, $81.8 million, $5.6 million, and $52.4 million for the Current Successor Period, 2017 Successor Period, 2017 Predecessor Period, and 2016 Predecessor Period, respectively. The fluctuation in cash flows in investing activities is a direct result of the Company's current strategic emphasis on growing operational capability as well as its entrance and emergence from bankruptcy.\nCash flows (used in) provided by financing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the Current Successor Period primarily consisted of net draws of $50.0 million on our Current Credit Facility. Net cash used by financing activities for the 2017 Successor Period consisted of employee tax withholdings in exchange for the return of common stock (in conjunction with the vesting of equity awards). Net cash provided by financing activities for the 2017 Predecessor Period consisted of proceeds from the rights offering of $207.5 million net of the $191.7 million repayment to the predecessor credit facility. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted primarily of net proceeds from the predecessor credit facility of $112.7 million.\nCredit facility\nCurrent Credit Facility\nOn December 7, 2018, the Company entered into a reserve-based revolving facility, as the borrower, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent, and a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders (the Current Credit\nFacility\u201d). The Current Credit Facility has an aggregate original commitment amount of $750.0 million and matures on December 7, 2023.\nThe initial borrowing base in respect of the Current Credit Facility is $350.0 million. The first borrowing base redetermination will occur on May 1, 2019 with subsequent semi-annual redeterminations thereafter.\nBorrowings under the Current Credit Facility will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the option of the Company, either (i) a London InterBank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d), subject to a 0% LIBOR floor plus a margin of 1.75% to 2.75%, based on the utilization of the Current Credit Facility (the Eurodollar Rate\u201d) or (ii) a fluctuating interest rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the rate of interest publicly announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as its prime rate, (b) the rate of interest published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as the federal funds effective rate, (c) the rate of interest published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as the overnight bank funding rate and (d) a one month LIBOR, subject to a 0% LIBOR floor plus a margin of 0.75% to 1.75%, based on the utilization of the Current Credit Facility (the Reference Rate\u201d). Interest on borrowings that bear interest at the Eurodollar Rate shall be payable on the last day of the applicable interest period selected by the Company, which shall be one, two, three, or six months, and interest on borrowings that bear interest at the Reference Rate shall be payable quarterly in arrears.\nThe Current Credit Facility is guaranteed by all wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of the Company (each, a Guarantor\u201d and, together with the Company, the Credit Parties\u201d), and is secured by first priority security interests on substantially all assets of each Credit Party, subject to customary exceptions.\nThe Current Credit Facility contains customary representations and affirmative covenants.\nThe Current Credit Facility also contains customary negative covenants, which, among other things, and subject to certain exceptions, include restrictions on (i) liens, (ii) indebtedness, guarantees and other obligations, (iii) restrictions in agreements on liens and distributions, (iv) mergers or consolidations, (v) asset sales, (vi) restricted payments, (vii) investments, (viii) affiliate transactions, (ix) change of business, (x) foreign operations or subsidiaries, (xi) name changes, (xii) use of proceeds, letters of credit, (xiii) gas imbalances, (xiv) hedging transactions, (xv) additional subsidiaries, (xvi) changes in fiscal year or fiscal quarter, (xvii) operating leases, (xviii) prepayments of certain debt and other obligations, and (xix) sales or discounts of receivables.\nThe Credit Parties are subject to certain financial covenants under the Current Credit Facility, including, without limitation, tested on the last day of each fiscal quarter, (i) a maximum ratio of the Company's consolidated indebtedness (subject to certain exclusions) to adjusted EBITDAX of 4.00 to 1.00 and (ii) a current ratio, as defined in the agreement, inclusive of the unused Commitments then available to be borrowed, to not be less than 1.00 to 1.00.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had $50.0 million outstanding under the Current Credit Facility and had the ability to borrow up to the borrowing base of $350.0 million. For more information regarding our debt, please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 7 - Long-term Debt.\nAs of December 31, 2018, and through the filing date of this report, the Company is in compliance with all credit facility covenants.\nPrior Credit Facility\nOn April 7, 2017, the Company's Plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, and the Plan became effective on April 28, 2017. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we (i) executed a credit agreement (the Prior Credit Facility\u201d) with an initial borrowing base of $191.7 million and maturity date of March 31, 2021 and (ii) issued new common stock as part of the $200.0 million rights offering and the $7.5 million transaction with the ad hoc equity committee in the bankruptcy proceeding. Please refer to Note 15 - Chapter 11 Proceedings and Emergence for additional details.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have the following contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 261: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current Credit Facility(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and fees on Current Credit Facility(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Delivery commitments(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office lease(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>326,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________\nTable 262: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>No scheduled payments exist for the Current Credit Facility, and prepayments can be made without penalty, so long as payment is made on the last day of the interest period.

The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We provide expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies, estimates, and judgments below. We believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management.\nMethod of accounting for oil and natural gas properties\nOil and natural gas exploration and development activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized at cost when incurred, pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not find proved reserves, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense. The costs of development wells are capitalized whether\nproductive or nonproductive. All capitalized well costs and other associated costs and leasehold costs of proved properties are amortized on a unit-of-production basis over the remaining life of proved developed reserves and proved reserves, respectively.\nCosts of retired, sold, or abandoned properties that constitute a part of an amortization base (partial field) are charged or credited, net of proceeds, to accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization unless doing so significantly affects the unit-of-production amortization rate for an entire field, in which case a gain or loss is recognized currently. Gains or losses from the disposal of properties are recognized currently.\nExpenditures for maintenance, repairs, and minor renewals necessary to maintain properties in operating condition are expensed as incurred. Major betterments, replacements, and renewals are capitalized to the appropriate property and equipment accounts. Estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs for oil and natural gas properties are capitalized, net of salvage, at their estimated net present value and amortized on a unit-of-production basis over the remaining life of the related proved developed reserves.\nUnproved properties consist of costs incurred to acquire unproved leases, or lease acquisition costs. Unproved lease acquisition costs are capitalized until the leases expire or when we specifically identify leases that will revert to the lessor, at which time we expense the associated unproved lease acquisition costs. The expensing or expiration of unproved lease acquisition costs are recorded as abandonment or impairment of unproved properties in the statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated financial statements. Lease acquisition costs are reclassified to proved properties and depleted on a unit-of-production basis once proved reserves have been assigned.\nFor sales of entire working interests in unproved properties, gain or loss is recognized to the extent of the difference between the proceeds received and the net carrying value of the property. Proceeds from sales of partial interests in unproved properties are accounted for as a recovery of costs unless the proceeds exceed the entire cost of the property.\nOil and natural gas reserve quantities and Standardized Measure\nIn the current and prior year, our third-party petroleum consultant prepared our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues. During 2016, our internal corporate reservoir engineering group prepared, and our third-party petroleum engineering consultant audited our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues. While the SEC has adopted rules which allow us to disclose proved, probable, and possible reserves, we have elected to disclose only proved reserves in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The SEC's revised rules define proved reserves as the quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. Our internal corporate reservoir engineering group and our third party petroleum engineering consultant must make a number of subjective assumptions based on their professional judgment in developing reserve estimates. Reserve estimates are updated annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each field. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment.\nPeriodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of a number of factors, including reservoir performance, oil and natural gas prices, cost changes, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data, or other economic factors. Accordingly, reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. We cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserve revisions. If such revisions are significant, they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material.\nRevenue Recognition\nSales of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids are recognized when performance obligations are satisfied at the point control of the product is transferred to the customer. Virtually all of our contracts' pricing provisions are tied to a market index, with certain adjustments based on, among other factors, whether a well delivers to a gathering or transmission line, quality of the oil or natural gas, and prevailing supply and demand conditions. As a result, the price of the oil, natural gas, and NGLs fluctuates to remain competitive with other available oil, natural gas, and NGLs supplies. Please refer to Footnote 2 - Revenue Recognition for more information.\nThe Company records revenues, net of royalties, discounts, and allowances, as applicable, from the sales of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs when delivery to the customer has occurred and title has transferred. This occurs when oil or gas has been delivered to a pipeline or a tank lifting has occurred. At the end of each month, the Company estimates the amount of production delivered to the purchaser and the price the Company will receive. The Company factors in historical performance, quality and transportation differentials, commodity prices, and other factors when deriving revenue estimates. Payment is generally received within 30 to 90 days after the date of production. The Company has interests with other producers in certain properties, in which case the Company uses the entitlement method to account for gas imbalances. The Company had no material gas imbalances as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nImpairment of proved properties\nWe review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred and at least annually. We estimate the expected undiscounted future cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties and compare such undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and natural gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and natural gas properties to fair value. The factors used to determine fair value are subject to our judgment and expertise and include, but are not limited to, recent sales prices of comparable properties, the present value of future cash flows, net of estimated operating and development costs, using estimates of proved reserves, future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures, and various discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors, we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges for proved properties will be recorded.\nImpairment of unproved properties\nWe assess our unproved properties periodically for impairment on a property-by-property basis based on remaining lease terms, drilling results, or future plans to develop acreage and record abandonment and impairment expense for any decline in value. Leases that were not held by production upon emergence from bankruptcy are being amortized over the remainder of those leases.\nWe have historically recognized abandonment and impairment expense for unproved properties at the time when the lease term has expired or sooner if, in management's judgment, the unproved properties have lost some or all of their carrying value. We consider the following factors in our assessment of the impairment of unproved properties:\nTable 266: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the remaining amount of unexpired term under our leases;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 267: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to actively manage and prioritize our capital expenditures to drill leases and to make payments to extend leases that may be closer to expiration;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 268: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to exchange lease positions with other companies that allow for higher concentrations of ownership and development;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 269: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to convey partial mineral ownership to other companies in exchange for their drilling of leases; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 270: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our evaluation of the continuing successful results from the application of completion technology in the Wattenberg Field by us or by other operators in areas adjacent to or near our unproved properties.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe assessment of unproved properties to determine any possible impairment requires significant judgment.\nAsset retirement obligations\nWe record the fair value of a liability for a legal obligation to retire an asset in the period in which the liability is incurred with the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. For oil and gas properties, this is the period in which the well is drilled or acquired. The asset retirement obligation ( ARO\u201d) for oil and gas properties represents the estimated amount we will incur to plug, abandon, and remediate the properties at the end of their productive lives, in accordance with applicable state laws. The liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated on the unit-of-production method. The accretion expense is recorded as a component of depreciation, depletion, and amortization in our accompanying statements of operations.\nWe determine the ARO by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability. Estimating the future ARO requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding timing, existence of a liability, as well as what constitutes adequate restoration. Inherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate costs, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental, and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the related asset.\nDerivatives\nWe record all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their estimated fair value. We have not designated any derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes, and we do not enter into such instruments for speculative trading purposes. Derivative instruments are adjusted to fair value every accounting period. Derivative cash settlements and gains and losses from valuation changes in the remaining unsettled commodity derivative instruments are reported under derivative gain (loss) in our accompanying statements of operations.\nStock-based compensation\nRestricted Stock Units. We recognize compensation expense for all restricted stock units granted to employees and directors. Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The fair value of restricted stock grants is based on the value of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense recorded for restricted stock units is included in general and administrative expenses on our accompanying statements of operations.\nStock Options. We recognize compensation expense for all stock option awards granted to employees. Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The fair value of stock option grants is based on a Black-Scholes Model. Stock-based compensation expense recorded for stock option awards is included in general and administrative expenses on our accompanying statements of operations.\nPerformance Stock Units. We recognize compensation expense for all performance stock unit awards granted to employees. The number of shares of the Company's common stock that may be issued to settle PSUs range from zero to two times the number of PSUs awarded. The PSUs vest in their entirety at the end of the three-year performance period. The total number of PSUs granted is evenly split between two performance criteria. The first criterion is based on a comparison of the Company's absolute and relative total shareholder return ( TSR\u201d) for the performance period compared with the TSRs of a group of peer companies for the same performance period. The TSR for the Company and each of the peer companies is determined by dividing (A)(i) the volume-weighted average share price for the last 30 trading days of the performance period, minus (ii) the volume-weighted average share price for the 30 trading days preceding the beginning of the performance period, by (B) the volume-weighted average share price for the 30 trading days preceding the beginning of the performance period. The second criterion is based on the Company's average annual return on capital employed ( ROCE\u201d) for each year during the three-year performance period. Compensation expense associated with PSUs is recognized as general and administrative expense over the performance period.\nThe fair value of the PSUs is measured at the grant date with a stochastic process method using a Brownian Motion simulation. A stochastic process is a mathematically defined equation that can create a series of outcomes over time. These outcomes are not deterministic in nature, which means that by iterating the equations multiple times, different results will be obtained for those iterations. In the case of the Company's PSUs, the Company could not predict with certainty the path its stock price or the stock prices of its peers would take over the performance period. By using a stochastic simulation, the Company created multiple prospective stock pathways, statistically analyzed these simulations, and ultimately made inferences\nregarding the most likely path the stock price would take. As such, because future stock prices are stochastic, or probabilistic with some direction in nature, the stochastic method, specifically the Brownian Motion Model, was deemed an appropriate method by which to determine the fair value of the portion of the PSUs tied to the TSR. Significant assumptions used in this simulation include the Company's expected volatility, risk-free interest rate based on U.S. Treasury yield curve rates with maturities consistent with the performance period, as well as the volatilities for each of the Company's peers.\nIncome taxes\nOur provision for taxes includes both federal and state taxes. We record our federal income taxes in accordance with accounting for income taxes under GAAP which results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance would be established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.\nWe apply significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and estimating our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The actual outcome of these future tax consequences could differ significantly from our estimates, which could impact our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe also account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with GAAP by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires that we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. We did not have any uncertain tax positions as of the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nPlease refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional details.\nEffects of Inflation and Pricing\nInflation in the United States increased to 2.2% in 2018 from 1.8% in 2017, which was a decrease from 2.0% in 2016. These changes did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the periods ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. Although the impact of inflation has been relatively insignificant in recent years, it is still a factor in the United States economy, and we tend to experience inflationary pressure on the cost of oilfield services and equipment as increasing oil and gas prices increase drilling activity in our areas of operations. Material changes in prices also impact the current revenue stream, estimates of future reserves, borrowing base calculations, depletion expense, impairment assessments of oil and gas properties, ARO, and values of properties in purchase and sale transactions. Material changes in prices can impact the value of oil and gas companies and their ability to raise capital, borrow money, and retain personnel.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCurrently, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.", "summary": "The report explains the financial and operational results of an independent Denver-based exploration and production company focused on the extraction of oil and natural gas in the United States.

The drilling and completion portion of the budget is expected to be approximately $210.0 million to $220.0 million, which will support drilling 59 gross wells and turning to sales 45 gross wells. Included in the drilling completion budget is $15.0 million for non-operated capital. Of the wells planned to be completed, 16 are XRL wells, five are MRL wells, and 24 are SRL wells. The remaining 2019 capital budget of $20.0 million to $35.0 million is to support infrastructure and leasehold costs. Actual capital expenditures could vary significantly based on, among other things, market conditions, commodity prices, drilling and completion costs, well results, and changes in the borrowing base under our Current Credit Facility.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Comparative results of operations for the period indicated are discussed below.\nThe Company conducted standard business operations throughout the bankruptcy proceedings and during the application of fresh-start accounting, resulting in specific financial statement line items following normal course of business trends. The trends associated with the non-impacted financial statement line items are explained throughout the results of operations and include revenues, lease operating expense, gas plant and midstream operating expense, severance and ad valorem taxes, and exploration expense. The financial statement line items that were specifically impacted by the bankruptcy proceedings and application of fresh-start accounting are discussed within the confines of the presented periods and include depreciation, depletion, and amortization, general and administrative expense, interest expense, and reorganization items, net.\nReferences to Successor\u201d or Successor Company\u201d relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to April 28, 2017. References to Predecessor\u201d or Predecessor Company\u201d relate to the financial position and results of operations of the Company on or prior to April 28, 2017. Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis, the Company refers to the 2017 annual period which is comprised of both Successor and Predecessor periods. References to Current Successor Period\u201d relate to the year ended December 31, 2018. References to 2017 Successor Period\u201d relate to the period of April 29, 2017 through December 31, 2018. References to the 2017 Predecessor Period\u201d and 2016 Predecessor Period\u201d relate to the periods of January 1, 2017 through April 28, 2017 and January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, respectively. For additional information about our bankruptcy proceedings and emergence, please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 15 - Chapter 11. For additional information about our application of fresh-start accounting, please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 16 - Fresh-Start Accounting.\nThe table below presents revenues, sales volumes, and average sales prices for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per Boe amounts):\n\n_____________________________\n (1) Crude oil sales excludes $0.6 million, $0.2 million, and $0.1 million of oil transportation revenues from third parties, which do not have associated sales volumes, for the Current Successor Period, 2017 Successor Period, and the 2017 Predecessor Period, respectively. \n (2) Natural gas sales excludes $1.3 million, $0.8 million, and $0.4 million of gas gathering revenues from third parties, which do not have associated sales volumes, for the Current Successor Period, 2017 Successor Period, and the 2017 Predecessor Period, respectively. \n (3) Determined using the ratio of 6 Mcf of natural gas to 1 Bbl of crude oil. \n (4) The derivatives economically hedge the price we receive for crude oil. For the Current Successor Period, the derivative cash settlement loss for oil and natural gas was $17.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively, and the derivative cash settlement loss for oil was $1.5 million for the 2017 Successor Period. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 13 - Derivatives for additional disclosures.  Operating revenues increased by 44% to $274.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $190.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 largely due to a 31% increase in oil equivalent pricing and a 10% increase in sales volumes. The increased volumes are a direct result of the Company increasing the pace and efficiency of its Wattenberg development program during 2018. During the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, we turned to sales 34.4 net operated wells in the Rocky Mountain region. In addition to the overall increase of operational activity, there was an increase of $9.7 million related to the adoption of ASC 606, which caused certain revenues to be presented on a gross basis compared to a historical net presentation. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 2 - Revenue Recognition for additional disclosures.\nThe following table summarizes our operating expenses for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per Boe amounts):\n\nLease operating expense. Our lease operating expense decreased $4.2 million or 11%, to $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from the combined 2017 Successor and Predecessor Periods of $39.0 million, and decreased on an equivalent basis to $5.43 per Boe from $6.68 per Boe. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of our Mid-Continent assets on August 6, 2018. The Company has also taken measures to decrease its lease operating expense, in conjunction with an increase in production, which caused the per Boe metric to further decrease. During 2018, the Company experienced decreases in its well servicing and maintenance costs of $3.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\nGas plant and midstream operating expense. Our gas plant and midstream operating expense decreased $1.1 million to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $11.9 million for the combined 2017 Successor and Predecessor Periods, and decreased on an equivalent basis to $1.68 per Boe from $2.04 per Boe. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of our Mid-Continent assets on August 6, 2018.\nGathering, transportation, and processing. As noted in the operating revenues section above, the increase in gathering, transportation, and processing expense during the year ended December 31, 2018 to $9.7 million is related to the Company's adoption of ASC 606 during 2018, which caused certain revenues to be shown gross, with the related expenses recorded in this line item. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 2 - Revenue Recognition for additional disclosures.\nSeverance and ad valorem taxes. Our severance and ad valorem taxes increased by 24% from $15.3 million for the combined 2017 Successor and Predecessor Periods to $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Severance and ad valorem taxes primarily correlate to revenue. Revenues increased by 44% for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017. The Company received a net ad valorem tax settlement of $5.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2018, which reduced this line item. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional discussion on the settlement.\nExploration. Our exploration expense decreased $7.1 million to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $7.4 million for the combined 2017 Successor and Predecessor Periods. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred $0.3 million in delay rentals. During the combined 2017 Successor and Predecessor Periods, we paid $3.8 million in delay rentals and incurred $2.9 million on abandoned well projects and $0.7 million in geological and geophysical expenses.\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization. Our depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense per Boe was $6.53, $5.66, and $13.54 for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 Successor Period, and 2017 Predecessor Period, respectively. Together, the year ended December 31, 2018 and the 2017 Successor Period (collectively, the Successor Periods\u201d) reflect the $310.6 million fair value downward adjustment to the depletable asset base upon adoption of fresh-start accounting. The increase in depreciation, depletion, and amortization during the Current Successor Period when compared to the 2017 Successor Period primarily correlates to an increase in capital expenditures.\nAbandonment and impairment of unproved properties. During the year ended December 31, 2018, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties of $5.3 million was due to the standard annual amortization of our emergence leases that were not held by production at the time of our emergence. There were no abandonment and impairment of unproved properties during the 2017 Successor and Predecessor Periods. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional discussion on our impairment policy and practices.\nUnused commitments. There were immaterial amounts of unused commitments during the year ended December 31, 2018. No amounts of unused commitments were incurred during the 2017 Successor Period. During the 2017 Predecessor Period, we incurred $1.0 million in unused commitment fees on a water supply contract in the Wattenberg Field.\nGeneral and administrative expense. Our general and administrative expense per Boe was $6.62, $11.34, and $7.28 for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 Successor Period, and 2017 Predecessor Period, respectively. The 2017 Successor Period reflects a one-time cash and non-cash $9.6 million, or $2.55 per Boe, severance charge primarily related to the Company's former Chief Executive Officer's separation from the Company. The remaining decrease in expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the combined 2017 Successor and Predecessor Periods was due to decreases in consultant restructuring fees of $5.4 million and wages and benefits of $2.7 million, partially offset by increases in employee bonuses of $1.6 million and professional services of $0.8 million.\nDerivative gain (loss). Our derivative gain for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $30.3 million as compared to a loss of $15.4 million for the 2017 Successor Period. We had no derivative contracts during the 2017 Predecessor Period. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into several oil and gas costless collars, puts, and swap contracts. Our derivative gain is primarily due to fair market value adjustments caused by market prices being lower than our contracted hedge prices. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 13 - Derivatives for additional discussion.\nInterest expense. Our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, the 2017 Successor Period, and the 2017 Predecessor Period was $2.6 million, $0.8 million, and $5.7 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred $1.4 million in interest expense associated with its Current and Prior Credit Facilities, commitment fees of $0.9 million, and miscellaneous fees of $0.3 million related to its Current and Prior Credit Facilities. The Company incurred $0.7 million in commitment fees on the available borrowing base under the Prior Credit Facility during the 2017 Successor Period. Interest expense on the Company's Senior Notes was $1.0 million for the 2017 Predecessor Period, with the remaining interest expense relating to the predecessor credit facility. The Company had no outstanding debt during the 2017 Successor Period. Average debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the 2017 Predecessor Period was $26.8 million and $991.7 million, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe table below presents revenues, sales volumes, and average sales prices for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per Boe amounts):\n\n________________________________\n (1) Crude oil sales excludes $0.2 million, $0.1 million, and $0.5 million of oil transportation revenues from third parties, which do not have associated sales volumes, for the 2017 Successor Period, 2017 Predecessor Period, and the 2016 Predecessor Period, respectively. \n (2) Natural gas sales excludes $0.8 million, $0.4 million, and $1.5 million of gas gathering revenues from third parties, which do not have associated sales volumes, for the 2017 Successor Period, 2017 Predecessor Period, and the 2016 Predecessor Period, respectively. \n (3) Determined using the ratio of 6 Mcf of natural gas to 1 Bbl of crude oil. \n (4) The derivatives economically hedge the price we receive for crude oil. For the 2017 Successor Period, the derivative cash settlement loss was $1.5 million and the derivative cash settlement gain was $18.3 million for the 2016 Predecessor Period. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 13 - Derivatives for additional disclosures. \nOperating revenues decreased by 1% to $190.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $193.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, largely due to a 26% decrease in sales volumes offset by a 34% increase in oil equivalent pricing. The decreased volumes were a direct result of the Company suspending drilling and completion activities through the majority of 2016 and the first half of 2017. During the period from December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2017, we turned to sales 10.0 net operated wells in the Rocky Mountain region and no wells in the Mid-Continent region.\nThe following table summarizes our operating expenses for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per Boe amounts):\n\nLease operating expense. Our lease operating expense decreased $4.7 million or 11%, to $39.0 million for the 2017 Successor and 2017 Predecessor Periods from $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, but increased on an equivalent basis from $5.50 per Boe to $6.68 per Boe due to reduced production. The Company eliminated significant amounts of compression and labor costs resulting in a decrease in total compression costs of $4.1 million for the 2017 Successor and Predecessor Period when compared to the same period in 2016.\nGas plant and midstream operating expense. Our gas plant and midstream operating expense decreased $0.9 million to $11.9 million for the 2017 Successor and 2017 Predecessor Period from $12.8 million for the 2016 Predecessor Period, but increased on an equivalent basis from $1.62 per Boe to $2.04 per Boe due to reduced production. Gas plant and midstream operating expense on an aggregate basis was commensurate between the comparable periods.\nSeverance and ad valorem taxes. Our severance and ad valorem taxes remained constant between the 2017 Successor and 2017 Period and the 2016 Predecessor Period. Severance and ad valorem taxes primarily correlate to revenue. Revenues decreased by 1% for the 2017 Successor and 2017 Predecessor Period when compared to the same period in 2016.\nExploration. Our exploration expense increased $6.5 million to $7.4 million for the 2017 Successor and 2017 Predecessor Period from $0.9 million for the comparable period in 2016. During the 2017 Successor and 2017 Predecessor Period we paid $3.8 million in delay rentals and incurred $2.9 million on abandoned well projects and $0.7 million in geological and geophysical expenses. During the 2016 Predecessor Period, we incurred $0.9 million on abandoned well projects.\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization. Our depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense per Boe was $5.66, $13.54, and $14.01 for the 2017 Successor Period, 2017 Predecessor Period, and 2016 Predecessor Period, respectively. The 2017 Successor Period reflects the $310.6 million fair value downward adjustment to the depletable asset base upon adoption of fresh-start accounting.\nImpairment of oil and gas properties. There were no impairment of oil and gas properties during the 2017 Successor and 2017 Predecessor Periods. During the 2016 Predecessor Period, we incurred a $10.0 million impairment charge on our Mid-Continent assets based on the most current bid for the assets received during the first quarter of 2016, when they were held for sale.

and $0.1 million of oil transportation revenues from third parties, which do not have associated sales volumes, for the Current Successor Period, 2017 Successor Period, and the 2017 Predecessor Period, respectively. \n (2) Natural gas sales excludes $1.3 million, $0.8 million, and $0.4 million of gas gathering revenues from third parties, which do not have associated sales volumes, for the Current Successor Period, 2017 Successor Period, and the 2017 Predecessor Period, respectively. \n (3) Determined using the ratio of 6 Mcf of natural gas to 1 Bbl of crude oil. \n (4) The derivatives economically hedge the price we receive for crude oil. For the Current Successor Period, the derivative cash settlement loss for oil and natural gas was $17.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively, and the derivative cash settlement loss for oil was $1.5 million for the 2017 Successor Period. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 13 - Derivatives for additional disclosures.  Operating revenues increased by 44% to $274.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $190.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 largely due to a 31% increase in oil equivalent pricing and a 10% increase in sales volumes. The increased volumes are a direct result of the Company increasing the pace and efficiency of its Wattenberg development program during 2018. During the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, we turned to sales 34.4 net operated wells in the Rocky Mountain region. In addition to the overall increase of operational activity, there was an increase of $9.7 million related to the adoption of ASC 606, which caused certain revenues to be presented on a gross basis compared to a historical net presentation.

Our lease operating expense decreased $4.2 million or 11%, to $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from the combined 2017 Successor and Predecessor Periods of $39.0 million, and decreased on an equivalent basis to $5.43 per Boe from $6.68 per Boe. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of our Mid-Continent assets on August 6, 2018. The Company has also taken measures to decrease its lease operating expense, in conjunction with an increase in production, which caused the per Boe metric to further decrease. During 2018, the Company experienced decreases in its well servicing and maintenance costs of $3.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\nGas plant and midstream operating expense. Our gas plant and midstream operating expense decreased $1.1 million to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $11.9 million for the combined 2017 Successor and Predecessor Periods, and decreased on an equivalent basis to $1.68 per Boe from $2.04 per Boe. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of our Mid-Continent assets on August 6, 2018.\nGathering, transportation, and processing. As noted in the operating revenues section above, the increase in gathering, transportation, and processing expense during the year ended December 31, 2018 to $9.7 million is related to the Company's adoption of ASC 606 during 2018, which caused certain revenues to be shown gross, with the related expenses recorded in this line item. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 2 - Revenue Recognition for additional disclosures.\nSeverance and ad valorem taxes. Our severance and ad valorem taxes increased by 24% from $15.3 million for the combined 2017 Successor and Predecessor Periods to $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Severance and ad valorem taxes primarily correlate to revenue. Revenues increased by 44% for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017. The Company received a net ad valorem tax settlement of $5.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2018, which reduced this line item. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional discussion on the settlement.\nExploration. Our exploration expense decreased $7.1 million to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $7.4 million for the combined 2017 Successor and Predecessor Periods. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred $0.3 million in delay rentals. During the combined 2017 Successor and Predecessor Periods, we paid $3.8 million in delay rentals and incurred $2.9 million on abandoned well projects and $0.7 million in geological and geophysical expenses.\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization. Our depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense per Boe was $6.53, $5.66, and $13.54 for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 Successor Period, and 2017 Predecessor Period, respectively. Together, the year ended December 31, 2018 and the 2017 Successor Period (collectively, the Successor Periods\u201d) reflect the $310.6 million fair value downward adjustment to the depletable asset base upon adoption of fresh-start accounting. The increase in depreciation, depletion, and amortization during the Current Successor Period when compared to the 2017 Successor Period primarily correlates to an increase in capital expenditures.\nAbandonment and impairment of unproved properties. During the year ended December 31, 2018, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties of $5.3 million was due to the standard annual amortization of our emergence leases that were not held by production at the time of our emergence. There were no abandonment and impairment of unproved properties during the 2017 Successor and Predecessor Periods. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional discussion on our impairment policy and practices.\nUnused commitments. There were immaterial amounts of unused commitments during the year ended December 31, 2018. No amounts of unused commitments were incurred during the 2017 Successor Period. During the 2017 Predecessor Period, we incurred $1.0 million in unused commitment fees on a water supply contract in the Wattenberg Field.\nGeneral and administrative expense. Our general and administrative expense per Boe was $6.62, $11.34, and $7.28 for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 Successor Period, and 2017 Predecessor Period, respectively. The 2017 Successor Period reflects a one-time cash and non-cash $9.6 million, or $2.55 per Boe, severance charge primarily related to the Company's former Chief Executive Officer's separation from the Company. The remaining decrease in expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the combined 2017 Successor and Predecessor Periods was due to decreases in consultant restructuring fees of $5.4 million and wages and benefits of $2.7 million, partially offset by increases in employee bonuses of $1.6 million and professional services of $0.8 million.\nDerivative gain (loss). Our derivative gain for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $30.3 million as compared to a loss of $15.4 million for the 2017 Successor Period. We had no derivative contracts during the 2017 Predecessor Period. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into several oil and gas costless collars, puts, and swap contracts. Our derivative gain is primarily due to fair market value adjustments caused by market prices being lower than our contracted hedge prices. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 13 - Derivatives for additional discussion.\nInterest expense. Our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, the 2017 Successor Period, and the 2017 Predecessor Period was $2.6 million, $0.8 million, and $5.7 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred $1.4 million in interest expense associated with its Current and Prior Credit Facilities, commitment fees of $0.9 million, and miscellaneous fees of $0.3 million related to its Current and Prior Credit Facilities. The Company incurred $0.7 million in commitment fees on the available borrowing base under the Prior Credit Facility during the 2017 Successor Period. Interest expense on the Company's Senior Notes was $1.0 million for the 2017 Predecessor Period, with the remaining interest expense relating to the predecessor credit facility. The Company had no outstanding debt during the 2017 Successor Period. Average debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the 2017 Predecessor Period was $26.8 million and $991.7 million, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended

transportation revenues from third parties, which do not have associated sales volumes, for the 2017 Successor Period, 2017 Predecessor Period, and the 2016 Predecessor Period, respectively. \n (2) Natural gas sales excludes $0.8 million, $0.4 million, and $1.5 million of gas gathering revenues from third parties, which do not have associated sales volumes, for the 2017 Successor Period, 2017 Predecessor Period, and the 2016 Predecessor Period, respectively. \n (3) Determined using the ratio of 6 Mcf of natural gas to 1 Bbl of crude oil. \n (4) The derivatives economically hedge the price we receive for crude oil. For the 2017 Successor Period, the derivative cash settlement loss was $1.5 million and the derivative cash settlement gain was $18.3 million for the 2016 Predecessor Period. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 13 - Derivatives for additional disclosures. \nOperating revenues decreased by 1% to $190.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $193.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, largely due to a 26% decrease in sales volumes offset by a 34% increase in oil equivalent pricing. The decreased volumes were a direct result of the Company suspending drilling and completion activities through the majority of 2016 and the first half of 2017. During the period from December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2017, we turned to sales 10.0 net operated wells in the Rocky Mountain region and no wells in the Mid-Continent region.\nThe following

Our lease operating expense decreased $4.7 million or 11%, to $39.0 million for the 2017 Successor and 2017 Predecessor Periods from $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, but increased on an equivalent basis from $5.50 per Boe to $6.68 per Boe due to reduced production. The Company eliminated significant amounts of compression and labor costs resulting in a decrease in total compression costs of $4.1 million for the 2017 Successor and Predecessor Period when compared to the same period in 2016.\nGas plant and midstream operating expense. Our gas plant and midstream operating expense decreased $0.9 million to $11.9 million for the 2017 Successor and 2017 Predecessor Period from $12.8 million for the 2016 Predecessor Period, but increased on an equivalent basis from $1.62 per Boe to $2.04 per Boe due to reduced production. Gas plant and midstream operating expense on an aggregate basis was commensurate between the comparable periods.\nSeverance and ad valorem taxes. Our severance and ad valorem taxes remained constant between the 2017 Successor and 2017 Period and the 2016 Predecessor Period. Severance and ad valorem taxes primarily correlate to revenue. Revenues decreased by 1% for the 2017 Successor and 2017 Predecessor Period when compared to the same period in 2016.\nExploration. Our exploration expense increased $6.5 million to $7.4 million for the 2017 Successor and 2017 Predecessor Period from $0.9 million for the comparable period in 2016. During the 2017 Successor and 2017 Predecessor Period we paid $3.8 million in delay rentals and incurred $2.9 million on abandoned well projects and $0.7 million in geological and geophysical expenses. During the 2016 Predecessor Period, we incurred $0.9 million on abandoned well projects.\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization. Our depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense per Boe was $5.66, $13.54, and $14.01 for the 2017 Successor Period, 2017 Predecessor Period, and 2016 Predecessor Period, respectively. The 2017 Successor Period reflects the $310.6 million fair value downward adjustment to the depletable asset base upon adoption of fresh-start accounting.\nImpairment of oil and gas properties. There were no impairment of oil and gas properties during the 2017 Successor and 2017 Predecessor Periods. During the 2016 Predecessor Period, we incurred a $10.0 million impairment charge on our Mid-Continent assets based on the most current bid for the assets received during the first quarter of 2016, when they were held for sale.
