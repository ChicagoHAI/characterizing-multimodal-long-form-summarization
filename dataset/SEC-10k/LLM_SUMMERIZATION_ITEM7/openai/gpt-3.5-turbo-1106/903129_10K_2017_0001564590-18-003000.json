Further, you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. See also Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in Item 1 of this Report.\nOverview\nGentherm Incorporated is a global technology and industry leader in the design, development, and manufacturing of innovative thermal management technologies. Our products provide solutions for automotive passenger comfort and convenience, battery thermal management, remote power generation, patient temperature management, environmental product testing and other consumer and industrial temperature control needs. Our automotive products can be found on the vehicles of nearly all major automotive manufacturers operating in North America, Europe and Asia. We operate in locations aligned with our major customers' product strategies in order to provide locally enhanced design, integration and production capabilities and to identify future thermal technology product opportunities in both automotive and other markets. We concentrate our research on the development of new technologies and new applications from existing technologies to create product and market opportunities for a wide array of thermal management solutions.\nEtratech\nOn November 1, 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the operating liabilities of Etratech Inc., an Ontario corporation and all of the outstanding shares of Etratech Hong Kong, an entity organized under the laws of Hong Kong, in an all-cash transaction. Etratech manufactures advanced electronic controls and control systems for the automotive, RV and marine, security, medical and other industries. Etratech's world headquarters and North American manufacturing operations are located in Burlington, Canada. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisition of Etratech.\nCincinnati Sub-Zero\nOn April 1, 2016, we acquired all of the equity of privately-held CSZ and related assets in an all-cash transaction. CSZ manufactures both high quality patient temperature management systems for the health care industry and custom testing equipment used by a wide range of industrial manufacturing companies for product testing. CSZ's world headquarters and manufacturing operations are located in Cincinnati, Ohio. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisition of CSZ.\nNorth American Reorganization\nOn January 4, 2016 and January 5, 2016, the Company completed reorganization transactions (the Reorganization\u201d) related to our North American business (the Windsor Operations\u201d). As part of our original integration plan to eliminate redundancies associated with the 2011 acquisition of Gentherm GmbH (formerly named W.E.T. Automotive Systems AG), the Windsor Operations have been consolidated into our existing European and North American facilities. As a result of the Reorganization, some of the business activities previously performed by the Windsor Operations are now being performed by other subsidiaries.\nRelated to the Reorganization, the Company declared intercompany dividends, incurred and paid withholding taxes to the Canadian Revenue Agency of $7,600,000 during 2016. Additionally, the Company incurred income tax expense of $2,500,000 related to the intercompany dividends. These amounts incurred are expected to cover all future intercompany dividends needed to distribute the remaining earnings of the subsidiary to its parent in conjunction with the potential future liquidation of the subsidiary.\nIn addition to the $7,600,000 of withholding tax and $2,500,000 of income taxes, the Reorganization required the Company to make a one-time income tax payment of approximately $32,600,000. The one-time income tax payment was accrued during the first quarter of 2016; however, the Company also recorded an offsetting deferred charge for approximately the same amount because the one-time income tax payment will result in tax deductions against income taxes in future periods. Therefore, the income tax payment did not have a material impact on the Company's earnings during the first quarter of 2016 nor any subsequent quarter. The withholding tax payment was paid entirely in 2016. The income tax payments of $2,500,000 and $32,600,000 that were included in the accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2016, were paid during the first half of 2017.\nReportable Segments\nThe Company has two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: Automotive and Industrial. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our reportable segments as well as their proportional contribution to the Company's reported product revenues and operating income. The financial information used by our chief operating decision maker to assess operating performance and allocate resources is based on these reportable segments.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Product revenues;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Warranty reserves;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Litigation reserves;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Allowances for doubtful accounts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Income taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Inventory reserves;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Stock compensation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Pension plans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct Revenues\nThe Company sells its products under long term supply or purchase order contracts issued by its customers. These contracts involve the sale of goods and services at fixed prices and provide for related transfer of ownership risk to the customer upon shipment from the Company's warehouse location or in some cases upon receipt of the goods at the customer's facility, or completion of services. Shipping and handling costs are recognized in cost of sales. With only a few minor exceptions, payment terms for these contracts range from 30 to 120 days from the date of shipment. Cash discounts for early payment are only extended to customer purchases recognized within the Industrial reporting segment. Unless a payment is for a distinct good or service, any consideration paid to a customer is recognized directly against the revenue earned from that customer.\nFor construction-type contract revenues recognized in our Industrial segment, the completed-contract method is used to determine revenue and the cost of earned revenue. The transfer of ownership upon shipment is used to determine substantial completion and the recognition of revenue for these construction-type contracts.\nAccrued Warranty Costs\nThe Company accrues warranty obligations for products sold based on management estimates of future failure rates and current claim cost experience, with support from the sales, engineering, quality and legal functions. While we believe our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate, such estimates could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future. The warranty policy is reviewed by management annually. Using historical information available to the Company, including claims already filed by customers, the warranty accrual is adjusted quarterly to reflect management's best estimate of future claims.\nLitigation Reserves\nWe record estimated future costs related to new or ongoing litigation based on input from legal counsel and our best estimate of potential loss. These estimates include costs associated with attorney fees and potential claims and assessments less any amounts we anticipate are recoverable under insurance policies. Final resolution of the litigation contingencies could result in amounts different from current accruals and, therefore, have an impact on our consolidated financial results in future reporting periods.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe record an allowance for doubtful accounts once exposure to collection risk of an accounts receivable is specifically identified. We analyze the length of time an account receivable is outstanding, as well as a customer's payment history to determine the need for and amount of an allowance for doubtful accounts.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record income tax expense using the liability method which specifies that deferred tax assets and liabilities be measured each year based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when management considers it more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, a valuation allowance has been provided for certain deferred tax assets which we have concluded are more likely than not to not be realized. If future annual taxable income were to be significantly less than current and projected levels, there is a risk that certain of our deferred tax assets not already provided for by the valuation allowance would expire prior to utilization.\nWe recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount\nrecognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.\nInventory Reserves\nWe recognize a reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventories based on estimates of future sales and an inventory item's capacity to be repurposed for a different use. We consider the number of months supply on hand based on current planned requirements, uncommitted future projections and historical usage in estimating the inventory reserve. Additional provisions are made for supplier claims for obsolete materials, prototype inventory, spare or customer service inventory and, for all periods other than at year-end, estimates for physical inventory adjustments.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe account for grants of employee stock options and restricted stock as compensation expense based upon the fair value on the date of grant and such expense is recognized over the vesting period. We determine fair value of awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporates certain assumptions, such as expected volatility, expected life of options, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield, in order to arrive at a fair value estimate. Expected volatilities are based on the average of the historical volatility of the Company's Common Stock and that of an index of companies in our industry group. To evaluate our assumptions for the expected lives of options, we consider the average holding period of previously exercised options and the remaining terms of outstanding options. The risk free interest rate is based upon quoted market yields for United States Treasury debt securities. The expected dividend yield is based upon the Company's history of having never issued a dividend, the limitations to issue a dividend under the Amended Credit Agreement and management's current expectation regarding future dividends. We believe that the assumptions selected by management are reasonable; however, significant changes could materially impact the results of the calculation of fair value.\nPension Plans\nThe Company's obligations and expenses for its pension plans are substantially dependent on the Company's selection of discount rate and, for the Gentherm GmbH Plan, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions used by actuaries to calculate these amounts. Actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and amortized over future periods and generally affect recognized expense in future periods. As such, assumptions used to calculate benefit obligations as of the annual measurement date directly impact the expense to be recognized in future periods. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the pension plans, including their impact to Gentherm's financial statements.\nResults of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nProduct Revenues. Product revenues for 2017 were $985,683,000 compared with product revenues of $917,600,000 for 2016, an increase of $68,083,000, or 7.4%. This increase included the full year effect of the 2016 acquisition of CSZ, which operated as a part of Gentherm for a full year in 2017 but only for nine months during 2016, $8,398,000 in additional revenue attributable to the 2017 acquisition of Etratech after it was acquired on November 1, 2017, and a $4,995,000 favorable impact of foreign currency translation. Adjusting for these effects, our pro-forma product revenue growth was 4.6% and included a 2.7% increase in Automotive segment product revenues to $879,457,000 and a 23.4% increase in Industrial segment product revenue to 106,226,000.\nThe increase in the Automotive segment occurred despite lower global automotive production volumes and a special rebate of $2,000,000 recorded during 2017. The increases included higher revenue volume for seat heaters, totaling $18,370,000, or 6.4%, steering wheel heaters of $12,609,000, or 25.5%, automotive cable systems of $6,810,000, or 8.0%, and battery thermal management products of $3,497,000, or 53.4%. These higher amounts were attributable to new program awards, higher vehicle application rates and higher component content. Higher component content in seat heaters, for example, included a greater number of programs for which Gentherm provides the electronic controlling device along with the heating element. These increases were partially offset by lower Climate Controlled Seats ( CCS\u201d) product revenues which decreased by $17,834,000 or 4.4%. CCS product revenue was disproportionately impacted by the lower global production volumes which were more unfavorable in our primary CCS market, North America, which was down by 4%, compared to an increase of 2% for the global automotive industry. CCS revenues were also reduced as a result of certain vehicle programs changing technologies from the higher priced active cooling seat application to the lower priced heated and ventilated seat technology.\nProduct revenues from Global Power Technologies ( GPT\u201d) totaled $31,891,000 which represented an increase of $13,263,000, or 71%. Continuing market weakness in North America was more than offset by higher sales to other markets. Product sales in this business unit are typically large custom remote power systems having long lead times and, during 2017, there were more shipments than in the prior year. During 2016, demand for GPT's products sold in North America was unfavorably impacted by lower oil prices. While we do not generally sell our products for oil exploration, production or transportation activities, the impact of lower oil prices reduced capital investments for the natural gas industry being made by GPT's principal customers. As a result, those customers curtailed orders during that year.\nCSZ product revenue increased by $22,791,000 which included both an acquisition related increase of $15,905,000 and organic growth of $6,886,000, or 10%. This increase included higher revenue of environmental chamber products totaling $8,106,000 or 22% partially offset by lower revenue of patient temperature management products of $1,220,000 or 3.9%. The higher revenue for environmental chambers included several large custom orders as well as stronger demand for standard chambers. Patient temperature management product revenue equally benefited 2017 and 2016 from a temporary surge in demand for the Hemotherm product, a blood heater cooler used in hospital operating rooms during open heart surgery, but did not yet show improvements associated with a transition to a direct sales force that occurred throughout 2017.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales increased to $674,570,000 in 2017 from $622,563,000 in 2016. The increase of $52,007,000, or 8%, was due to increased sales volume, unfavorable inventory adjustments, other increased expenses and changes in product mix partially offset by a one-time $3,973,000 expense from the purchase accounting effect of inventory for the CSZ acquisition which occurred in 2016. The gross margin rate was 31.6% during 2017 representing a decrease of 60 basis points as compared with the 2016 gross margin rate of 32.2%. This decrease was due to the special rebate and the inventory adjustments and the higher expenses. The unfavorable inventory adjustments totaled $2,307,000 and were mainly comprised of a reserve recorded for inventory held for the heated and cooled mattress product line based upon a reduced sales outlook. Increased expenses totaling approximately $7,000,000 included higher fixed costs associated with our new manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Macedonia, labor expense inflation at our Ukraine factory, and factory launch expenses for the new advanced battery thermal management product and electronics.\nNet Research and Development Expenses. Net research and development expenses were $82,478,000 during 2017 compared to $72,923,000 in 2016, an increase of $9,555,000, or 13%. This increase was primarily driven by higher costs for additional resources, including personnel focused on application engineering for new production programs of existing products, development of new products and a program to develop the next generation of seat comfort products. New product development includes automotive cooled storage devices, automotive interior thermal management devices, medical thermal management devices, battery thermal management devices, battery management systems, advanced automotive electronics solutions and other potential products.\nIncreases in research and development were partially offset by research and development reimbursement totaling $12,037,000 during 2017 and $6,660,000 during 2016. We classify development and prototype costs and related reimbursements as research and development. This is consistent with accounting standards applied in the automotive industry. Depreciation costs for tooling are included in cost of sales.\nMany new products have begun to reach the more cost intensive phases that typically occur after we receive firm customer orders or later as we ramp up our manufacturing operations specific to these products. Important examples include battery thermal management, which began shipping at the end of 2017, and a new automotive electronic control module, which will launch in early 2019. During 2017 and 2016 we incurred expenses of $5,477,000 and $3,400,000, respectively, associated with battery thermal management and $2,600,000 and $2,000,000, respectively for the electronic module. We estimate that these two products will add over $65,000,000 in annual revenue by the time they reach their full run rate in 2020 based on current awarded programs and are likely to grow rapidly in later periods. The growth in the battery thermal management product is expected to mirror an expected rapid growth in 48-volt mild hybrid automotive drive trains for which it is designed whereas the growth in the electronic control module product is anticipated to be driven by market share penetration due to an important design innovation that we believe gives us an important competitive advantage.\nAcquisition Transaction Expenses. During 2017, we incurred $789,000 in fees and expenses associated with the acquisition of Etratech which was completed on November 1, 2017. During 2016, we incurred $743,000 in fees and expenses associated with the acquisition of CSZ which was completed on April 1, 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $130,522,000, which included $1,080,000 in selling, general and administrative expenses for Etratech and $6,100,000 in higher expenses for CSZ due to the additional three months of operations during 2017 as compared to 2016, the year CSZ was acquired. Excluding the Etratech expenses and additional CSZ expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $8,090,000, or 7%, from $115,252,000 in the prior year. This increase was partly due to expenses associated with the transition to a new chief executive officer, higher selling costs for CSZ's medical products business, and increased management incentive compensation costs partially offset by a one-time expense associated with a management reorganization totaling $2,000,000 incurred in 2016 but not 2017. On June 28, 2017 we announced the planned retirement of Daniel R. Coker, our CEO, and related retirement package. During 2017, we recorded expenses totaling $6,694,000 which included accelerated stock compensation amortization and accrued cash bonus. The amount also included a signing bonus and a make whole bonus for Mr. Coker's successor and fees associated with the recruitment process. CSZ's selling expenses include an increase of $3,869,000 associated with a direct sales force for its medical division started during 2017. Our management incentive program includes various forms of equity compensation including stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights ( SARs\u201d). Stock options and restricted stock are accounted for using the equity method and are valued at the grant date fair value and amortized over the respective service period of the employee beneficiary. SARs are accounted for using the liability method since they are settled in cash which requires mark-to-market adjustments based on the current trading price of Gentherm Common Stock. Expenses for this program were $968,000 higher during 2017 as compared to 2016.\nForeign currency gain (loss). During 2017 we incurred a net foreign currency loss of $23,108,000 which included a net realized loss of $1,289,000 and a net unrealized loss of $21,819,000. During 2016, we incurred a net foreign currency gain of $7,810,000 which included a net realized gain of $1,706,000 and a net unrealized gain of $6,104,000. The unrealized loss in 2017 and the unrealized gain in 2016 was primarily the result of holding significant amounts of U.S. Dollar ( USD\u201d) cash at our subsidiaries in Europe which have the European Euro ( EUR\u201d) as the functional currency and due to certain intercompany relationships between these European subsidiaries and our U.S. based companies. During 2017, the USD significantly weakened relative to the EUR but strengthened during 2016. If the USD continues to weaken, we will likely have further unrealized currency losses whereas if the USD strengthens we will likely have unrealized gains.\nIncome Tax Expense. We recorded an income tax expense of $34,028,000 during 2017 which included the one-time transition tax of $20,153,000 relating to the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). Excluding this one-time expense, our income tax expense would have been $13,875,000 representing an effective tax rate of 20% on earnings before income tax of $69,255,000. We recorded an income tax expense of $33,965,000 during 2016 which included the one-time withholding tax expense of $7,600,000 and income tax expense of $2,500,000 related to Reorganization. Excluding these one-time expenses, our income tax expense would have been $23,865,000 representing an effective tax rate of 22% on earnings before income tax of $110,563,000.\nThe Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on all offshore earnings that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. As of December 31, 2017, in accordance with guidance provided by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act; however, in certain cases, as described below, we have made a provisional estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes includes a provisional income tax expense of $20,153,000 related to items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate. In all cases, we will continue to make and refine our calculations as additional analysis is completed. In addition, our estimates may be affected as additional regulatory guidance is issued with respect to the Tax Act. Any adjustments to the provisional amounts will be recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes in the period in which such adjustments are determined, but in any event, no later than the fourth quarter of 2018, in accordance with SAB 118.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities. We remeasured our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at 21%. However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Act and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes includes provisional income tax expense of $5,808,000 related to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances.\nTransition Tax on Deferred Foreign Earnings. The one-time transition tax is based on our post-1986 earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes includes provisional income tax expense of $23,923,000 related to the one-time transition tax liability of our foreign subsidiaries. We have not completed our calculation of the total post-1986 E&P for these foreign subsidiaries. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This amount may change when we finalize the calculation of post-1986 E&P previously deferred from U.S. income taxes and the amounts held in cash or other specified assets. A benefit of $9,578,000 was included in the provision for income taxes to offset the one-time transition tax related to the previous deferred tax liability that existed for the undistributed foreign earnings that were not permanently reinvested. However, we continue to recognize a deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding tax that will be incurred for undistributed foreign earnings that are not permanently reinvested. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the one-time transition tax.\nIndustrial Segment Operating Loss. The Industrial segment, which includes CSZ, GPT and our advanced research and development activities, reported an operating loss totaling $14,751,000 and $16,702,000 during 2017 and 2016, respectively. The loss during 2016 included the one-time purchase accounting adjustment related to the CSZ acquisition. After adjusting for this one-time expense, the 2017 loss was $2,022,000, or 16%, higher than the loss in the Industrial segment, as adjusted, in 2016. We incurred these losses for three reasons. First, the advanced research and development activities, the total cost for which were $13,899,000 and $12,106,000, during 2017 and 2016, respectively, are focused on products and technologies that are currently not generating product revenues. We expect that many of the individual projects included in the business unit will generate profitable revenue in future periods. Second, CSZ incurred approximately $2,000,000 in cost overruns on several large customer environmental test chambers during 2017. These cost overruns are not expected to recur in future periods. Finally, CSZ's $3,869,000 in higher expenses in 2017 associated with the new direct sales force was not yet offset by a corresponding increase in the amount of revenue and related operating income. We continue to believe that the direct sales force will lead to higher CSZ product revenue in future periods that will generate operating profits in excess of the cost for the direct sales persons.\nResults of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nProduct Revenues. Product revenues for 2016 were $917,600,000 compared with product revenues of $856,445,000 for 2015, an increase of $61,155,000, or 7%. This increase was attributable to the acquisition of CSZ, which we acquired on April 1, 2016, and continued growth in our automotive products, partially offset by lower product revenues from GPT. Revenues for CSZ during 2016 were $51,540,000. Our automotive product revenues were higher during 2016 including higher sales for CCS which increased by $9,778,000, or 2% to $412,053,000, higher sales for automotive Seat Heaters which increased by $21,956,000, or 8% to $293,543,000 and Steering Wheel Heaters which increased by $7,482,000, or 18% to $49,689,000. Product revenues from GPT totaled $18,624,000 which represented a decrease of $27,254,000, or 59%. This decrease partly reflects continued softness in the demand for GPT's products in North America, which continues to be unfavorably impacted by the market weakness in the oil industry that has carried over to and reduced capital investments being made by GPT's principal customers that build and operate natural gas pipelines and related natural gas exploration and production companies. During 2015, this weakness had been offset by higher sales of products that are sold into geographical markets outside of GPT's home market of North America. However, these are typically larger custom products which are more impacted by the timing of shipments which favor some periods over others. Fewer of these custom systems were shipped during 2016.\nOur 2015 product revenues were negatively affected by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro when compared to 2016 product revenues.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales increased to $622,563,000 in 2016 from $580,066,000 in 2015. This increase of $42,497,000, or 7%, was due to was due to increased sales volume, including the new product revenues from CSZ, higher overhead for our new production facilities in Vietnam and Macedonia and a one-time $3,973,000 expense from the purchase accounting effect of inventory for the CSZ acquisition. The gross margin percentage was 32.2% during 2016. This amount would have been 32.5% without the impact of the one-time purchase accounting impact for CSZ which is 0.2% higher than the gross margin percentage of 32.3% during 2015. The higher gross margin was due to the CSZ revenue, which has a higher than average gross margin percentage, and a favorable foreign currency impact on production expenses. These were offset partially by the lower GPT revenue, which also has a higher than average gross margin percentage.\nNet Research and Development Expenses. Net research and development expenses were $72,923,000 during 2016 compared to $59,604,000 in 2015, an increase of $13,319,000, or 22%. This increase was primarily driven by higher costs for additional resources,\nincluding personnel, focused on application engineering for new production programs of existing products, development of new products and a program to develop the next generation of seat comfort products. New product development includes automotive cooled storage devices, automotive interior thermal management devices, medical thermal management devices, battery thermal management devices, battery management systems, advanced automotive electronics solutions and other potential products. The CSZ acquisition also increased our net research and development expenses by $1,856,000.\nIncreases in research and development were partially offset by research and development reimbursement totaling $6,660,000 during 2016 and $9,607,000 during 2015.\nWe classify development and prototype costs and related reimbursements as research and development. This is consistent with accounting standards applied in the automotive industry. Depreciation costs for tooling are included in cost of sales.\nAcquisition Transaction Expenses. During 2016, we incurred $743,000 in fees and expenses associated with the acquisition of CSZ which was completed on April 1, 2016. During 2015, we did not incur any acquisition transaction expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $115,252,000, which included $16,258,000 in selling, general and administrative expenses for CSZ, during 2016 from $95,456,000 during 2015. Excluding the CSZ expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $3,538,000, or 4%. This increase primarily resulted from new human resource management system and product lifecycle management business software implementation projects totaling $3,513,000, a one-time expense during the fourth quarter associated with a management reorganization totaling $2,000,000 and higher wages and benefits costs resulting from new employee hiring, merit increases and administrative costs associated with the new facilities in Vietnam and Macedonia, partially offset by lower management incentive expenses.\nSince the trading price of our Common Stock decreased during 2016 but increased during 2015, we recorded a SAR related compensation benefit totaling $738,000 for 2016 as compared with an expense of $6,298,000 during 2015, a change that reduced our total selling, general and administrative expense by $7,035,000 during 2016 compared with 2015.\nForeign currency gain (loss). During 2016 we incurred a net foreign currency gain of $7,810,000 which included a net realized gain of $1,706,000 and a net unrealized gain of $6,104,000. The unrealized gain is primarily the result of holding significant amounts of USD cash at our subsidiaries in Europe which have the EUR as the functional currency and due to certain intercompany relationships between these European subsidiaries and our U.S. based companies. Much of the gain was recorded during the fourth quarter when the USD strengthened relative to the EUR. During 2015, we had a foreign currency loss of $1,121,000. This amount was lower than 2016 mainly due to lower cash balances and due to a higher ratio of cash held as Euro at our European subsidiaries.\nIncome Tax Expense. We recorded an income tax expense of $33,965,000 during 2016 which included the one-time withholding tax expense of $7,600,000 and income tax expense of $2,500,000 related to the Reorganization. Excluding these one-time expenses, our income tax expense would have been $23,865,000 representing an effective tax rate of 22% on earnings before income tax of $110,563,000. We recorded an income tax expense of $33,545,000 during 2015 representing an effective tax rate of 26% on earnings before income tax of $128,938,000. This reduction was due to lower average tax rates on our foreign income. The effective tax rates for 2016, excluding the one-time expense related to the Reorganization, and 2015 were lower than the U.S. Federal rate of 34% primarily due to the impact of lower statutory rates for our subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and Cash Flows\nThe Company has funded its financial needs primarily through cash flows from operating activities and equity and debt financings. Based on its current operating plan, management believes cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017, together with cash flows from operating activities, and borrowing available under our credit agreement, are sufficient to meet operating and capital expenditure needs, and to service debt, for at least the next 12 months. However, if cash flows from operations decline, we may need to obtain alternative sources of capital and reduce or delay capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments, all of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, it is likely that we will need to complete one or more equity or debt financings if we consummate any significant acquisition or a\nnumber of smaller acquisitions. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available at all or on reasonable terms, which could adversely affect our future operations and business strategy.\nThe following table represents our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments:\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 177,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 144,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash from operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (117,688\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (144,338\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash from financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (31,564\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign currency effect on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,212\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 177,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows From Operating Activities\nWe manage our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in order to fund operating requirements and preserve liquidity to take advantage of future business opportunities.

The following table highlights significant differences between the operating cash flows for the periods ending December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively:\nTable 85: <table></table>\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> (in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities during 2016\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 108,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Decrease from lower net income before non-cash adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17,074\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Taxes paid related to the Reorganization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (35,100\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other changes in working capital, net.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,346\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities during 2017\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet income before non-cash adjustments decreased due to higher net research and development expense, higher selling, general and administrative expenses and higher interest expense in 2017 as compared to 2016. These amounts were partially offset by higher product revenue and gross margin. Other changes in working capital, net exclude changes in accrued liabilities associated with the Reorganization tax payments and primarily consist of favorable cash flows related to accounts receivable and inventory and unfavorable amounts related to accounts payable.\nWorking Capital\nThe following table illustrates changes in working capital during 2017:\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> (in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working capital at December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 290,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (74,015\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign currency effect on working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working capital acquired with Etratech\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prepaid expenses and other assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tax payments associated with the Reorganization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working capital at December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 289,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur working capital decreased due to our lower cash balance which was offset by four significant increases, including currency translation, an acquisition, an increase in our prepaid and other assets and tax payments made during 2017. The currency impact of $13,916,000 on working capital is mainly the result of the currency translation of working capital at our European subsidiaries. At December 31, 2017 the U.S. Dollar/European Euro exchange rate was $1.20 as compared with an exchange rate of $1.05 at December 31, 2016. Approximately 22% of our product revenues are generated in Europe. Working capital also increased due to the acquisition of Etratech which had $11,430,000 in working capital when it was acquired on November 1, 2017. Prepaid expenses and other assets were higher primarily due to higher prepaid income tax receivables in Europe. Finally, the Reorganization tax payment, which was accrued as of December 31, 2016, and therefore part of working capital, was paid during the first half of 2017.\nCash Flows From Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $117,688,000 during 2017, reflecting the acquisition of Etratech and purchases of property and equipment related to expansion of production capacity, including at our newest facilities in Mexico, Vietnam and Macedonia, and replacement of existing equipment. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for information regarding the acquisition of Etratech.\nCash Flows From Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities was $31,564,000 during 2017, reflecting payments of principal on the U.S. Revolving Note, DEG China Loan and the DEG Vietnam Loan (each as defined below) totaling $27,156,000 in aggregate. As of December 31, 2017, the total availability under the Revolving Note was $220,859,000. Cash was also paid for cancellations of restricted stock awards totaling $1,837,000.\nDebt\nThe Company, together with certain direct and indirect subsidiaries, has an outstanding credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with a consortium of lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement provides the Company a revolving credit note ( U.S. Revolving Note\u201d) with a maximum borrowing capacity of $350,000,000.\nAll subsidiary borrowers and guarantors participating in the Credit Agreement have entered into a related pledge and security agreement. The security agreement grants a security interest to the lenders in substantially all of the personal property of subsidiaries designated as borrowers to secure their respective obligations under the Credit Agreement, including the stock and membership interest of specified subsidiaries (limited to 66% of the stock in case of certain non-US subsidiaries). The Credit Agreement restricts the amount of dividend payments the Company can make to shareholders.\nThe Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and a Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Definitions for these financial ratios are provided in the Credit Agreement.\nUnder the Credit Agreement, U.S. Dollar denominated loans bear interest at either a base rate ( Base Rate Loans\u201d) or Eurocurrency rate ( Eurocurrency Rate Loans\u201d), plus a margin ( Applicable Rate\u201d). The base rate is equal to the highest of the Federal Funds Rate (1.33% at December 31, 2017) plus 0.50%, Bank of America's prime rate (4.50% at December 31, 2017), or a one month Eurocurrency rate (0.00% at December 31, 2017) plus 1.00%. The Eurocurrency rate for loans denominated in U.S. Dollars is equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (1.56% at December 31, 2017). All loans denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar must be Eurocurrency Rate Loans. Interest is payable at least quarterly.\nThe Applicable Rate varies based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio reported by the Company. As long as the Company is not in default of the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, the lowest and highest possible Applicable Rate is 1.25% and 2.00%, respectively, for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.25% and 1.00%, respectively, for Base Rate Loans.\nThe Company also has two fixed interest rate loans with the German Investment Corporation ( DEG\u201d), a subsidiary of KfW banking group, a German government-owned development bank. The first, a loan we used to fund capital investments in China (the DEG China Loan\u201d), is subject to semi-annual principal payments that began March, 2015 and will end September, 2019. Under the terms of the DEG China Loan, the Company must maintain a minimum Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Current Ratio and Debt Service Coverage Ratio, as defined by the DEG China Loan agreement, based on the financial statements of Gentherm's wholly owned subsidiary, Gentherm Automotive Systems (China) Ltd.\nThe Company's second fixed interest rate senior loan agreement with DEG was used to finance the construction and set up of the Vietnam production facility ( DEG Vietnam Loan\u201d). The DEG Vietnam Loan is subject to semi-annual principal payments that began November, 2017 and will end May, 2023. Under the terms of the DEG Vietnam Loan, the Company must maintain a minimum Currency Ratio, Equity Ratio and Enhanced Equity Ratio, each as defined by the DEG Vietnam Loan agreement, based on the financial statements of Gentherm's wholly owned subsidiary, Gentherm Vietnam Co. Ltd.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's debt at December 31, 2017 (in thousands).\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Interest\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Principal\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Agreement:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Revolving Note (U.S. Dollar Denominations)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.07\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 129,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DEG China Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DEG Vietnam Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.21\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 144,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current portion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,460\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt, less current maturities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 141,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all terms as outlined in the Credit Agreement, DEG China Loan and DEG Vietnam Loan. Undrawn borrowing capacity under the U.S. Revolving Note was $220,859,000 as of December 31, 2017.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nDerivatives and Hedging. In August, 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.\u201d ASU 2017-12 expands the number and type of nonfinancial and interest rate risk components an entity has the ability to designate as the hedged risk in a qualifying hedging relationship. ASU 2017-12 requires entities to present the earnings effect of the hedging instrument in the same income statement line item in which the earnings effect of the hedge item is reported. This approach simplifies the financial statement reporting for qualifying hedging relationships by\neliminating the requirement to separately report the portion of the hedge deemed to be ineffective. For cash flow hedges, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instrument included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Furthermore, income statement effects from fair value and cash flow hedges are to be presented in tabular disclosure.\nASU 2017-12 is effective for annual and any interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption of the amendments in this update are permitted. For cash flow hedges existing at the date of adoption, an entity should apply a cumulative catch-up adjustment related to eliminating the separate measurement of ineffectiveness to accumulative other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year that an entity adopts the amendments in this update. We are currently in the process of determining the impact the implementation of ASU 2017-12 will have on the Company's financial statements.\nShare-Based Payment Awards. In May, 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting.\u201d ASU 2017-09 clarifies which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting, in accordance with Topic 718. An entity should account for the effect of a modification unless all of the following are met:\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 1)\n</td> <td> The fair value of the modified award is the same as the fair value of the original award immediately before the original award is modified. If the modification does not affect any of the inputs of the valuation technique that the entity uses to value the award, the entity is not required to estimate the value immediately before and after the modification.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 2)\n</td> <td> The vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the original award is modified.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 3)\n</td> <td> The classification of the modified award as an equity instrument or a liability instrument is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before the original award is modified.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nASU 2017-09 is effective for annual and any interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption of the amendments in this update is permitted. The amendments in ASU 2017-09 should be applied on a prospective basis and in the initial period of adoption, entities must disclose the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle. The Company has not historically made changes to the terms or conditions of shared-based payment awards and does not expect adoption of ASU 2017-09 to have a material impact the consolidated financial statements when it is adopted in the first quarter of 2018.\nGoodwill Impairment. In January, 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.\u201d ASU 2017-04 modified the concept of impairment of goodwill to be a condition that exists when the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Entities no longer will determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.\nASU 2017-04 is effective for annual and any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption of the amendments in this update is permitted. The amendments in ASU 2017-04 must be applied on a prospective basis and in the initial period of adoption, entities must disclose the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle. The Company expects adoption of ASU 2017-04 will reduce the complexity of evaluating goodwill for impairment.\nBusiness Combinations. In January, 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business\u201d to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. To be considered a business, the integrated set of activities and assets to be evaluated must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create an output. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, the integrated set or activities and assets is not considered a business. ASU 2017-01 provides a framework to assist entities in evaluating whether an integrated set of activities and assets include both an input and a substantive process when the assets' fair value is not concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.\nASU 2017-01 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments in ASU 2017-01 should be applied on or after the effective date. No disclosure is required at adoption. The Company expects the impact from adopting this update to be immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes. In October, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.\u201d ASU 2016-16 modifies the current prohibition to recognize deferred income taxes from differences between the tax basis of assets in the buyer's tax jurisdiction and their cost resulting from an intra-entity transfer from one tax-paying component to another tax-paying component of the same consolidated group. Under current GAAP, deferred income taxes for intra-entity asset transfers are not recognized until the asset is sold to an outside party. ASU 2016-16 allows entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.\nASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. For entities that issue interim financial statements and whose current fiscal year end date is December 31, 2016, early adoption can be made during the three-month period ending March 31, 2017. The amendments in ASU 2016-16 should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. We have evaluated the impact the amendments in ASU 2016-16 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements and determined that a favorable adjustment of approximately $27,771,000 will be recorded directly to retained earnings during the three-month period ending March 31, 2018.\nStatement of Cash Flows. In August, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.\u201d ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on the classification of eight specific cash receipt and cash payment transactions in the statement of cash flows. The Company focused its evaluation on the following transactions to determine the effect ASU 2016-15 will have on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 4)\n</td> <td> Debt extinguishment payments and debt prepayments are to be shown as cash outflows for financing activities.

Early adoption of the amendments in this update is permitted. None of the cash receipt and cash payment transactions, including those that were not the focus of management's evaluation, addressed by the update are transactions that are typical or customary to Gentherm business. According, management does not expect the amendments in this update have a material impact to the Company. Gentherm will adopt the amendments in ASU 2016-15 during the three-month period ending March 31, 2018.\nStock Compensation. In March, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\u201d ASU 2016-09 involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Under the new standard, income tax benefits and deficiencies are to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement and the tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. An entity should also recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. ASU 2016-09 requires excess tax benefits to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity and clarifies that cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity.\nASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 the first quarter of 2017 and recognized a $1,496,000 adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings for previously unrecognized excess tax benefits on share-based payment awards. Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statements of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement were applied retrospectively to all periods presented. Amendments requiring recognition of excess tax payments in the income statement and the classification of those excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows were applied prospectively, beginning with the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. Excess tax benefits on share-based payment awards in the statement of cash flows in prior years have not been adjusted.\nLeases. In February, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).\u201d ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize on their balance sheet a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Payments to be made in optional periods should be included in the measurement of lease assets and liabilities if the lessee is reasonably certain it will exercise an option to extend the lease or not exercise an option to terminate the lease. While ASU 2016-02 continues to differentiate between finance or capital leases and operating leases, the principal change from current lease accounting guidance is that lease assets and liabilities arising from operating leases should be recognized on the balance sheet.\nASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption of the amendments in this update are permitted. Lessees are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach which includes a number of practical expedients, including the ability to use hindsight in evaluating lessee options to extend or terminate a lease. An entity that elects to apply the practical expedients will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all operating leases at each reporting date based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payment that were tracked and disclosed under previous GAAP. We are currently in the process of determining the impact the implementation of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company's financial statements.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers. In May, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d ASU 2014-09 was developed to enable financial statement users to better understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The update's core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Companies are to use a five-step contract review model to ensure revenue gets recognized, measured and disclosed in accordance with this principle. The FASB issued several amendments to the new standard, including a one-year deferral of the original effective date, and new methods for identifying performance obligation aimed at reducing the cost and complexity or compliance.\nThis update permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). We have chosen to use the cumulative catch-up transition method.\nGentherm is in the process of completing the five-step contract review process for all existing contracts with customers, across all business units. While we continue to assess all potential impacts from the update, we currently believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for options that give customers the right to purchase additional goods under long-term supply agreements in the future. Due to the complexity of certain of our automotive supply contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment for customer purchase options will depend on contract-specific terms and could vary from other contracts that are similar in nature. An unfavorable adjustment will be recorded directly to retained earnings during the three-month period ending March 31, 2018. Our current estimate for this adjustment is $3,600,000. We are not aware of any impacts to revenue from contracts with customers at Etratech as a result of our assessment of potential impacts from the update.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe use letters of credit to guarantee our performance under specific construction contracts executed by our subsidiaries, GPT and CSZ. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the contract. Extensions are normally made if performance obligations continue beyond the expected completion date. At December 31, 2017, we had outstanding letters of credit of $141,000.\nTabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2017, the following amounts, aggregated by type of contract obligation, are known to come due in the periods stated:\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 Yr\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Yrs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Yrs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Yrs\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-Term Debt Obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 144,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 134,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,250\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Lease Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,811\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Totals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 173,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 138,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,061\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Long-Term Debt Obligations do not include an amount payable for interest.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company does not have any outstanding capital lease agreements or purchase obligations that exceed one year.\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "Summary:\nThe report discusses the financial condition and operations of Gentherm Incorporated, a technology leader in thermal management.

Further, you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. See also Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in Item 1 of this Report.\nOverview\nGentherm Incorporated is a global technology and industry leader in the design, development, and manufacturing of innovative thermal management technologies. Our products provide solutions for automotive passenger comfort and convenience, battery thermal management, remote power generation, patient temperature management, environmental product testing and other consumer and industrial temperature control needs. Our automotive products can be found on the vehicles of nearly all major automotive manufacturers operating in North America, Europe and Asia. We operate in locations aligned with our major customers' product strategies in order to provide locally enhanced design, integration and production capabilities and to identify future thermal technology product opportunities in both automotive and other markets. We concentrate our research on the development of new technologies and new applications from existing technologies to create product and market opportunities for a wide array of thermal management solutions.\nEtratech\nOn November 1, 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the operating liabilities of Etratech Inc., an Ontario corporation and all of the outstanding shares of Etratech Hong Kong, an entity organized under the laws of Hong Kong, in an all-cash transaction. Etratech manufactures advanced electronic controls and control systems for the automotive, RV and marine, security, medical and other industries. Etratech's world headquarters and North American manufacturing operations are located in Burlington, Canada. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisition of Etratech.\nCincinnati Sub-Zero\nOn April 1, 2016, we acquired all of the equity of privately-held CSZ and related assets in an all-cash transaction. CSZ manufactures both high quality patient temperature management systems for the health care industry and custom testing equipment used by a wide range of industrial manufacturing companies for product testing. CSZ's world headquarters and manufacturing operations are located in Cincinnati, Ohio. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisition of CSZ.\nNorth American Reorganization\nOn January 4, 2016 and January 5, 2016, the Company completed reorganization transactions (the Reorganization\u201d) related to our North American business (the Windsor Operations\u201d). As part of our original integration plan to eliminate redundancies associated with the 2011 acquisition of Gentherm GmbH (formerly named W.E.T. Automotive Systems AG), the Windsor Operations have been consolidated into our existing European and North American facilities. As a result of the Reorganization, some of the business activities previously performed by the Windsor Operations are now being performed by other subsidiaries.\nRelated to the Reorganization, the Company declared intercompany dividends, incurred and paid withholding taxes to the Canadian Revenue Agency of $7,600,000 during 2016. Additionally, the Company incurred income tax expense of $2,500,000 related to the intercompany dividends. These amounts incurred are expected to cover all future intercompany dividends needed to distribute the remaining earnings of the subsidiary to its parent in conjunction with the potential future liquidation of the subsidiary.\nIn addition to the $7,600,000 of withholding tax and $2,500,000 of income taxes, the Reorganization required the Company to make a one-time income tax payment of approximately $32,600,000. The one-time income tax payment was accrued during the first quarter of 2016; however, the Company also recorded an offsetting deferred charge for approximately the same amount because the one-time income tax payment will result in tax deductions against income taxes in future periods. Therefore, the income tax payment did not have a material impact on the Company's earnings during the first quarter of 2016 nor any subsequent quarter. The withholding tax payment was paid entirely in 2016. The income tax payments of $2,500,000 and $32,600,000 that were included in the accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2016, were paid during the first half of 2017.\nReportable Segments\nThe Company has two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: Automotive and Industrial. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our reportable segments as well as their proportional contribution to the Company's reported product revenues and operating income. The financial information used by our chief operating decision maker to assess operating performance and allocate resources is based on these reportable segments.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to:\n \u2022 Product revenues; \n \u2022 Warranty reserves; \n \u2022 Litigation reserves; \n \u2022 Allowances for doubtful accounts; \n \u2022 Income taxes; \n \u2022 Inventory reserves; \n \u2022 Stock compensation; and \n \u2022 Pension plans. \nProduct Revenues\nThe Company sells its products under long term supply or purchase order contracts issued by its customers. These contracts involve the sale of goods and services at fixed prices and provide for related transfer of ownership risk to the customer upon shipment from the Company's warehouse location or in some cases upon receipt of the goods at the customer's facility, or completion of services. Shipping and handling costs are recognized in cost of sales. With only a few minor exceptions, payment terms for these contracts range from 30 to 120 days from the date of shipment. Cash discounts for early payment are only extended to customer purchases recognized within the Industrial reporting segment. Unless a payment is for a distinct good or service, any consideration paid to a customer is recognized directly against the revenue earned from that customer.\nFor construction-type contract revenues recognized in our Industrial segment, the completed-contract method is used to determine revenue and the cost of earned revenue. The transfer of ownership upon shipment is used to determine substantial completion and the recognition of revenue for these construction-type contracts.\nAccrued Warranty Costs\nThe Company accrues warranty obligations for products sold based on management estimates of future failure rates and current claim cost experience, with support from the sales, engineering, quality and legal functions. While we believe our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate, such estimates could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future. The warranty policy is reviewed by management annually. Using historical information available to the Company, including claims already filed by customers, the warranty accrual is adjusted quarterly to reflect management's best estimate of future claims.\nLitigation Reserves\nWe record estimated future costs related to new or ongoing litigation based on input from legal counsel and our best estimate of potential loss. These estimates include costs associated with attorney fees and potential claims and assessments less any amounts we anticipate are recoverable under insurance policies. Final resolution of the litigation contingencies could result in amounts different from current accruals and, therefore, have an impact on our consolidated financial results in future reporting periods.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe record an allowance for doubtful accounts once exposure to collection risk of an accounts receivable is specifically identified. We analyze the length of time an account receivable is outstanding, as well as a customer's payment history to determine the need for and amount of an allowance for doubtful accounts.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record income tax expense using the liability method which specifies that deferred tax assets and liabilities be measured each year based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when management considers it more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, a valuation allowance has been provided for certain deferred tax assets which we have concluded are more likely than not to not be realized. If future annual taxable income were to be significantly less than current and projected levels, there is a risk that certain of our deferred tax assets not already provided for by the valuation allowance would expire prior to utilization.\nWe recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount\nrecognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.\nInventory Reserves\nWe recognize a reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventories based on estimates of future sales and an inventory item's capacity to be repurposed for a different use. We consider the number of months supply on hand based on current planned requirements, uncommitted future projections and historical usage in estimating the inventory reserve. Additional provisions are made for supplier claims for obsolete materials, prototype inventory, spare or customer service inventory and, for all periods other than at year-end, estimates for physical inventory adjustments.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe account for grants of employee stock options and restricted stock as compensation expense based upon the fair value on the date of grant and such expense is recognized over the vesting period. We determine fair value of awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporates certain assumptions, such as expected volatility, expected life of options, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield, in order to arrive at a fair value estimate. Expected volatilities are based on the average of the historical volatility of the Company's Common Stock and that of an index of companies in our industry group. To evaluate our assumptions for the expected lives of options, we consider the average holding period of previously exercised options and the remaining terms of outstanding options. The risk free interest rate is based upon quoted market yields for United States Treasury debt securities. The expected dividend yield is based upon the Company's history of having never issued a dividend, the limitations to issue a dividend under the Amended Credit Agreement and management's current expectation regarding future dividends. We believe that the assumptions selected by management are reasonable; however, significant changes could materially impact the results of the calculation of fair value.\nPension Plans\nThe Company's obligations and expenses for its pension plans are substantially dependent on the Company's selection of discount rate and, for the Gentherm GmbH Plan, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions used by actuaries to calculate these amounts. Actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and amortized over future periods and generally affect recognized expense in future periods. As such, assumptions used to calculate benefit obligations as of the annual measurement date directly impact the expense to be recognized in future periods. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the pension plans, including their impact to Gentherm's financial statements.\nResults of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nProduct Revenues. Product revenues for 2017 were $985,683,000 compared with product revenues of $917,600,000 for 2016, an increase of $68,083,000, or 7.4%. This increase included the full year effect of the 2016 acquisition of CSZ, which operated as a part of Gentherm for a full year in 2017 but only for nine months during 2016, $8,398,000 in additional revenue attributable to the 2017 acquisition of Etratech after it was acquired on November 1, 2017, and a $4,995,000 favorable impact of foreign currency translation. Adjusting for these effects, our pro-forma product revenue growth was 4.6% and included a 2.7% increase in Automotive segment product revenues to $879,457,000 and a 23.4% increase in Industrial segment product revenue to 106,226,000.\nThe increase in the Automotive segment occurred despite lower global automotive production volumes and a special rebate of $2,000,000 recorded during 2017. The increases included higher revenue volume for seat heaters, totaling $18,370,000, or 6.4%, steering wheel heaters of $12,609,000, or 25.5%, automotive cable systems of $6,810,000, or 8.0%, and battery thermal management products of $3,497,000, or 53.4%. These higher amounts were attributable to new program awards, higher vehicle application rates and higher component content. Higher component content in seat heaters, for example, included a greater number of programs for which Gentherm provides the electronic controlling device along with the heating element. These increases were partially offset by lower Climate Controlled Seats ( CCS\u201d) product revenues which decreased by $17,834,000 or 4.4%. CCS product revenue was disproportionately impacted by the lower global production volumes which were more unfavorable in our primary CCS market, North America, which was down by 4%, compared to an increase of 2% for the global automotive industry. CCS revenues were also reduced as a result of certain vehicle programs changing technologies from the higher priced active cooling seat application to the lower priced heated and ventilated seat technology.\nProduct revenues from Global Power Technologies ( GPT\u201d) totaled $31,891,000 which represented an increase of $13,263,000, or 71%. Continuing market weakness in North America was more than offset by higher sales to other markets. Product sales in this business unit are typically large custom remote power systems having long lead times and, during 2017, there were more shipments than in the prior year. During 2016, demand for GPT's products sold in North America was unfavorably impacted by lower oil prices. While we do not generally sell our products for oil exploration, production or transportation activities, the impact of lower oil prices reduced capital investments for the natural gas industry being made by GPT's principal customers. As a result, those customers curtailed orders during that year.\nCSZ product revenue increased by $22,791,000 which included both an acquisition related increase of $15,905,000 and organic growth of $6,886,000, or 10%. This increase included higher revenue of environmental chamber products totaling $8,106,000 or 22% partially offset by lower revenue of patient temperature management products of $1,220,000 or 3.9%. The higher revenue for environmental chambers included several large custom orders as well as stronger demand for standard chambers. Patient temperature management product revenue equally benefited 2017 and 2016 from a temporary surge in demand for the Hemotherm product, a blood heater cooler used in hospital operating rooms during open heart surgery, but did not yet show improvements associated with a transition to a direct sales force that occurred throughout 2017.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales increased to $674,570,000 in 2017 from $622,563,000 in 2016. The increase of $52,007,000, or 8%, was due to increased sales volume, unfavorable inventory adjustments, other increased expenses and changes in product mix partially offset by a one-time $3,973,000 expense from the purchase accounting effect of inventory for the CSZ acquisition which occurred in 2016. The gross margin rate was 31.6% during 2017 representing a decrease of 60 basis points as compared with the 2016 gross margin rate of 32.2%. This decrease was due to the special rebate and the inventory adjustments and the higher expenses. The unfavorable inventory adjustments totaled $2,307,000 and were mainly comprised of a reserve recorded for inventory held for the heated and cooled mattress product line based upon a reduced sales outlook. Increased expenses totaling approximately $7,000,000 included higher fixed costs associated with our new manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Macedonia, labor expense inflation at our Ukraine factory, and factory launch expenses for the new advanced battery thermal management product and electronics.\nNet Research and Development Expenses. Net research and development expenses were $82,478,000 during 2017 compared to $72,923,000 in 2016, an increase of $9,555,000, or 13%. This increase was primarily driven by higher costs for additional resources, including personnel focused on application engineering for new production programs of existing products, development of new products and a program to develop the next generation of seat comfort products. New product development includes automotive cooled storage devices, automotive interior thermal management devices, medical thermal management devices, battery thermal management devices, battery management systems, advanced automotive electronics solutions and other potential products.\nIncreases in research and development were partially offset by research and development reimbursement totaling $12,037,000 during 2017 and $6,660,000 during 2016. We classify development and prototype costs and related reimbursements as research and development. This is consistent with accounting standards applied in the automotive industry. Depreciation costs for tooling are included in cost of sales.\nMany new products have begun to reach the more cost intensive phases that typically occur after we receive firm customer orders or later as we ramp up our manufacturing operations specific to these products. Important examples include battery thermal management, which began shipping at the end of 2017, and a new automotive electronic control module, which will launch in early 2019. During 2017 and 2016 we incurred expenses of $5,477,000 and $3,400,000, respectively, associated with battery thermal management and $2,600,000 and $2,000,000, respectively for the electronic module. We estimate that these two products will add over $65,000,000 in annual revenue by the time they reach their full run rate in 2020 based on current awarded programs and are likely to grow rapidly in later periods. The growth in the battery thermal management product is expected to mirror an expected rapid growth in 48-volt mild hybrid automotive drive trains for which it is designed whereas the growth in the electronic control module product is anticipated to be driven by market share penetration due to an important design innovation that we believe gives us an important competitive advantage.\nAcquisition Transaction Expenses. During 2017, we incurred $789,000 in fees and expenses associated with the acquisition of Etratech which was completed on November 1, 2017. During 2016, we incurred $743,000 in fees and expenses associated with the acquisition of CSZ which was completed on April 1, 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $130,522,000, which included $1,080,000 in selling, general and administrative expenses for Etratech and $6,100,000 in higher expenses for CSZ due to the additional three months of operations during 2017 as compared to 2016, the year CSZ was acquired. Excluding the Etratech expenses and additional CSZ expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $8,090,000, or 7%, from $115,252,000 in the prior year. This increase was partly due to expenses associated with the transition to a new chief executive officer, higher selling costs for CSZ's medical products business, and increased management incentive compensation costs partially offset by a one-time expense associated with a management reorganization totaling $2,000,000 incurred in 2016 but not 2017. On June 28, 2017 we announced the planned retirement of Daniel R. Coker, our CEO, and related retirement package. During 2017, we recorded expenses totaling $6,694,000 which included accelerated stock compensation amortization and accrued cash bonus. The amount also included a signing bonus and a make whole bonus for Mr. Coker's successor and fees associated with the recruitment process. CSZ's selling expenses include an increase of $3,869,000 associated with a direct sales force for its medical division started during 2017. Our management incentive program includes various forms of equity compensation including stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights ( SARs\u201d). Stock options and restricted stock are accounted for using the equity method and are valued at the grant date fair value and amortized over the respective service period of the employee beneficiary. SARs are accounted for using the liability method since they are settled in cash which requires mark-to-market adjustments based on the current trading price of Gentherm Common Stock. Expenses for this program were $968,000 higher during 2017 as compared to 2016.\nForeign currency gain (loss). During 2017 we incurred a net foreign currency loss of $23,108,000 which included a net realized loss of $1,289,000 and a net unrealized loss of $21,819,000. During 2016, we incurred a net foreign currency gain of $7,810,000 which included a net realized gain of $1,706,000 and a net unrealized gain of $6,104,000. The unrealized loss in 2017 and the unrealized gain in 2016 was primarily the result of holding significant amounts of U.S. Dollar ( USD\u201d) cash at our subsidiaries in Europe which have the European Euro ( EUR\u201d) as the functional currency and due to certain intercompany relationships between these European subsidiaries and our U.S. based companies. During 2017, the USD significantly weakened relative to the EUR but strengthened during 2016. If the USD continues to weaken, we will likely have further unrealized currency losses whereas if the USD strengthens we will likely have unrealized gains.\nIncome Tax Expense. We recorded an income tax expense of $34,028,000 during 2017 which included the one-time transition tax of $20,153,000 relating to the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). Excluding this one-time expense, our income tax expense would have been $13,875,000 representing an effective tax rate of 20% on earnings before income tax of $69,255,000. We recorded an income tax expense of $33,965,000 during 2016 which included the one-time withholding tax expense of $7,600,000 and income tax expense of $2,500,000 related to Reorganization. Excluding these one-time expenses, our income tax expense would have been $23,865,000 representing an effective tax rate of 22% on earnings before income tax of $110,563,000.\nThe Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on all offshore earnings that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. As of December 31, 2017, in accordance with guidance provided by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act; however, in certain cases, as described below, we have made a provisional estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes includes a provisional income tax expense of $20,153,000 related to items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate. In all cases, we will continue to make and refine our calculations as additional analysis is completed. In addition, our estimates may be affected as additional regulatory guidance is issued with respect to the Tax Act. Any adjustments to the provisional amounts will be recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes in the period in which such adjustments are determined, but in any event, no later than the fourth quarter of 2018, in accordance with SAB 118.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities. We remeasured our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at 21%. However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Act and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes includes provisional income tax expense of $5,808,000 related to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances.\nTransition Tax on Deferred Foreign Earnings. The one-time transition tax is based on our post-1986 earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes includes provisional income tax expense of $23,923,000 related to the one-time transition tax liability of our foreign subsidiaries. We have not completed our calculation of the total post-1986 E&P for these foreign subsidiaries. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This amount may change when we finalize the calculation of post-1986 E&P previously deferred from U.S. income taxes and the amounts held in cash or other specified assets. A benefit of $9,578,000 was included in the provision for income taxes to offset the one-time transition tax related to the previous deferred tax liability that existed for the undistributed foreign earnings that were not permanently reinvested. However, we continue to recognize a deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding tax that will be incurred for undistributed foreign earnings that are not permanently reinvested. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the one-time transition tax.\nIndustrial Segment Operating Loss. The Industrial segment, which includes CSZ, GPT and our advanced research and development activities, reported an operating loss totaling $14,751,000 and $16,702,000 during 2017 and 2016, respectively. The loss during 2016 included the one-time purchase accounting adjustment related to the CSZ acquisition. After adjusting for this one-time expense, the 2017 loss was $2,022,000, or 16%, higher than the loss in the Industrial segment, as adjusted, in 2016. We incurred these losses for three reasons. First, the advanced research and development activities, the total cost for which were $13,899,000 and $12,106,000, during 2017 and 2016, respectively, are focused on products and technologies that are currently not generating product revenues. We expect that many of the individual projects included in the business unit will generate profitable revenue in future periods. Second, CSZ incurred approximately $2,000,000 in cost overruns on several large customer environmental test chambers during 2017. These cost overruns are not expected to recur in future periods. Finally, CSZ's $3,869,000 in higher expenses in 2017 associated with the new direct sales force was not yet offset by a corresponding increase in the amount of revenue and related operating income. We continue to believe that the direct sales force will lead to higher CSZ product revenue in future periods that will generate operating profits in excess of the cost for the direct sales persons.\nResults of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nProduct Revenues. Product revenues for 2016 were $917,600,000 compared with product revenues of $856,445,000 for 2015, an increase of $61,155,000, or 7%. This increase was attributable to the acquisition of CSZ, which we acquired on April 1, 2016, and continued growth in our automotive products, partially offset by lower product revenues from GPT. Revenues for CSZ during 2016 were $51,540,000. Our automotive product revenues were higher during 2016 including higher sales for CCS which increased by $9,778,000, or 2% to $412,053,000, higher sales for automotive Seat Heaters which increased by $21,956,000, or 8% to $293,543,000 and Steering Wheel Heaters which increased by $7,482,000, or 18% to $49,689,000. Product revenues from GPT totaled $18,624,000 which represented a decrease of $27,254,000, or 59%. This decrease partly reflects continued softness in the demand for GPT's products in North America, which continues to be unfavorably impacted by the market weakness in the oil industry that has carried over to and reduced capital investments being made by GPT's principal customers that build and operate natural gas pipelines and related natural gas exploration and production companies. During 2015, this weakness had been offset by higher sales of products that are sold into geographical markets outside of GPT's home market of North America. However, these are typically larger custom products which are more impacted by the timing of shipments which favor some periods over others. Fewer of these custom systems were shipped during 2016.\nOur 2015 product revenues were negatively affected by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro when compared to 2016 product revenues.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales increased to $622,563,000 in 2016 from $580,066,000 in 2015. This increase of $42,497,000, or 7%, was due to was due to increased sales volume, including the new product revenues from CSZ, higher overhead for our new production facilities in Vietnam and Macedonia and a one-time $3,973,000 expense from the purchase accounting effect of inventory for the CSZ acquisition. The gross margin percentage was 32.2% during 2016. This amount would have been 32.5% without the impact of the one-time purchase accounting impact for CSZ which is 0.2% higher than the gross margin percentage of 32.3% during 2015. The higher gross margin was due to the CSZ revenue, which has a higher than average gross margin percentage, and a favorable foreign currency impact on production expenses. These were offset partially by the lower GPT revenue, which also has a higher than average gross margin percentage.\nNet Research and Development Expenses. Net research and development expenses were $72,923,000 during 2016 compared to $59,604,000 in 2015, an increase of $13,319,000, or 22%. This increase was primarily driven by higher costs for additional resources,\nincluding personnel, focused on application engineering for new production programs of existing products, development of new products and a program to develop the next generation of seat comfort products. New product development includes automotive cooled storage devices, automotive interior thermal management devices, medical thermal management devices, battery thermal management devices, battery management systems, advanced automotive electronics solutions and other potential products. The CSZ acquisition also increased our net research and development expenses by $1,856,000.\nIncreases in research and development were partially offset by research and development reimbursement totaling $6,660,000 during 2016 and $9,607,000 during 2015.\nWe classify development and prototype costs and related reimbursements as research and development. This is consistent with accounting standards applied in the automotive industry. Depreciation costs for tooling are included in cost of sales.\nAcquisition Transaction Expenses. During 2016, we incurred $743,000 in fees and expenses associated with the acquisition of CSZ which was completed on April 1, 2016. During 2015, we did not incur any acquisition transaction expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $115,252,000,", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, our consolidated financial statements (and notes related thereto) and other more detailed financial information appearing elsewhere in this Report. Further, you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. See also Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in Item 1 of this Report.\nOverview\nGentherm Incorporated is a global technology and industry leader in the design, development, and manufacturing of innovative thermal management technologies. Our products provide solutions for automotive passenger comfort and convenience, battery thermal management, remote power generation, patient temperature management, environmental product testing and other consumer and industrial temperature control needs. Our automotive products can be found on the vehicles of nearly all major automotive manufacturers operating in North America, Europe and Asia. We operate in locations aligned with our major customers' product strategies in order to provide locally enhanced design, integration and production capabilities and to identify future thermal technology product opportunities in both automotive and other markets. We concentrate our research on the development of new technologies and new applications from existing technologies to create product and market opportunities for a wide array of thermal management solutions.\nEtratech\nOn November 1, 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the operating liabilities of Etratech Inc., an Ontario corporation and all of the outstanding shares of Etratech Hong Kong, an entity organized under the laws of Hong Kong, in an all-cash transaction. Etratech manufactures advanced electronic controls and control systems for the automotive, RV and marine, security, medical and other industries. Etratech's world headquarters and North American manufacturing operations are located in Burlington, Canada. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisition of Etratech.\nCincinnati Sub-Zero\nOn April 1, 2016, we acquired all of the equity of privately-held CSZ and related assets in an all-cash transaction. CSZ manufactures both high quality patient temperature management systems for the health care industry and custom testing equipment used by a wide range of industrial manufacturing companies for product testing. CSZ's world headquarters and manufacturing operations are located in Cincinnati, Ohio. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisition of CSZ.\nNorth American Reorganization\nOn January 4, 2016 and January 5, 2016, the Company completed reorganization transactions (the Reorganization\u201d) related to our North American business (the Windsor Operations\u201d). As part of our original integration plan to eliminate redundancies associated with the 2011 acquisition of Gentherm GmbH (formerly named W.E.T. Automotive Systems AG), the Windsor Operations have been consolidated into our existing European and North American facilities. As a result of the Reorganization, some of the business activities previously performed by the Windsor Operations are now being performed by other subsidiaries.\nRelated to the Reorganization, the Company declared intercompany dividends, incurred and paid withholding taxes to the Canadian Revenue Agency of $7,600,000 during 2016. Additionally, the Company incurred income tax expense of $2,500,000 related to the intercompany dividends. These amounts incurred are expected to cover all future intercompany dividends needed to distribute the remaining earnings of the subsidiary to its parent in conjunction with the potential future liquidation of the subsidiary.\nIn addition to the $7,600,000 of withholding tax and $2,500,000 of income taxes, the Reorganization required the Company to make a one-time income tax payment of approximately $32,600,000. The one-time income tax payment was accrued during the first quarter of 2016; however, the Company also recorded an offsetting deferred charge for approximately the same amount because the one-time income tax payment will result in tax deductions against income taxes in future periods. Therefore, the income tax payment did not have a material impact on the Company's earnings during the first quarter of 2016 nor any subsequent quarter. The withholding tax payment was paid entirely in 2016. The income tax payments of $2,500,000 and $32,600,000 that were included in the accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2016, were paid during the first half of 2017.\nReportable Segments\nThe Company has two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: Automotive and Industrial. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our reportable segments as well as their proportional contribution to the Company's reported product revenues and operating income. The financial information used by our chief operating decision maker to assess operating performance and allocate resources is based on these reportable segments.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to:\n \u2022 Product revenues; \n \u2022 Warranty reserves; \n \u2022 Litigation reserves; \n \u2022 Allowances for doubtful accounts; \n \u2022 Income taxes; \n \u2022 Inventory reserves; \n \u2022 Stock compensation; and \n \u2022 Pension plans. \nProduct Revenues\nThe Company sells its products under long term supply or purchase order contracts issued by its customers. These contracts involve the sale of goods and services at fixed prices and provide for related transfer of ownership risk to the customer upon shipment from the Company's warehouse location or in some cases upon receipt of the goods at the customer's facility, or completion of services. Shipping and handling costs are recognized in cost of sales. With only a few minor exceptions, payment terms for these contracts range from 30 to 120 days from the date of shipment. Cash discounts for early payment are only extended to customer purchases recognized within the Industrial reporting segment. Unless a payment is for a distinct good or service, any consideration paid to a customer is recognized directly against the revenue earned from that customer.\nFor construction-type contract revenues recognized in our Industrial segment, the completed-contract method is used to determine revenue and the cost of earned revenue. The transfer of ownership upon shipment is used to determine substantial completion and the recognition of revenue for these construction-type contracts.\nAccrued Warranty Costs\nThe Company accrues warranty obligations for products sold based on management estimates of future failure rates and current claim cost experience, with support from the sales, engineering, quality and legal functions. While we believe our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate, such estimates could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future. The warranty policy is reviewed by management annually. Using historical information available to the Company, including claims already filed by customers, the warranty accrual is adjusted quarterly to reflect management's best estimate of future claims.\nLitigation Reserves\nWe record estimated future costs related to new or ongoing litigation based on input from legal counsel and our best estimate of potential loss. These estimates include costs associated with attorney fees and potential claims and assessments less any amounts we anticipate are recoverable under insurance policies. Final resolution of the litigation contingencies could result in amounts different from current accruals and, therefore, have an impact on our consolidated financial results in future reporting periods.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe record an allowance for doubtful accounts once exposure to collection risk of an accounts receivable is specifically identified. We analyze the length of time an account receivable is outstanding, as well as a customer's payment history to determine the need for and amount of an allowance for doubtful accounts.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record income tax expense using the liability method which specifies that deferred tax assets and liabilities be measured each year based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when management considers it more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, a valuation allowance has been provided for certain deferred tax assets which we have concluded are more likely than not to not be realized. If future annual taxable income were to be significantly less than current and projected levels, there is a risk that certain of our deferred tax assets not already provided for by the valuation allowance would expire prior to utilization.\nWe recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount\nrecognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.\nInventory Reserves\nWe recognize a reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventories based on estimates of future sales and an inventory item's capacity to be repurposed for a different use. We consider the number of months supply on hand based on current planned requirements, uncommitted future projections and historical usage in estimating the inventory reserve. Additional provisions are made for supplier claims for obsolete materials, prototype inventory, spare or customer service inventory and, for all periods other than at year-end, estimates for physical inventory adjustments.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe account for grants of employee stock options and restricted stock as compensation expense based upon the fair value on the date of grant and such expense is recognized over the vesting period. We determine fair value of awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporates certain assumptions, such as expected volatility, expected life of options, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield, in order to arrive at a fair value estimate. Expected volatilities are based on the average of the historical volatility of the Company's Common Stock and that of an index of companies in our industry group. To evaluate our assumptions for the expected lives of options, we consider the average holding period of previously exercised options and the remaining terms of outstanding options. The risk free interest rate is based upon quoted market yields for United States Treasury debt securities. The expected dividend yield is based upon the Company's history of having never issued a dividend, the limitations to issue a dividend under the Amended Credit Agreement and management's current expectation regarding future dividends. We believe that the assumptions selected by management are reasonable; however, significant changes could materially impact the results of the calculation of fair value.\nPension Plans\nThe Company's obligations and expenses for its pension plans are substantially dependent on the Company's selection of discount rate and, for the Gentherm GmbH Plan, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions used by actuaries to calculate these amounts. Actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and amortized over future periods and generally affect recognized expense in future periods. As such, assumptions used to calculate benefit obligations as of the annual measurement date directly impact the expense to be recognized in future periods. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the pension plans, including their impact to Gentherm's financial statements.\nResults of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nProduct Revenues. Product revenues for 2017 were $985,683,000 compared with product revenues of $917,600,000 for 2016, an increase of $68,083,000, or 7.4%. This increase included the full year effect of the 2016 acquisition of CSZ, which operated as a part of Gentherm for a full year in 2017 but only for nine months during 2016, $8,398,000 in additional revenue attributable to the 2017 acquisition of Etratech after it was acquired on November 1, 2017, and a $4,995,000 favorable impact of foreign currency translation. Adjusting for these effects, our pro-forma product revenue growth was 4.6% and included a 2.7% increase in Automotive segment product revenues to $879,457,000 and a 23.4% increase in Industrial segment product revenue to 106,226,000.\nThe increase in the Automotive segment occurred despite lower global automotive production volumes and a special rebate of $2,000,000 recorded during 2017. The increases included higher revenue volume for seat heaters, totaling $18,370,000, or 6.4%, steering wheel heaters of $12,609,000, or 25.5%, automotive cable systems of $6,810,000, or 8.0%, and battery thermal management products of $3,497,000, or 53.4%. These higher amounts were attributable to new program awards, higher vehicle application rates and higher component content. Higher component content in seat heaters, for example, included a greater number of programs for which Gentherm provides the electronic controlling device along with the heating element. These increases were partially offset by lower Climate Controlled Seats ( CCS\u201d) product revenues which decreased by $17,834,000 or 4.4%. CCS product revenue was disproportionately impacted by the lower global production volumes which were more unfavorable in our primary CCS market, North America, which was down by 4%, compared to an increase of 2% for the global automotive industry. CCS revenues were also reduced as a result of certain vehicle programs changing technologies from the higher priced active cooling seat application to the lower priced heated and ventilated seat technology.\nProduct revenues from Global Power Technologies ( GPT\u201d) totaled $31,891,000 which represented an increase of $13,263,000, or 71%. Continuing market weakness in North America was more than offset by higher sales to other markets. Product sales in this business unit are typically large custom remote power systems having long lead times and, during 2017, there were more shipments than in the prior year. During 2016, demand for GPT's products sold in North America was unfavorably impacted by lower oil prices. While we do not generally sell our products for oil exploration, production or transportation activities, the impact of lower oil prices reduced capital investments for the natural gas industry being made by GPT's principal customers. As a result, those customers curtailed orders during that year.\nCSZ product revenue increased by $22,791,000 which included both an acquisition related increase of $15,905,000 and organic growth of $6,886,000, or 10%. This increase included higher revenue of environmental chamber products totaling $8,106,000 or 22% partially offset by lower revenue of patient temperature management products of $1,220,000 or 3.9%. The higher revenue for environmental chambers included several large custom orders as well as stronger demand for standard chambers. Patient temperature management product revenue equally benefited 2017 and 2016 from a temporary surge in demand for the Hemotherm product, a blood heater cooler used in hospital operating rooms during open heart surgery, but did not yet show improvements associated with a transition to a direct sales force that occurred throughout 2017.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales increased to $674,570,000 in 2017 from $622,563,000 in 2016. The increase of $52,007,000, or 8%, was due to increased sales volume, unfavorable inventory adjustments, other increased expenses and changes in product mix partially offset by a one-time $3,973,000 expense from the purchase accounting effect of inventory for the CSZ acquisition which occurred in 2016. The gross margin rate was 31.6% during 2017 representing a decrease of 60 basis points as compared with the 2016 gross margin rate of 32.2%. This decrease was due to the special rebate and the inventory adjustments and the higher expenses. The unfavorable inventory adjustments totaled $2,307,000 and were mainly comprised of a reserve recorded for inventory held for the heated and cooled mattress product line based upon a reduced sales outlook. Increased expenses totaling approximately $7,000,000 included higher fixed costs associated with our new manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Macedonia, labor expense inflation at our Ukraine factory, and factory launch expenses for the new advanced battery thermal management product and electronics.\nNet Research and Development Expenses. Net research and development expenses were $82,478,000 during 2017 compared to $72,923,000 in 2016, an increase of $9,555,000, or 13%. This increase was primarily driven by higher costs for additional resources, including personnel focused on application engineering for new production programs of existing products, development of new products and a program to develop the next generation of seat comfort products. New product development includes automotive cooled storage devices, automotive interior thermal management devices, medical thermal management devices, battery thermal management devices, battery management systems, advanced automotive electronics solutions and other potential products.\nIncreases in research and development were partially offset by research and development reimbursement totaling $12,037,000 during 2017 and $6,660,000 during 2016. We classify development and prototype costs and related reimbursements as research and development. This is consistent with accounting standards applied in the automotive industry. Depreciation costs for tooling are included in cost of sales.\nMany new products have begun to reach the more cost intensive phases that typically occur after we receive firm customer orders or later as we ramp up our manufacturing operations specific to these products. Important examples include battery thermal management, which began shipping at the end of 2017, and a new automotive electronic control module, which will launch in early 2019. During 2017 and 2016 we incurred expenses of $5,477,000 and $3,400,000, respectively, associated with battery thermal management and $2,600,000 and $2,000,000, respectively for the electronic module. We estimate that these two products will add over $65,000,000 in annual revenue by the time they reach their full run rate in 2020 based on current awarded programs and are likely to grow rapidly in later periods. The growth in the battery thermal management product is expected to mirror an expected rapid growth in 48-volt mild hybrid automotive drive trains for which it is designed whereas the growth in the electronic control module product is anticipated to be driven by market share penetration due to an important design innovation that we believe gives us an important competitive advantage.\nAcquisition Transaction Expenses. During 2017, we incurred $789,000 in fees and expenses associated with the acquisition of Etratech which was completed on November 1, 2017. During 2016, we incurred $743,000 in fees and expenses associated with the acquisition of CSZ which was completed on April 1, 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $130,522,000, which included $1,080,000 in selling, general and administrative expenses for Etratech and $6,100,000 in higher expenses for CSZ due to the additional three months of operations during 2017 as compared to 2016, the year CSZ was acquired. Excluding the Etratech expenses and additional CSZ expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $8,090,000, or 7%, from $115,252,000 in the prior year. This increase was partly due to expenses associated with the transition to a new chief executive officer, higher selling costs for CSZ's medical products business, and increased management incentive compensation costs partially offset by a one-time expense associated with a management reorganization totaling $2,000,000 incurred in 2016 but not 2017. On June 28, 2017 we announced the planned retirement of Daniel R. Coker, our CEO, and related retirement package. During 2017, we recorded expenses totaling $6,694,000 which included accelerated stock compensation amortization and accrued cash bonus. The amount also included a signing bonus and a make whole bonus for Mr. Coker's successor and fees associated with the recruitment process. CSZ's selling expenses include an increase of $3,869,000 associated with a direct sales force for its medical division started during 2017. Our management incentive program includes various forms of equity compensation including stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights ( SARs\u201d). Stock options and restricted stock are accounted for using the equity method and are valued at the grant date fair value and amortized over the respective service period of the employee beneficiary. SARs are accounted for using the liability method since they are settled in cash which requires mark-to-market adjustments based on the current trading price of Gentherm Common Stock. Expenses for this program were $968,000 higher during 2017 as compared to 2016.\nForeign currency gain (loss). During 2017 we incurred a net foreign currency loss of $23,108,000 which included a net realized loss of $1,289,000 and a net unrealized loss of $21,819,000. During 2016, we incurred a net foreign currency gain of $7,810,000 which included a net realized gain of $1,706,000 and a net unrealized gain of $6,104,000. The unrealized loss in 2017 and the unrealized gain in 2016 was primarily the result of holding significant amounts of U.S. Dollar ( USD\u201d) cash at our subsidiaries in Europe which have the European Euro ( EUR\u201d) as the functional currency and due to certain intercompany relationships between these European subsidiaries and our U.S. based companies. During 2017, the USD significantly weakened relative to the EUR but strengthened during 2016. If the USD continues to weaken, we will likely have further unrealized currency losses whereas if the USD strengthens we will likely have unrealized gains.\nIncome Tax Expense. We recorded an income tax expense of $34,028,000 during 2017 which included the one-time transition tax of $20,153,000 relating to the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). Excluding this one-time expense, our income tax expense would have been $13,875,000 representing an effective tax rate of 20% on earnings before income tax of $69,255,000. We recorded an income tax expense of $33,965,000 during 2016 which included the one-time withholding tax expense of $7,600,000 and income tax expense of $2,500,000 related to Reorganization. Excluding these one-time expenses, our income tax expense would have been $23,865,000 representing an effective tax rate of 22% on earnings before income tax of $110,563,000.\nThe Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on all offshore earnings that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. As of December 31, 2017, in accordance with guidance provided by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act; however, in certain cases, as described below, we have made a provisional estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes includes a provisional income tax expense of $20,153,000 related to items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate. In all cases, we will continue to make and refine our calculations as additional analysis is completed. In addition, our estimates may be affected as additional regulatory guidance is issued with respect to the Tax Act. Any adjustments to the provisional amounts will be recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes in the period in which such adjustments are determined, but in any event, no later than the fourth quarter of 2018, in accordance with SAB 118.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities. We remeasured our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at 21%. However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Act and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes includes provisional income tax expense of $5,808,000 related to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances.\nTransition Tax on Deferred Foreign Earnings. The one-time transition tax is based on our post-1986 earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes includes provisional income tax expense of $23,923,000 related to the one-time transition tax liability of our foreign subsidiaries. We have not completed our calculation of the total post-1986 E&P for these foreign subsidiaries. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This amount may change when we finalize the calculation of post-1986 E&P previously deferred from U.S. income taxes and the amounts held in cash or other specified assets. A benefit of $9,578,000 was included in the provision for income taxes to offset the one-time transition tax related to the previous deferred tax liability that existed for the undistributed foreign earnings that were not permanently reinvested. However, we continue to recognize a deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding tax that will be incurred for undistributed foreign earnings that are not permanently reinvested. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the one-time transition tax.\nIndustrial Segment Operating Loss. The Industrial segment, which includes CSZ, GPT and our advanced research and development activities, reported an operating loss totaling $14,751,000 and $16,702,000 during 2017 and 2016, respectively. The loss during 2016 included the one-time purchase accounting adjustment related to the CSZ acquisition. After adjusting for this one-time expense, the 2017 loss was $2,022,000, or 16%, higher than the loss in the Industrial segment, as adjusted, in 2016. We incurred these losses for three reasons. First, the advanced research and development activities, the total cost for which were $13,899,000 and $12,106,000, during 2017 and 2016, respectively, are focused on products and technologies that are currently not generating product revenues. We expect that many of the individual projects included in the business unit will generate profitable revenue in future periods. Second, CSZ incurred approximately $2,000,000 in cost overruns on several large customer environmental test chambers during 2017. These cost overruns are not expected to recur in future periods. Finally, CSZ's $3,869,000 in higher expenses in 2017 associated with the new direct sales force was not yet offset by a corresponding increase in the amount of revenue and related operating income. We continue to believe that the direct sales force will lead to higher CSZ product revenue in future periods that will generate operating profits in excess of the cost for the direct sales persons.\nResults of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nProduct Revenues. Product revenues for 2016 were $917,600,000 compared with product revenues of $856,445,000 for 2015, an increase of $61,155,000, or 7%. This increase was attributable to the acquisition of CSZ, which we acquired on April 1, 2016, and continued growth in our automotive products, partially offset by lower product revenues from GPT. Revenues for CSZ during 2016 were $51,540,000. Our automotive product revenues were higher during 2016 including higher sales for CCS which increased by $9,778,000, or 2% to $412,053,000, higher sales for automotive Seat Heaters which increased by $21,956,000, or 8% to $293,543,000 and Steering Wheel Heaters which increased by $7,482,000, or 18% to $49,689,000. Product revenues from GPT totaled $18,624,000 which represented a decrease of $27,254,000, or 59%. This decrease partly reflects continued softness in the demand for GPT's products in North America, which continues to be unfavorably impacted by the market weakness in the oil industry that has carried over to and reduced capital investments being made by GPT's principal customers that build and operate natural gas pipelines and related natural gas exploration and production companies. During 2015, this weakness had been offset by higher sales of products that are sold into geographical markets outside of GPT's home market of North America. However, these are typically larger custom products which are more impacted by the timing of shipments which favor some periods over others. Fewer of these custom systems were shipped during 2016.\nOur 2015 product revenues were negatively affected by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro when compared to 2016 product revenues.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales increased to $622,563,000 in 2016 from $580,066,000 in 2015. This increase of $42,497,000, or 7%, was due to was due to increased sales volume, including the new product revenues from CSZ, higher overhead for our new production facilities in Vietnam and Macedonia and a one-time $3,973,000 expense from the purchase accounting effect of inventory for the CSZ acquisition. The gross margin percentage was 32.2% during 2016. This amount would have been 32.5% without the impact of the one-time purchase accounting impact for CSZ which is 0.2% higher than the gross margin percentage of 32.3% during 2015. The higher gross margin was due to the CSZ revenue, which has a higher than average gross margin percentage, and a favorable foreign currency impact on production expenses. These were offset partially by the lower GPT revenue, which also has a higher than average gross margin percentage.\nNet Research and Development Expenses. Net research and development expenses were $72,923,000 during 2016 compared to $59,604,000 in 2015, an increase of $13,319,000, or 22%. This increase was primarily driven by higher costs for additional resources,\nincluding personnel, focused on application engineering for new production programs of existing products, development of new products and a program to develop the next generation of seat comfort products. New product development includes automotive cooled storage devices, automotive interior thermal management devices, medical thermal management devices, battery thermal management devices, battery management systems, advanced automotive electronics solutions and other potential products. The CSZ acquisition also increased our net research and development expenses by $1,856,000.\nIncreases in research and development were partially offset by research and development reimbursement totaling $6,660,000 during 2016 and $9,607,000 during 2015.\nWe classify development and prototype costs and related reimbursements as research and development. This is consistent with accounting standards applied in the automotive industry. Depreciation costs for tooling are included in cost of sales.\nAcquisition Transaction Expenses. During 2016, we incurred $743,000 in fees and expenses associated with the acquisition of CSZ which was completed on April 1, 2016. During 2015, we did not incur any acquisition transaction expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $115,252,000,"}
