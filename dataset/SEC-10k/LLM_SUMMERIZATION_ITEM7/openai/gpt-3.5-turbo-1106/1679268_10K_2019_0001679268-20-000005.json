Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations, estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are an integrated, growth-oriented company serving both the electric utility and oil and gas industries in North America. Our primary business objective is to grow our operations and create value for stockholders through organic growth opportunities and accretive acquisitions. Our suite of services includes infrastructure services, pressure pumping services, natural sand proppant services, drilling services and other services, which includes coil tubing, equipment rental, full service transportation, crude oil hauling, remote accommodations, oilfield equipment manufacturing and infrastructure engineering and design services. Our infrastructure services division provides construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services to the electrical infrastructure industry. Our pressure pumping services division provides hydraulic fracturing, sand hauling and water transfer services. Our natural sand proppant services division mines, processes and sells natural sand proppant used for hydraulic fracturing. Our drilling services division currently provides rental equipment, such as mud motors and operational tools, for both vertical and horizontal drilling as well as rig moving services. In addition to these service divisions, we also provide coil tubing services, pressure control services, equipment rentals, full service transportation, crude oil hauling services, remote accommodations, oilfield equipment manufacturing and infrastructure engineering and design services. We believe that the services we offer play a critical role in maintaining and improving electrical infrastructure as well as in increasing the ultimate recovery and present value of production streams from unconventional resources. Our complementary suite of services provides us with the opportunity to cross-sell our services and expand our customer base and geographic positioning.\nOur transformation towards an industrial based company is ongoing. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we began infrastructure engineering operations focused on the transmission and distribution industry and also commenced oilfield equipment manufacturing operations. The startup of oilfield equipment manufacturing operations provides us with the ability to repair much of our existing equipment in-house, as well as the option to manufacture certain new equipment we may need in the future. The oilfield equipment manufacturing operations will initially serve our internal needs for our water transfer and equipment rental businesses, but we expect to expand into third party sales in the future. We are continuing to explore other opportunities to expand our business lines as we shift to a broader industrial focus.\nOn November 24, 2014, Mammoth Energy Holdings LLC, or Mammoth Holdings, Gulfport Energy Corporation, or Gulfport, and Rhino Exploration LLC, or Rhino, contributed to the Company their respective interests in the following entities: Bison Drilling and Field Services, LLC, or Bison Drilling; Bison Trucking LLC, or Bison Trucking; White Wing Tubular Services LLC, or White Wing; Barracuda Logistics LLC, or Barracuda; Panther Drilling Systems LLC, or Panther Drilling; Redback Energy Services LLC, or Redback Energy Services; Redback Coil Tubing LLC, or Redback Coil Tubing; Muskie Proppant LLC, or Muskie Proppant; Stingray Pressure Pumping LLC, or Pressure Pumping; Stingray Logistics LLC, or Logistics; and Great White Sand Tiger Lodging Ltd., or Sand Tiger. Upon completion of these contributions, Mammoth Holdings, Gulfport and Rhino beneficially owned a 68.7%, 30.5% and 0.8% equity interest, respectively, in the Partnership. Subsequently, the Partnership formed Redback Pumpdown Services LLC, or Pumpdown, Mr. Inspections LLC, or Mr. Inspections, Silverback Energy Services LLC, or Silverback, and Mammoth Inc. as wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nOn October 12, 2016, prior to and in connection with the IPO, the Partnership converted to a Delaware limited liability company named Mammoth Energy Partners LLC, or Mammoth LLC, and Mammoth Holdings, Gulfport and Rhino contributed their respective membership interests in Mammoth LLC to us in exchange for shares of our common stock, and Mammoth LLC became our wholly-owned subsidiary.\nOn October 19, 2016, Mammoth Inc. closed its IPO of 7,750,000 shares of common stock, of which 7,500,000 shares were sold by Mammoth Inc. and the remaining 250,000 shares were sold by certain selling stockholders, at a price to the public of $15.00 per share. Mammoth Inc.'s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol TUSK.\u201d Mammoth Inc. was formed in June 2016, and did not conduct any material business operations prior to the completion of the IPO and the contribution described below completed on October 12, 2016 immediately prior to the IPO. Prior to the IPO, Mammoth Inc. was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership.\nOn June 5, 2017, we acquired Sturgeon Acquisitions LLC, or Sturgeon, and Sturgeon's wholly owned subsidiaries Taylor Frac, LLC, or Taylor Frac, Taylor Real Estate Investments, LLC, or Taylor Real Estate, and South River Road, LLC, or South River Road. Prior to the acquisition, we and Sturgeon were under common control and, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, we have accounted for this acquisition in a manner similar to the pooling of interest method of accounting. Therefore, our historical financial information for all periods included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been recast to combine Sturgeon's financial results with our financial results as if the acquisition had been effective since Sturgeon commenced operations.\nOur revenues, operating (loss) income and identifiable assets are primarily attributable to four reportable segments: infrastructure services; pressure pumping services; natural sand proppant services; and drilling services. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we identified three reportable segments consisting of infrastructure services, pressure pumping services and natural sand proppant services. Based on our assessment of FASB ASC 280, Segment Reporting, guidance at December 31, 2019, we changed our reportable segment presentation in 2019 to include drilling services, which includes Bison Drilling, Bison Trucking, Panther Drilling, Mako Acquisitions and White Wing Tubular, as its own reportable segment. Segment evaluation is determined on a quantitative basis based on a function of operating income (loss), as well as a qualitative basis, such as nature of the product and service offerings and types of customers. The results of operations for 2018 and 2017 below have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this change in reportable segments.\nSince the dates presented below, we have conducted our operations

maximum leverage ratio (4.0 to 1.0). As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the financial covenants under our revolving credit facility. However, we believe that our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing four fiscal quarters would have resulted in a breach of the maximum leverage ratio and/or the interest coverage ratio as early as the end of the first quarter of 2020 if we did not receive payments due from PREPA before the end of such quarter. As we believe that such payments from PREPA are unlikely to be received by March 31, 2020, on February 26, 2020, we amended our revolving credit facility to, among other things, (i) amend our financial covenants, (ii) decrease the maximum revolving advance amount from $185 million to $130 million, (iii) decrease the amount that the maximum revolving advance can be increased to (the accordion) from $350 million to $180 million, (iv) increase the applicable margin ranges from 2.00% to 2.50% per annum in the case of the alternate base rate and from 3.00% to 3.50% per annum in the case of LIBOR, (v) increase the aggregate amount of permitted asset dispositions, and (vi) permit certain sale-leaseback transactions.

We offer a broad range of services on electric transmission and distribution, or T&D, networks and substation facilities, which include construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair of high voltage transmission lines, substations and lower voltage overhead and underground distribution systems. Our commercial services include the installation, maintenance and repair of commercial wiring. We also provide storm repair and restoration services in response to storms and\nother disasters. We provide infrastructure services primarily in the northeast, southwest and midwest portions of the United States.\nWe currently have agreements in place with private utilities, public IOUs and Co-Ops. Since we commenced operations in this line of business, substantially all of our infrastructure revenues has been generated from storm restoration work, primarily from PREPA, due to damage caused by Hurricane Maria. On October 19, 2017, Cobra Acquisitions LLC, or Cobra, and PREPA entered into an emergency master services agreement for repairs to PREPA's electrical grid. The one-year contract, as amended, provided for payments of up to $945 million. On May 26, 2018, Cobra and PREPA entered into a second one-year, $900 million master services agreement to provide additional repair services and begin the initial phase of reconstruction of the electrical power system in Puerto Rico. Our work under each of the contracts with PREPA ended on March 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019, PREPA owed us approximately $227 million for services we performed, excluding $42 million of interest charged on these delinquent balances as of December 31, 2019. See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Accounts Receivable to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. PREPA is currently subject to bankruptcy proceedings, which were filed in July 2017 and are currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. As a result, PREPA's ability to meet its payment obligations under the contracts is largely dependent upon funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency or other sources. On September 30, 2019, we filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico seeking recovery of the amounts owed to us by PREPA. PREPA filed a motion to stay our motion on the ground that the ongoing criminal proceedings described below against the former president of Cobra and two other individuals may affect our recovery of those amounts. On October 17, 2019, the court granted PREPA's request to stay our motion and, on February 3, 2020, extended the stay until a status conference to be held on June 17, 2020. In the event PREPA (i) does not have or does not obtain the funds necessary to satisfy its obligations to Cobra under the contracts, (ii) obtains the necessary funds but refuses to pay the amounts owed to us or (iii) otherwise does not pay amounts owed to us for services performed, the receivable may not be collected and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, government contracts are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits and compliance reviews by government agencies and representatives. In this regard, on September 10, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico unsealed an indictment that charged the former president of Cobra with conspiracy, wire fraud, false statements and disaster fraud. Two other individuals were also charged in the indictment. The indictment is focused on the interactions between a former FEMA official and the former President of Cobra. Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries were charged in the indictment. We are continuing to cooperate with the related investigation. We are also subject to investigations and legal proceedings related to our contracts with PREPA. Given the uncertainty inherent in the criminal litigation, investigations and legal proceedings, it is not possible at this time to determine the potential outcome or other potential impacts that they could have on us. See Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information regarding these investigations and proceedings. Further, as noted above, our contracts with PREPA have concluded and we have not obtained, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain, one or more contracts with PREPA or other customers to replace the level of services that we provided to PREPA under our previous contracts.\nSince the completion of our work in Puerto Rico on March 31, 2019, we focused on right-sizing our infrastructure operations and performing required maintenance on our equipment, which had been subjected to harsh working conditions. This process, with its associated costs, was completed during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nDemand for our infrastructure services in the continental United States has increased since we began operations in 2017. We had a total of approximately 140 transmission and distribution crews as of December 31, 2019, as compared to approximately 105 at December 31, 2018 and approximately 50 at December 31, 2017. Transmission crew size varies based upon the scope of the project and factors such as voltage, structure type, number of conductors and type of foundation. Each distribution crew generally consists of five employees. These transmission and distribution crews are working for multiple utilities primarily across the northeastern, midwestern and southwestern portions of the United States. We recently hired a new president for our infrastructure division and have added experienced industry personnel to key management positions. With this team in place, we believe we will be able to grow our customer base and increase our revenues in the continental United States over the coming years. We also believe that the skill sets and experience of our crews will afford us enhanced bidding opportunities in both the U.S. and overseas.\nOil and Natural Gas Industry\nThe oil and natural gas industry has traditionally been volatile and is influenced by a combination of long-term, short-term and cyclical trends, including the domestic and international supply and demand for oil and natural gas, current and expected future prices for oil and natural gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices, production depletion\nrates and the resultant levels of cash flows generated and allocated by exploration and production companies to their drilling, completion and related services and products budget. The oil and natural gas industry is also impacted by general domestic and international economic conditions, political instability in oil producing countries, government regulations (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of customer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity and other conditions and factors that are beyond our control.\nDemand for most of our oil and natural gas products and services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. The levels of capital expenditures of our customers are predominantly driven by the prices of oil and natural gas. Over the past several years, commodity prices, particularly oil, has seen significant volatility with pricing ranging from a high of $110.53 per barrel on September 6, 2013 to a low of $26.19 per barrel on February 11, 2016. During 2019, oil prices fluctuated between a low of $45.41 on January 1, 2019 and a high of $66.30 on April 23, 2019, and averaged $57.03 per barrel for the year. Certain factors related to world politics and major oil producers caused fluctuations in the oil price during 2019. However, overall, the price of oil stayed relatively stable throughout the year.\nWe anticipate demand for our oil and natural gas services and products will continue to be dependent on the level of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry and, ultimately, commodity prices. We experienced a weakening in demand for our oilfield services beginning in the third quarter of 2019, which continued throughout the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of budget exhaustion and capital discipline from our customers. In addition, other factors, including access to capital and the need to refinance or repay maturing debt, have had a significant influence on some of our customers' capital budgets and activity levels. While we still expect commodity prices to be the primary driver of capex spending and industry activity levels in the future, other factors may play a significant role in the ultimate level of capex spending by the companies that use our completion and production, natural sand proppant and directional drilling businesses.\nDuring 2019, we experienced lower utilization rates and pricing for our oil and natural gas services, including our pressure pumping, contract drilling, coil tubing and directional drilling equipment and services, as compared to 2018. Further, in response to market conditions, in July 2019 we temporarily shut down our cementing and acidizing operations and flowback operations. Additionally, in December 2019 we temporarily shut down our contract drilling operations. We continue to monitor the market to determine if and when we can recommence these services. Based on current feedback from our exploration and production customers, we expect them to take a cautious approach to activity levels in 2020 given the recent volatility in oil prices and investor sentiment calling for activities to remain within or below cash flows. Market fundamentals are challenging for our oil field businesses. Although we believe the reported retirement of equipment across the industry is beginning to help the market, pricing and utilization for our oil field businesses are, and are expected to remain depressed for the foreseeable future. We intend to closely monitor our cost structure in response to market conditions and pursue cost savings where possible. Further, a significant portion of our revenue from our pressure pumping business is derived from Gulfport pursuant to a contract that expires in December 2021. On December 28, 2019, Gulfport filed a lawsuit alleging our breach of this contract and seeking to terminate the contract and recover damages for alleged overpayments, audit costs and legal fees. We believe this action is without merit and will vigorously defend the lawsuit. However, the termination of our relationship with Gulfport, or nonrenewal of our contract with Gulfport, or one or more of our other customers, if not replaced with comparable or greater levels of service from other customers, would result in lower utilization rates for our pressure pumping equipment and, as a result, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nNatural Sand Proppant Industry\nIn the natural sand proppant industry, demand growth for frac sand and other proppants is primarily driven by advancements in oil and natural gas drilling and well completion technology and techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, as well as overall industry activity growth.\nIn 2018 and 2019, several new and existing suppliers completed planned capacity additions of frac sand supply, particularly in the Permian Basin. The industry expansion, coupled with increased capital discipline and budget exhaustion, caused the frac sand market to become oversupplied, particularly in finer grades, during the second half of 2019. With the frac sand market oversupplied, pricing for certain grades has fallen significantly from the peaks experienced throughout 2018 and during the first half of 2019. This oversupply resulted in several industry participants idling and closing high cost mines in an attempt to restore the supply and demand balance and reduce the number of industry participants. Nevertheless, demand for our sand declined significantly in the second half of 2019 as a result of increased capital discipline by our customers and budget exhaustion, among other factors. We cannot predict if and when demand and pricing will recover sufficiently to return our natural sand proppant services segment to profitability.\nDuring the first half of 2018, constraints in the rail system adversely impacted frac sand deliveries from our Taylor sand facility in Jackson County, Wisconsin. As a result, we estimate production at our Taylor facility was 23% lower during the\nfirst half of 2018 than it would have been in the absence of these constraints. These rail system constraints were largely alleviated during the third quarter of 2018 and we do not believe they had an impact on our operations in 2019. Production at our Piranha facility was not impacted by these rail constraints.\nFurther, as a result of adverse market conditions, production at our Muskie sand facility in Pierce County, Wisconsin has been temporarily idled since September 2018. Our Taylor sand facility in Taylor, Wisconsin and Piranha sand facility in New Auburn, Wisconsin are currently running at 20% to 25% capacity. Our contracted capacity has provided a strong baseline of business, which has kept our Taylor and Piranha plants operating and our costs low. Our blended production costs have declined 24% from $15.54 during 2018 to $11.82 during 2019.\nOur subsidiary Muskie Proppant is a party to a contract with Gulfport under which we sell and deliver specified amounts of sand to Gulfport. The agreement, as amended, has a term ending in December 2021.

Revenue for 2019 decreased $1.1 billion, or 63%, to $625 million from $1.7 billion for 2018. The decline in total revenue is primarily attributable to a $868 million decrease in infrastructure services revenue, representing 81% of the overall decrease. Additionally, pressure pumping services and natural sand proppant services revenue decreased $123 million and $68 million, respectively, representing 12% and 6% of the overall decrease. Revenue derived from related parties was $130 million, or 21% of our total revenue, for 2019 and $143 million, or 8% of our total revenue, for 2018. Substantially all of our related party revenue is derived from Gulfport under pressure pumping and sand contracts. Revenue by division was as follows:\nInfrastructure Services. Infrastructure services division revenue decreased $868 million, or 80%, to $214 million for 2019 from $1.1 billion for 2018 primarily due to the conclusion on March 31, 2019 of the work we performed under our contracts with PREPA for repairs to Puerto Rico's electrical grid as a result of Hurricane Maria. For additional information regarding our contracts with PREPA and our infrastructure services, see Overview of Our Industries - Electrical Infrastructure Industry\u201d above. Revenue from our operations in the continental United States increased $58 million, or 96%, to $118 million for 2019 from $60 million for 2018.\nPressure Pumping Services. Pressure pumping services division revenue decreased $123 million, or 33%, to $246 million for 2019 from $369 million for 2018. Revenue derived from related parties was $91 million, or 37% of total pressure pumping revenue, for 2019 and $96 million, or 26% of total pressure pumping revenue, for 2018. Substantially all of our related party revenue is derived from Gulfport under a pressure pumping contract. For additional information regarding the status of this contract, see Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. Intersegment revenue, consisting primarily of revenue derived from our sand segment, totaled $4 million and $7 million, respectively, for 2019 and 2018.\nThe decrease in our pressure pumping services revenue was primarily driven by a decline in pricing as well as a decline in utilization. The number of stages completed decreased 14% to 5,378 for 2019 from 6,245 for 2018. An average of 2.4 of our fleets were active throughout 2019 compared to 3.6 fleets for 2018.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services. Natural sand proppant services division revenue decreased $68 million, or 40%, to $100 million for 2019, from $168 million for 2018. Revenue derived from related parties was $28 million, or 28% of total sand revenue, for 2019 and $25 million, or 15% of total sand revenue, for 2018. All of our related party revenue is derived from Gulfport under a contract effective through December 31, 2021. Intersegment revenue, consisting primarily of revenue derived from our pressure pumping segment, totaled $30 million, or 30% of total sand revenue, for 2019 and $67 million, or 40% of total sand revenue, for 2018.\nThe decrease in our natural sand proppant services revenue was primarily attributable to a 25% decline in tons of sand sold from approximately 2.7 million tons in 2018 to 2.0 million tons in 2019 coupled with a 24% decline in average price per ton of sand sold from $39.16 in 2018 to $29.70 in 2019.\nDrilling Services. Drilling services division revenue decreased $35 million, or 52%, to $32 million for 2019, from $67 million for 2018. Revenue derived from related parties, consisting primarily of directional drilling revenue from El Toro Resources LLC, was $1 million for each of 2019 and 2018. The decline in our drilling services revenue was primarily attributable to decreases in revenue for our contract land drilling and directional drilling businesses of $19 million and $11 million, respectively, due to declines in utilization. Our average active rigs decreased from 4.3 in 2018 to 1.4 in 2019. Directional drilling utilization declined from 49% in 2018 to 30% in 2019.\nOther Services. Revenue from other services, consisting of revenue derived from our coil tubing, pressure control, flowback, cementing, acidizing, equipment rental, crude oil hauling, full service transportation and remote accommodation businesses, decreased $15 million, or 18%, to $69 million for 2019 from $84 million for 2018. Revenue derived from related parties, consisting primarily of equipment rental and cementing revenue from Gulfport, was $9 million, or 13% of total other services revenue, for 2019 and $21 million, or 25% of total other services revenue, for 2018. Intersegment revenue, consisting primarily of revenue derived from our infrastructure and pressure pumping segments, totaled $2 million and $6 million, respectively, for 2019 and 2018.\nThe decrease in other services revenue was primarily due to a decline in utilization from 39% in 2018 to 17% in 2019 for our coil tubing business. Additionally, due to market conditions, we temporarily shut down our cementing and acidizing operations as well as our flowback operations during the third quarter of 2019 resulting in a decline in revenue. We continue to monitor market conditions to evaluate if and when we can recommence providing these services. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in activity for our equipment rental business. An average\nof 557 pieces of equipment were rented during 2019, an increase of 41% from 395 pieces of equipment rented during 2018.\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expense). Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expense, decreased $550 million from $1.1 billion, or 65% of total revenue, for 2018 to $544 million, or 87% of total revenue, for 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in activity across all business lines. Cost of revenue by operating division was as follows:\nInfrastructure Services. Infrastructure services division cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense, decreased $439 million from $611 million for 2018 to $172 million for 2019. The decline is due to the conclusion on March 31, 2019 of the work we performed under our contracts with PREPA for repairs to Puerto Rico's electrical grid as a result of Hurricane Maria. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense of $31 million in 2019 and $20 million in 2018, was 80% and 56%, respectively, for 2019 and 2018.\nPressure Pumping Services. Pressure pumping services division cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense, decreased $84 million, or 29%, from $294 million for 2018 to $210 million for 2019 primarily due to a decline in activity. As a percentage of revenue, our pressure pumping services division cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense of $40 million in 2019 and $51 million in 2018, was 85% and 79%, respectively, for 2019 and 2018. The increase in costs as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a decline in utilization.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services. Natural sand proppant services division cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation, depletion and accretion expense, decreased $43 million, or 32%, from $133 million for 2018 to $90 million for 2019 primarily due to a decrease in cost of goods sold as well as a 24% decline in production costs per ton of sand. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation, depletion and accretion expense of $14 million in both 2019 and 2018, was 91% and 79%, respectively, for 2019 and 2018. The increase in cost as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to a 24% decline in average price per ton of sand sold.\nDrilling Services. Drilling services division cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense, decreased $24 million, or 39%, from $61 million for 2018 to $37 million for 2019 primarily due a decline in activity for our contract land drilling and directional drilling businesses. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense of $13 million in 2019 and $18 million in 2018, was 114% and 91%, respectively, for 2019 and 2018. The increase is primarily due to an increase in labor-related costs as a percentage of revenue.\nOther Services. Other services cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense, decreased $4 million, or 5%, from $76 million for 2018 to $72 million for 2019 primarily due to a decline in costs for our coil tubing business as a result of reduced activity. Additionally, due to market conditions, we temporarily shut down our cementing and acidizing operations as well as our flowback operations during the third quarter of 2019 resulting in a decline in cost of revenue. We continue to monitor market conditions to evaluate if and when we can recommence providing these services. These declines were partially offset by an increase in costs for our equipment rental and crude oil hauling businesses. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense of $18 million and $16 million in 2019 and 2018, was 104% and 91%, respectively, for 2019 and 2018.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, represent the costs associated with managing and supporting our operations. Following is a breakout of SG&A expenses for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 251: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services\n</td> <td>17,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(a)\n</td> <td>10,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash SG&A expense\n</td> <td>46,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bad debt provision(b)\n</td> <td>1,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,578\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity based compensation(c)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock based compensation\n</td> <td>3,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-cash SG&A expense\n</td> <td>4,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total SG&A expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 252: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>a.\n</td> <td>Includes travel-related costs, IT expenses, rent, utilities and other general and administrative-related costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 253: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>b.\n</td> <td>During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received payment for amounts previously reserved in 2017.

Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion decreased $3 million, or 2%, to $117 million for 2019 from $120 million in 2018. The decrease is primarily due to a decline in intangible asset amortization expense partially offset by an increase in property and equipment depreciation expense.\nImpairment of Goodwill. We recorded impairment of goodwill of $34 million and $3 million, respectively, in 2019 and 2018. As a result of our annual assessment of goodwill, we determined that the carrying value of goodwill for certain of our entities exceeded their fair values at December 31, 2019, resulting in impairment expense of $30 million. During 2019, we temporarily shut down our cementing and acidizing operations, resulting in impairment of goodwill totaling $3 million. We recorded expense of $3 million in 2018 related to impairment of goodwill as a result of the movement of certain cementing equipment from the Utica Shale to the Permian Basin.\nImpairment of Other Long-lived Assets. We recorded impairments of other long-lived assets of $7 million and $6 million, respectively, in 2019 and 2018. During 2019, we temporarily shut down our our flowback operations, resulting in fixed asset impairments of $4 million during 2019. Additionally, we recorded impairment expense $3 million related to specified drilling rigs and $1 million related to WTL's customer relationship intangible asset during 2019. We recorded impairment expense of $4 million related to specified drilling rigs in 2018 and $1 million related to impairment of intangible assets as a result of the movement of certain cementing equipment from the Utica shale to the Permian basin.\nOperating (Loss) Income. Operating income decreased $522 million to an operating loss of $128 million for 2019 compared to operating income of $394 million for 2018. The decrease is primarily due to a $438 million decline in operating income for our infrastructure services division due to a decline in activity.\nInterest Expense, net. Interest expense, net increased $2 million to $5 million during 2019 compared to $3 million during 2018 primarily due to an increase in average borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nOther Income (Expense), net. Other income, net increased $44 million during 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the recognition of interest on trade accounts receivable totaling $42 million pursuant to the terms of our contracts with PREPA.\nIncome Taxes. During 2019, we recorded an income tax benefit of $12 million on pre-tax loss of $91 million compared to income tax expense of $153 million on pre-tax income of $389 million for 2018. Our effective tax rate was 13.3% for 2019 compared to 39.4% for 2018. Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, as well as discrete items, such as return to provision adjustments, goodwill impairment and equity based compensation that may not be consistent from year to year. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding our change in tax expense.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nTable 255: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Infrastructure services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,082,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>224,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pressure pumping services\n</td> <td>369,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>279,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural sand proppant services\n</td> <td>168,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Drilling services\n</td> <td>66,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other services\n</td> <td>83,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations\n</td> <td>(80,417\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31,567\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>1,690,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>691,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Infrastructure services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $20,485 and $3,181, respectively, for 2018 and 2017)\n</td> <td>610,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pressure pumping services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $51,417 and $45,381, respectively, for 2018 and 2017)\n</td> <td>293,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>211,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural sand proppant services (exclusive of depreciation, depletion and accretion of $13,512 and $9,389, respectively, for 2018 and 2017)\n</td> <td>132,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Drilling services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $18,229 and $19,630, respectively, for 2018 and 2017)\n</td> <td>60,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $16,151 and $14,494, respectively, for 2018 and 2017)\n</td> <td>76,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations\n</td> <td>(80,390\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31,532\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>1,093,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>482,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>73,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion\n</td> <td>119,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill\n</td> <td>3,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of other long-lived assets\n</td> <td>5,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>394,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(3,187\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,310\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bargain purchase gain\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>(2,036\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(677\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>389,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>153,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue.

Pressure pumping services division revenue increased $90 million, or 32%, to $369 million for 2018 from $279 million for 2017. Revenue derived from related parties was $96 million, or 26% of total pressure pumping revenue, for 2018 and $144 million, or 52% of total pressure pumping revenue, for 2017. Substantially all of our related party revenue was derived from Gulfport under a pressure pumping contract. For additional information regarding the status of this contract, see Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. Intersegment revenue, consisting primarily of revenue derived from our sand segment, was $7 million and $2 million, respectively, for 2018 and 2017.\nThe increase in our pressure pumping services revenue was primarily driven by the startup of our fourth, fifth and sixth pressure pumping fleets in June, August and October 2017, respectively, in the SCOOP/STACK and Permian Basin, which contributed revenues of $148 million in 2018 compared to $100 million in 2017. Additionally, the number of stages completed increased to 6,245 for 2018 from 5,139 for 2017.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services. Natural sand proppant services division revenue increased $51 million, or 44%, to $168 million for 2018, from $117 million for 2017. Revenue derived from related parties was $25 million, or 15% of total sand revenues, for 2018 and $43 million, or 37% of total sand revenues, for 2017. Substantially all of our related party revenue was derived from Gulfport under a contract effective through December 31, 2021. Intersegment revenue, consisting primarily of revenue derived from our pressure pumping segment, was $67 million, or 40% of total sand revenue, for 2018 and $27 million, or 23% of total sand revenue, for 2017.\nThe increase in our natural sand proppant services revenue was primarily attributable to a 59% increase in tons of sand sold from approximately 1.7 million tons in 2017 to 2.7 million tons in 2018. In May 2017, we acquired a wet and dry plant and sand mine located on approximately 600 acres in New Auburn, Wisconsin through our purchase of the assets of Chieftain. These assets contributed revenue of $38 million to our natural sand proppant services division in 2018 compared to $23 million in 2017.\nDrilling Services. Drilling services division revenue increased $16 million, or 31%, to $67 million for 2018, from $51 million for 2017. Revenue derived from related parties, consisting primarily of directional drilling revenue from Gulfport and El Toro Resources LLC, was $1 million and $4 million, respectively, for 2018 and 2017. Revenue for our directional drilling services increased $13 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in utilization from 27% in 2017 to 49% in 2018.\nOther Services. Revenue from other services, consisting of revenue derived from our coil tubing, pressure control, flowback, cementing, equipment rental and remote accommodation businesses, increased $32 million, or 62%, to $84 million for 2018 from $52 million for 2017. Revenue derived from related parties, consisting primarily of equipment rental and cementing revenue from Gulfport, was $21 million, or 25% of total other services revenue, for 2018 and $18 million, or 35% of total other services revenue, for 2017. Intersegment revenue, consisting primarily of revenue derived from our infrastructure and pressure pumping segments, was $6 million and $2 million, respectively for 2018 and 2017.\nRevenue for Stingray Cementing and Stingray Energy, which we acquired in June 2017, increased $16 million for 2018 compared to 2017. During the second quarter of 2018, we acquired RTS, a cementing and acidizing business, and WTL, a crude oil hauling business. These businesses contributed revenue of $14 million during 2018. Revenue from our coil tubing, pressure control and flowback services increased $7 million for 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increases in utilization. These increases were partially offset by a $6 million decrease in revenue from our remote accommodations business due to a decline in utilization.\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion). Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expense, increased $611 million from $483 million, or 70% of total revenue, for 2017 to $1.1 billion, or 65% of total revenue, for 2018. The increase was primarily due to an expansion of our service offerings into the infrastructure services business, which represented a $489 million increase in cost of revenue, as well as an increase in pressure pumping division costs of $83 million, primarily related to the addition of three new fleets in 2017. Cost of revenue by division was as follows:\nInfrastructure Services. Infrastructure services division cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense, increased $489 million from $122 million for 2017 to $611 million for 2018. The increase is due to the expansion of our infrastructure business in late 2017 and 2018. The largest components of our cost of revenue include labor-related costs, contract labor and travel, meals and lodging expense. As a percentage of revenue,\ncost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense of $20 million in 2018 and $3 million in 2017, was 56% and 54%, respectively, for 2018 and 2017.\nPressure Pumping Services. Pressure pumping services division cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense, increased $83 million, or 39%, from $211 million for 2017 to $294 million for 2018. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of services into the SCOOP/STACK and Permian Basin with the addition of three fleets in 2017. As a percentage of revenue, our pressure pumping services division cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense of $51 million in 2018 and $45 million in 2017, was 79% and 76%, respectively, for 2018 and 2017. The increase in costs as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to an increase in cost of goods sold as a result of selling sand with our service package to customers in the mid-continent region.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services. Natural sand proppant services division cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation, depletion and accretion expense, increased $40 million, or 43%, from $93 million for 2017 to $133 million for 2018 primarily due to an increase in cost of goods sold as a result of a 59% increase in tons of sand sold in 2018 compared to 2017, partially offset by a decrease in production costs per ton of sand in 2018. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation, depletion and accretion expense of $14 million in 2018 and $9 million in 2017, was 79% for both 2018 and 2017.\nDrilling Services. Drilling services cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense, increased $14 million, or 30%, from $47 million for 2017 to $61 million for 2018 primarily due to an increase in costs for our directional drilling business due to increased utilization. As a percentage of revenue, our drilling services division cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense of $18 million in 2018 and $20 million in 2017, was 91% and 93%, respectively, for 2018 and 2017.\nOther Services. Other services cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense, increased $34 million, or 81%, from $42 million for 2017 to $76 million for 2018, primarily due to the acquisition of Stingray Cementing and Stingray Energy, partially offset by a decline in costs for our remote accommodations business and declines in labor-related costs and repairs and maintenance expense for our coil tubing and flowback businesses. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense of $16 million in 2018 and $14 million in 2017, was 91% and 81%, respectively, for 2018 and 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses represent the costs associated with managing and supporting our operations. These expenses increased $23 million, or 47%, to $73 million for 2018, from $50 million for 2017. Following is a breakout of SG&A expenses for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 256: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services\n</td> <td>11,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(a)\n</td> <td>10,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash SG&A expense\n</td> <td>65,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bad debt provision(b)\n</td> <td>(14,578\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity based compensation(c)\n</td> <td>17,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock based compensation\n</td> <td>4,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-cash SG&A expense\n</td> <td>7,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total SG&A expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 257: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>a.\n</td> <td>Includes travel-related costs, IT expenses, rent, utilities and other general and administrative-related costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 258: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>b.\n</td> <td>During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received payment for amounts reserved in 2017.

Depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization increased $28 million, or 30%, to $120 million for 2018 from $92 million in 2017. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in\nproperty and equipment purchases in the second half of 2017 and 2018, resulting in increased depreciation expense. Additionally, depletion expense increased in 2018 as a result of the Chieftain assets purchased in 2017.\nImpairment of Goodwill. We recorded expense of $3 million in 2018 related to impairment of goodwill as a result of the movement of certain cementing equipment from the Utica Shale to the Permian Basin.\nImpairment of Other Long-lived Assets. We recorded an impairment of other long-lived assets of $6 million in 2018, of which $4 million related to specified drilling rigs and $1 million related to impairment of intangible assets as a result of the movement of certain cementing equipment from the Utica Shale to the Permian Basin. Impairments were $4 million in 2017, primarily related to specified drilling rig assets.\nOperating Income (Loss). Operating income increased $331 million, or 525%, to $394 million for 2018 compared to $63 million for 2017. The increase was primarily the result of an expansion of our infrastructure businesses, which accounted for $346 million of the increase in operating income and a $9 million increase in natural sand proppant operating income. These were partially offset by a $19 million decrease in pressure pumping operating income primarily due to the recognition of non-cash equity compensation expense during 2018.\nInterest Expense, net. Interest expense, net decreased $1 million, or 26%, to $3 million during 2018 compared to $4 million during 2017. The decline in interest expense was attributable to a decrease in average borrowings on our credit facility during 2018 compared to 2017.\nBargain Purchase Gain. The purchase of the Chieftain assets resulted in a bargain purchase gain of $4 million for 2017. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for more information.\nOther Expense, net. Non-operating charges resulted in other expense, net, of $2 million for 2018 compared to $1 million for 2017. The 2018 amount included $1 million of loss on the disposal of assets during the period compared to a nominal loss for 2017.\nIncome Taxes. During 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $153 million on pre-tax income of $389 million compared to income tax expense of $3 million on pre-tax loss of $62 million for 2017. Our effective tax rate was 39.4% for 2018 and 4.9% for 2017. 2017 included the recognition of a $31 million credit related to the Tax Act enacted in 2017. Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, as well as discrete items, such as equity based compensation that may not be consistent from year to year. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding our change in tax expense.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion, impairment of long-lived assets, inventory obsolescence charges, acquisition related costs, public offering costs, equity based compensation, stock based compensation, bargain purchase gain, interest expense, net, other (income) expense, net (which is comprised of the (gain) or loss on disposal of long-lived assets and interest on delinquent accounts receivable) and provision (benefit) for income taxes, further adjusted to add back interest on trade accounts receivable. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industries depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a widely followed measure of operating performance and may also be used by investors to measure our ability to meet debt service requirements.\nThe following tables also provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP financial measure of net income or (loss) for each of our operating segments for the specified periods (in thousands).\nConsolidated\nTable

The decrease in operating cash flows from 2018 to 2019 was primarily attributable to a decline in activity for our infrastructure services segment as well as a timing difference between cash outflows for income tax payments and cash inflows for accounts receivable. The increase in operating cash flows from 2017 to 2018 was primarily attributable to an increase in net income as a result of the expansion of our infrastructure services business.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $33 million, $212 million and $172 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to net borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $80 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $11 million. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to net repayments under our revolving credit facility of $100 million and cash dividends paid totaling $11 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to net borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $100 million, which was partially offset by the repayment of acquiree debt of $9 million.\nEffect of Foreign Exchange Rate on Cash\nThe effect of foreign exchange rate on cash was $0.1 million, ($0.1) million and a nominal amount, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The year-over-year effect was driven primarily by a favorable (unfavorable) shift in the weakness (strength) of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar for the cash held in Canadian accounts.\nWorking Capital\nOur working capital totaled $277 million and $216 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Our cash balances totaled $6 million and $68 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility\nOn October 19, 2018, we and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries, as borrowers, entered into an amended and restated revolving credit facility with the lenders party thereto and PNC Bank, National Association, as a lender and as administrative agent for the lenders, which among other things, (i) extended the maturity date to October 19, 2023, (ii) increased the maximum revolving advance amount to $185 million, with the ability to further increase the maximum revolving advance amount to $350 million under certain circumstances, (iii) increased the letter of credit sublimit to 20% of the maximum revolving advance amount and (iv) decreased the interest rates applicable to loans. On November 5, 2019, we entered into a first amendment to our amended and restated revolving credit facility, to amend the interest coverage ratio definition to give accrual treatment to certain cash taxes included in the ratio calculation. As a result, certain cash tax payments that were made in 2019 were treated as if they were made in 2018, the year in which the income related to such tax payments was actually received. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the financial covenants under our revolving credit facility. However, we believe that our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing four fiscal quarters would have resulted in a breach of the maximum leverage ratio and/or the interest coverage ratio as early as the end of the first quarter of 2020 if we did not receive payments due from PREPA before the end of such quarter. As we believe that such payments from PREPA are unlikely to be received by March 31, 2020, on February 26, 2020, we further amended our revolving credit facility to, among other things, (i) amend our financial covenants, as outlined below, (ii) decrease the maximum revolving advance amount from $185 million to $130 million, (iii) decrease the amount that the maximum revolving advance can be increased to (the accordion) from $350 million to $180 million, (iv) increase the applicable margin ranges from 2.00% to 2.50% per annum in the case of the alternate base rate and from 3.00% to 3.50% per annum in the case of LIBOR, (v) increase the aggregate amount of permitted asset dispositions, and (vi) permit certain sale-leaseback transactions.\nThe financial covenants under our revolving credit facility were amended as follows:\nTable 277: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 was eliminated;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 278: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the maximum leverage coverage ratio of 4.0 to 1.0 was eliminated for the first two fiscal quarters of 2020 and, beginning with the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2020, changed to 2.5 to 1.0;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 279: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>beginning with the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2020, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.1 to 1.0 was added; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 280: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>from the effective date of February 26, 2020 through September 30, 2020, a minimum excess availability covenant of 10% of the maximum revolving advance amount was added.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to remain in compliance with the covenants contained in our revolving credit facility as amended and restated.

The lenders (i) would not be required to lend any additional amounts to us, (ii) could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable, and (iii) may have the ability to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay our outstanding borrowings.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $80.0 million. At February 26, 2020, we had $87.4 million in borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, leaving an aggregate of $20.6 million of available borrowing capacity under this facility, after giving effect to our recent amendment that (i) reduced the maximum revolving advance amount to $130 million and imposed a minimum excess availability covenant of 10% of the maximum revolving advance amount and (ii) $9.0 million of outstanding letters of credit.\nCapital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity\nDuring 2019, our capital expenditures totaled $36 million and included $6 million in our infrastructure segment primarily related to truck, tooling and equipment purchases for new crews, $15 million in our pressure pumping segment primarily related to various pressure pumping and water transfer equipment, $3 million in our natural sand proppant services segment for various maintenance equipment, $3 million in our drilling services segment primarily for upgrades to our rig fleet and $9 million for our other businesses primarily related to equipment additions for our equipment rental business.\nDuring 2020, we currently estimate that our aggregate capital expenditures will be up to $20 million, depending upon industry conditions and our financial results. These capital expenditures include $8 million in our infrastructure segment for assets for additional crews, $8 million in our pressure pumping segment for conversion of a portion of our fleet to include DGB capabilities, maintenance to our existing pressure pumping fleet and additional water transfer equipment and $4 million for our other divisions, primarily for additional equipment for our rental business. However, if industry conditions remain the same or weaken further, we expect that our capital expenditures for 2020 will be materially less.\nWe believe that our cash on hand, operating cash flow and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables (including receipt of payments from our customers, including PREPA and Gulfport). Further, significant additional capital expenditures could be required to conduct our operations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that operations and other capital resources, including potential sales of assets or businesses, will provide cash in sufficient amounts to meet our operating needs and/or maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures. In addition, while we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities, we do not have a specific acquisition budget for 2020 since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted. We continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities, including transactions involving entities controlled by Wexford and Gulfport. Our acquisitions may be undertaken with cash, our common stock or a combination of cash, common stock and/or other consideration. In the event we make one or more acquisitions and the amount of capital required is greater than the amount we have available for acquisitions at that time, we could be required to reduce the expected level of capital expenditures and/or seek additional capital. If we seek additional capital for that or other reasons, we may do so through borrowings under our revolving credit facility, joint venture partnerships, sale-leaseback transactions, asset sales, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. We cannot assure you that this additional capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain funds we need, our ability to conduct operations, make capital expenditures and/or complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us will be impaired.\nContractual and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 281: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and commitment fees on long-term debt(b)\n</td> <td>13,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (c)\n</td> <td>46,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>881\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing lease obligations(d)\n</td> <td>5,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment financing obligations(e)\n</td> <td>1,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments (f)\n</td> <td>25,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital purchase commitments (g)\n</td> <td>4,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>178,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>881\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 282: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>a.\n</td> <td>Excludes interest payments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 283: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>b.\n</td> <td>Assumption of long-term debt balance outstanding as of December 31, 2019 of $80 million using the weighted average interest rate as of December 31, 2019 of 4.05%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 284: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>c.\n</td> <td>Operating lease obligations primarily relate to rail cars, real estate and other equipment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 285: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>d.\n</td> <td>Financing lease obligations primarily relate to equipment for our infrastructure segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 286: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>e.\n</td> <td>Equipment financing obligations primarily relate to vehicles and other equipment for our pressure pumping segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 287: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>f.\n</td> <td>Purchase commitments are comprised primarily of sand and coil tubing string.

Included in these amounts are sand purchase commitments of $20 million. Pricing for certain sand purchase agreements is variable and, therefore, the total sand purchase commitments could be as much as $23 million. The minimum amount due in the form of shortfall fees under certain sand purchase agreements was $2 million as of December 31, 2019.\nOther Commitments\nSubsequent to December 31, 2019, we ordered additional capital equipment with aggregate commitments of $2 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Below, we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments. We believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. See Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management.\nUse of Estimates. In preparing the financial statements, our management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include but are not limited to the Company's sand reserves and their impact on calculating depletion expense, allowance for doubtful accounts, asset retirement obligations, reserves for self-insurance, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, business combination valuations, amortization of intangible assets, and future cash flows and fair values used to assess recoverability and impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill.\nRevenue Recognition. On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue guidance under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective method applied to contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Revenues for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts continue to be reported under previous revenue recognition guidance. The adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company's primary revenue streams include infrastructure services, pressure pumping services, natural sand proppant services, drilling services and other services, which includes coil tubing, pressure control, flowback, cementing, acidizing, equipment rentals, crude oil hauling, full service transportation and remote accommodations services.\nInfrastructure Services. Infrastructure services are typically provided pursuant to master service agreements, repair and maintenance contracts or fixed price and non-fixed price installation contracts. Pricing under these contracts may be unit priced, cost-plus/hourly (or time and materials basis) or fixed price (or lump sum basis). We account for infrastructure services as a single performance obligation satisfied over time. Revenue is recognized over time as work progresses based on the days completed or as the contract is completed. Under certain customer contracts in our infrastructure services segment, the Company warranties equipment and labor performed for a specified period following substantial completion of the work.\nPressure Pumping Services. Pressure pumping services are typically provided based upon a purchase order, contract or on a spot market basis. Services are provided on a day rate, contracted or hourly basis. Generally, we account for pressure pumping services as a single performance obligation satisfied over time. In certain circumstances, we supply proppant that is utilized for pressure pumping as part of the agreement with the customer. These pressure pumping agreements are accounted for as multiple performance obligations satisfied over time. Jobs for pressure pumping services are typically short-term in nature and range from a few hours to multiple days. Generally, revenue is recognized over time upon the completion of each segment of work based upon a completed field ticket, which includes the charges for the services performed, mobilization of the equipment to the location and personnel.\nPursuant to a contract with one of its customers, we have agreed to provide that customer with use of up to two pressure pumping fleets for the period covered by the contract. Under this agreement, performance obligations are satisfied as services are rendered based on the passage of time rather than the completion of each segment of work. We have the right to receive consideration from this customer even if circumstances prevent us from performing work. All consideration owed to us for services performed during the contractual period is fixed and the right to receive it is unconditional.\nAdditional revenue is generated through labor charges and the sale of consumable supplies that are incidental to the service being performed. Such amounts are recognized ratably over the period during which the corresponding goods and services are consumed.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services. We sell natural sand proppant through sand supply agreements with our customers. Under these agreements, sand is typically sold at a flat rate per ton or a flat rate per ton with an index-based adjustment. We recognize revenue at the point in time when the customer obtains legal title to the product, which may occur at the production facility, rail origin or at the destination terminal.\nCertain of our sand supply agreements contain a minimum volume commitment related to sand purchases whereby we charge a shortfall payment if the customer fails to meet the required minimum volume commitment. These agreements may also contain make-up provisions whereby shortfall payments can be applied in future periods against purchased volumes exceeding the minimum volume commitment. If a make-up right exists, we have future performance obligations to deliver excess volumes of product in subsequent periods. In accordance with ASC 606, if the customer fails to meet the minimum volume commitment, we assess whether we expect the customer to fulfill its unmet commitment during the contractually specified make-up period based on discussions with the customer and management's knowledge of the business. If we expect the customer will make-up deficient volumes in future periods, revenue related to shortfall payments is deferred and recognized on the earlier of the date on which the customer utilizes make-up volumes or the likelihood that the customer will exercise its right to make-up deficient volumes becomes remote. If we do not expect the customer will make-up deficient volumes in future periods, we apply the breakage model and revenue related to shortfall payments is recognized when the model indicates the customer's inability to take delivery of excess volumes.\nIn certain of our sand supply agreements, the customer obtains control of the product when it is loaded into rail cars and the customer reimburses us for all freight charges incurred. We have elected to account for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the sand. If revenue is recognized for the related product before the shipping and handling activities occur, we accrue the related costs of those shipping and handling activities.\nDrilling Services. Contract drilling services were provided under daywork contracts. Directional drilling services, including motor rentals, are provided on a day rate or hourly basis, and revenue is recognized as work progresses. Performance obligations are satisfied over time as the work progresses based on the measure of output. Mobilization revenue and costs were recognized over the days of actual drilling. As a result of market conditions, the Company temporarily shutdown its contract land drilling operations in December 2019.\nOther Services. During the periods presented in this report, we also provided coil tubing, pressure control, flowback, cementing, acidizing, equipment rentals, crude oil hauling, full service transportation and remote accommodations services, which are reported under other services. As a result of market conditions, the Company has temporarily shut down its cementing and acidizing operations as well as its flowback operations beginning in July 2019. Other services are typically provided based upon a purchase order, contract or on a spot market basis. Services are provided on a day rate, contracted or hourly basis. Performance obligations for these services are satisfied over time and revenue is recognized as the work progresses based on the measure of output. Jobs for these services are typically short-term in nature and range from a few hours to multiple days.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We regularly review receivables and provide for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts. In evaluating the level of established reserves, we make judgments regarding our customers' ability to make required payments, economic events and other factors. As the financial condition of customers change, circumstances develop or additional information becomes available, adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required. In the event we were to determine that a customer may not be able to make required payments, we would increase the allowance through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made. Uncollectable accounts receivable are periodically charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once final determination is made of their uncollectibility.\nDepreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion. In order to depreciate and amortize our property and equipment, we estimate useful lives, attrition factors and salvage values of these items. Our estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions, technological advances in the industries in which we operate or changes in regulations governing such industries. Depletion of our mining property and development costs is calculated using the units-of-production method on estimated measured tons of in-place reserves.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of such assets is evaluated by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the assets. If such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flow from the assets is not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets, the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair values.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. If it is determined that an impairment exists, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of carrying value over implied fair value. The fair value is determined using a combination of the income and market approaches.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. Mine reclamation costs, future remediation costs for inactive mines or other contractual site remediation costs are accrued based on management's best estimate at the end of each period of the costs expected to be incurred at a site. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised.\nEquity-based Compensation. We measure equity-based payments at fair value on the date of grant and expense the value of these equity-based payments in compensation expense over the applicable vesting periods.\nShare-based Compensation. The share-based compensation program consists of restricted stock units granted to employees and restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors under the Mammoth Energy Services, Inc. 2016 Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan\u201d). We recognize in our financial statements the cost of employee services received in exchange for restricted stock based on the fair value of the equity instruments as of the grant date. In general, this value is amortized over the vesting period; for grants with a non-substantive service condition, this value is recognized immediately. Amounts are recognized in cost of revenues and selling, general, and administrative expenses.\nIncome Taxes. Our operations are included in a consolidated federal income tax return and other state returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rate is recognized in the period that includes the statutory enactment date. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recognized when it is more likely than not that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842)\u201d amending the current accounting for leases. Under the new provisions, all lessees will report a right of use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than one year, while maintaining substantially similar classifications for financing and operating leases. Lessor accounting remains substantially unchanged with the exception that no leases entered into after the effective date will be classified as leveraged leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2019 utilizing the transition method permitted by ASU No. 2018-11 Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements\u201d, issued in August 2018, which permits an entity to recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption with no adjustment made to the comparative periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. See Note 15. Leases to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for the impact the adoption of this standard had on our financial statements.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Non-employee Share-Based Accounting,\u201d which simplifies the accounting for share-based payments granted to non-employees by aligning the accounting with requirements for employee share-based compensation. Upon transition, this ASU requires non-employee awards to be measured at fair value as of the adoption date. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2019 and estimated the fair value of our non-employee awards was approximately $18.9 million as of this date.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which amends current guidance on reporting credit losses on financial instruments. This ASU requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets, including trade accounts receivable. We will adopt this standard effective January 1, 2020.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations, estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are an integrated, growth-oriented company serving both the electric utility and oil and gas industries in North America. Our primary business objective is to grow our operations and create value for stockholders through organic growth opportunities and accretive acquisitions. Our suite of services includes infrastructure services, pressure pumping services, natural sand proppant services, drilling services and other services, which includes coil tubing, equipment rental, full service transportation, crude oil hauling, remote accommodations, oilfield equipment manufacturing and infrastructure engineering and design services. Our infrastructure services division provides construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services to the electrical infrastructure industry. Our pressure pumping services division provides hydraulic fracturing, sand hauling and water transfer services. Our natural sand proppant services division mines, processes and sells natural sand proppant used for hydraulic fracturing. Our drilling services division currently provides rental equipment, such as mud motors and operational tools, for both vertical and horizontal drilling as well as rig moving services. In addition to these service divisions, we also provide coil tubing services, pressure control services, equipment rentals, full service transportation, crude oil hauling services, remote accommodations, oilfield equipment manufacturing and infrastructure engineering and design services. We believe that the services we offer play a critical role in maintaining and improving electrical infrastructure as well as in increasing the ultimate recovery and present value of production streams from unconventional resources. Our complementary suite of services provides us with the opportunity to cross-sell our services and expand our customer base and geographic positioning.\nOur transformation towards an industrial based company is ongoing. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we began infrastructure engineering operations focused on the transmission and distribution industry and also commenced oilfield equipment manufacturing operations. The startup of oilfield equipment manufacturing operations provides us with the ability to repair much of our existing equipment in-house, as well as the option to manufacture certain new equipment we may need in the future. The oilfield equipment manufacturing operations will initially serve our internal needs for our water transfer and equipment rental businesses, but we expect to expand into third party sales in the future. We are continuing to explore other opportunities to expand our business lines as we shift to a broader industrial focus.\nOn November 24, 2014, Mammoth Energy Holdings LLC, or Mammoth Holdings, Gulfport Energy Corporation, or Gulfport, and Rhino Exploration LLC, or Rhino, contributed to the Company their respective interests in the following entities: Bison Drilling and Field Services, LLC, or Bison Drilling; Bison Trucking LLC, or Bison Trucking; White Wing Tubular Services LLC, or White Wing; Barracuda Logistics LLC, or Barracuda; Panther Drilling Systems LLC, or Panther Drilling; Redback Energy Services LLC, or Redback Energy Services; Redback Coil Tubing LLC, or Redback Coil Tubing; Muskie Proppant LLC, or Muskie Proppant; Stingray Pressure Pumping LLC, or Pressure Pumping; Stingray Logistics LLC, or Logistics; and Great White Sand Tiger Lodging Ltd., or Sand Tiger. Upon completion of these contributions, Mammoth Holdings, Gulfport and Rhino beneficially owned a 68.7%, 30.5% and 0.8% equity interest, respectively, in the Partnership. Subsequently, the Partnership formed Redback Pumpdown Services LLC, or Pumpdown, Mr. Inspections LLC, or Mr. Inspections, Silverback Energy Services LLC, or Silverback, and Mammoth Inc. as wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nOn October 12, 2016, prior to and in connection with the IPO, the Partnership converted to a Delaware limited liability company named Mammoth Energy Partners LLC, or Mammoth LLC, and Mammoth Holdings, Gulfport and Rhino contributed their respective membership interests in Mammoth LLC to us in exchange for shares of our common stock, and Mammoth LLC became our wholly-owned subsidiary.\nOn October 19, 2016, Mammoth Inc. closed its IPO of 7,750,000 shares of common stock, of which 7,500,000 shares were sold by Mammoth Inc. and the remaining 250,000 shares were sold by certain selling stockholders, at a price to the public of $15.00 per share. Mammoth Inc.'s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol TUSK.\u201d Mammoth Inc. was formed in June 2016, and did not conduct any material business operations prior to the completion of the IPO and the contribution described below completed on October 12, 2016 immediately prior to the IPO. Prior to the IPO, Mammoth Inc. was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership.\nOn June 5, 2017, we acquired Sturgeon Acquisitions LLC, or Sturgeon, and Sturgeon's wholly owned subsidiaries Taylor Frac, LLC, or Taylor Frac, Taylor Real Estate Investments, LLC, or Taylor Real Estate, and South River Road, LLC, or South River Road. Prior to the acquisition, we and Sturgeon were under common control and, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, we have accounted for this acquisition in a manner similar to the pooling of interest method of accounting. Therefore, our historical financial information for all periods included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been recast to combine Sturgeon's financial results with our financial results as if the acquisition had been effective since Sturgeon commenced operations.\nOur revenues, operating (loss) income and identifiable assets are primarily attributable to four reportable segments: infrastructure services; pressure pumping services; natural sand proppant services; and drilling services. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we identified three reportable segments consisting of infrastructure services, pressure pumping services and natural sand proppant services. Based on our assessment of FASB ASC 280, Segment Reporting, guidance at December 31, 2019, we changed our reportable segment presentation in 2019 to include drilling services, which includes Bison Drilling, Bison Trucking, Panther Drilling, Mako Acquisitions and White Wing Tubular, as its own reportable segment. Segment evaluation is determined on a quantitative basis based on a function of operating income (loss), as well as a qualitative basis, such as nature of the product and service offerings and types of customers. The results of operations for 2018 and 2017 below have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this change in reportable segments.\nSince the dates presented below, we have conducted our operations through the following entities:\nPressure Pumping Services Segment\n \u2022 Pressure Pumping-March 2012 \n \u2022 Silverback Energy, formerly Logistics-November 2012 \n \u2022 Barracuda-October 2014 \n \u2022 Pumpdown-January 2015 \n \u2022 Mr. Inspections-January 2015 \n \u2022 Mammoth Equipment Leasing LLC-November 2016 \n \u2022 Bison Sand Logistics LLC-January 2018 \n \u2022 Aquahawk Energy LLC, or Aquahawk-June 2018 \nInfrastructure Services Segment\n \u2022 Cobra Acquisitions LLC, or Cobra-January 2017 \n \u2022 Lion Power Services, formerly Cobra Energy LLC-January 2017 \n \u2022 Higher Power Electrical LLC, or Higher Power-April 2017 \n \u2022 5 Star Electric LLC, or 5 Star-July 2017 \n \u2022 Dire Wolf Energy Services LLC-January 2018 \n \u2022 Cobra Aviation LLC, or Cobra Aviation-January 2018 \n \u2022 Cobra Logistics LLC-February 2018 \n \u2022 Cobra Caribbean LLC-October 2018 \n \u2022 Air Rescue Systems LLC, or ARS-December 2018 \n \u2022 Python Equipment LLC-December 2018 \n \u2022 Predator Aviation LLC-April 2019 \n \u2022 Leopard Aviation-April 2019 \nNatural Sand Proppant Services Segment\n \u2022 Muskie Proppant-September 2011 \n \u2022 Piranha Proppant LLC, or Piranha-May 2017 \n \u2022 Sturgeon Acquisitions-June 2017 \n \u2022 Taylor Frac-June 2017 \n \u2022 Taylor Real Estate-June 2017 \n \u2022 South River Road-June 2017 \nDrilling Services Segment\n \u2022 Bison Drilling-November 2010 \n \u2022 Panther Drilling-December 2012 \n \u2022 Bison Trucking-August 2013 \n \u2022 White Wing-September 2014 \n \u2022 Mako Acquisitions LLC-March 2017 \nOther\n \u2022 Sand Tiger-October 2007 \n \u2022 Redback Energy Services-October 2011 \n \u2022 Redback Coil Tubing-May 2012 \n \u2022 WTL Oil LLC, or WTL, formerly Silverback-June 2016 \n \u2022 Mammoth Energy Partners, LLC-June 2016 \n \u2022 Stingray Energy Services LLC, or Stingray Energy Services-June 2017 \n \u2022 Stingray Cementing LLC-June 2017 \n \u2022 Tiger Shark Logistics LLC-October 2017 \n \u2022 Black Mamba Energy LLC-March 2018 \n \u2022 Stingray Cementing and Acidizing, formerly RTS Energy Services LLC-June 2018 \n \u2022 Ivory Freight Solutions LLC-July 2018 \n \u2022 IFX Transport LLC-December 2018 \n \u2022 Anaconda Manufacturing LLC-September 2019 \n \u2022 Aquawolf LLC-September 2019 \nRevolving Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2019, our revolving credit facility contained two financial covenants: a minimum interest coverage ratio (3.0 to 1.0) and a maximum leverage ratio (4.0 to 1.0). As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the financial covenants under our revolving credit facility. However, we believe that our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing four fiscal quarters would have resulted in a breach of the maximum leverage ratio and/or the interest coverage ratio as early as the end of the first quarter of 2020 if we did not receive payments due from PREPA before the end of such quarter. As we believe that such payments from PREPA are unlikely to be received by March 31, 2020, on February 26, 2020, we amended our revolving credit facility to, among other things, (i) amend our financial covenants, (ii) decrease the maximum revolving advance amount from $185 million to $130 million, (iii) decrease the amount that the maximum revolving advance can be increased to (the accordion) from $350 million to $180 million, (iv) increase the applicable margin ranges from 2.00% to 2.50% per annum in the case of the alternate base rate and from 3.00% to 3.50% per annum in the case of LIBOR, (v) increase the aggregate amount of permitted asset dispositions, and (vi) permit certain sale-leaseback transactions. For additional information regarding the amendments to our revolving credit facility, see -Our Revolving Credit Facility\u201d below.\n2019 Highlights\n \u2022 Net loss of $79 million, or $1.76 per diluted share, and adjusted net loss of $38 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2019. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted net loss. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA of $77 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA. \n \u2022 Paid cash dividends of $0.25 per share. Beginning with the second quarter of 2019, we suspended the quarterly cash dividend in response to oilfield market conditions and other factors, which include collections from PREPA. \n \u2022 Formed an infrastructure engineering company focused on the transmission and distribution industry and commenced oilfield equipment manufacturing operations. \n \u2022 Hired a new president for our infrastructure division and recently added experienced industry personnel to key management positions. \nOverview of Our Industries\nEnergy Infrastructure Industry\nOur infrastructure services business provides construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services to the electrical infrastructure industry. We offer a broad range of services on electric transmission and distribution, or T&D, networks and substation facilities, which include construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair of high voltage transmission lines, substations and lower voltage overhead and underground distribution systems. Our commercial services include the installation, maintenance and repair of commercial wiring. We also provide storm repair and restoration services in response to storms and\nother disasters. We provide infrastructure services primarily in the northeast, southwest and midwest portions of the United States.\nWe currently have agreements in place with private utilities, public IOUs and Co-Ops. Since we commenced operations in this line of business, substantially all of our infrastructure revenues has been generated from storm restoration work, primarily from PREPA, due to damage caused by Hurricane Maria. On October 19, 2017, Cobra Acquisitions LLC, or Cobra, and PREPA entered into an emergency master services agreement for repairs to PREPA's electrical grid. The one-year contract, as amended, provided for payments of up to $945 million. On May 26, 2018, Cobra and PREPA entered into a second one-year, $900 million master services agreement to provide additional repair services and begin the initial phase of reconstruction of the electrical power system in Puerto Rico. Our work under each of the contracts with PREPA ended on March 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019, PREPA owed us approximately $227 million for services we performed, excluding $42 million of interest charged on these delinquent balances as of December 31, 2019. See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Accounts Receivable to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. PREPA is currently subject to bankruptcy proceedings, which were filed in July 2017 and are currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. As a result, PREPA's ability to meet its payment obligations under the contracts is largely dependent upon funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency or other sources. On September 30, 2019, we filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico seeking recovery of the amounts owed to us by PREPA. PREPA filed a motion to stay our motion on the ground that the ongoing criminal proceedings described below against the former president of Cobra and two other individuals may affect our recovery of those amounts. On October 17, 2019, the court granted PREPA's request to stay our motion and, on February 3, 2020, extended the stay until a status conference to be held on June 17, 2020. In the event PREPA (i) does not have or does not obtain the funds necessary to satisfy its obligations to Cobra under the contracts, (ii) obtains the necessary funds but refuses to pay the amounts owed to us or (iii) otherwise does not pay amounts owed to us for services performed, the receivable may not be collected and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, government contracts are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits and compliance reviews by government agencies and representatives. In this regard, on September 10, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico unsealed an indictment that charged the former president of Cobra with conspiracy, wire fraud, false statements and disaster fraud. Two other individuals were also charged in the indictment. The indictment is focused on the interactions between a former FEMA official and the former President of Cobra. Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries were charged in the indictment. We are continuing to cooperate with the related investigation. We are also subject to investigations and legal proceedings related to our contracts with PREPA. Given the uncertainty inherent in the criminal litigation, investigations and legal proceedings, it is not possible at this time to determine the potential outcome or other potential impacts that they could have on us. See Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information regarding these investigations and proceedings. Further, as noted above, our contracts with PREPA have concluded and we have not obtained, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain, one or more contracts with PREPA or other customers to replace the level of services that we provided to PREPA under our previous contracts.\nSince the completion of our work in Puerto Rico on March 31, 2019, we focused on right-sizing our infrastructure operations and performing required maintenance on our equipment, which had been subjected to harsh working conditions. This process, with its associated costs, was completed during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nDemand for our infrastructure services in the continental United States has increased since we began operations in 2017. We had a total of approximately 140 transmission and distribution crews as of December 31, 2019, as compared to approximately 105 at December 31, 2018 and approximately 50 at December 31, 2017. Transmission crew size varies based upon the scope of the project and factors such as voltage, structure type, number of conductors and type of foundation. Each distribution crew generally consists of five employees. These transmission and distribution crews are working for multiple utilities primarily across the northeastern, midwestern and southwestern portions of the United States. We recently hired a new president for our infrastructure division and have added experienced industry personnel to key management positions. With this team in place, we believe we will be able to grow our customer base and increase our revenues in the continental United States over the coming years. We also believe that the skill sets and experience of our crews will afford us enhanced bidding opportunities in both the U.S. and overseas.\nOil and Natural Gas Industry\nThe oil and natural gas industry has traditionally been volatile and is influenced by a combination of long-term, short-term and cyclical trends, including the domestic and international supply and demand for oil and natural gas, current and expected future prices for oil and natural gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices, production depletion\nrates and the resultant levels of cash flows generated and allocated by exploration and production companies to their drilling, completion and related services and products budget. The oil and natural gas industry is also impacted by general domestic and international economic conditions, political instability in oil producing countries, government regulations (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of customer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity and other conditions and factors that are beyond our control.\nDemand for most of our oil and natural gas products and services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. The levels of capital expenditures of our customers are predominantly driven by the prices of oil and natural gas. Over the past several years, commodity prices, particularly oil, has seen significant volatility with pricing ranging from a high of $110.53 per barrel on September 6, 2013 to a low of $26.19 per barrel on February 11, 2016. During 2019, oil prices fluctuated between a low of $45.41 on January 1, 2019 and a high of $66.30 on April 23, 2019, and averaged $57.03 per barrel for the year. Certain factors related to world politics and major oil producers caused fluctuations in the oil price during 2019. However, overall, the price of oil stayed relatively stable throughout the year.\nWe anticipate demand for our oil and natural gas services and products will continue to be dependent on the level of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry and, ultimately, commodity prices. We experienced a weakening in demand for our oilfield services beginning in the third quarter of 2019, which continued throughout the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of budget exhaustion and capital discipline from our customers. In addition, other factors, including access to capital and the need to refinance or repay maturing debt, have had a significant influence on some of our customers' capital budgets and activity levels. While we still expect commodity prices to be the primary driver of capex spending and industry activity levels in the future, other factors may play a significant role in the ultimate level of capex spending by the companies that use our completion and production, natural sand proppant and directional drilling businesses.\nDuring 2019, we experienced lower utilization rates and pricing for our oil and natural gas services, including our pressure pumping, contract drilling, coil tubing and directional drilling equipment and services, as compared to 2018. Further, in response to market conditions, in July 2019 we temporarily shut down our cementing and acidizing operations and flowback operations. Additionally, in December 2019 we temporarily shut down our contract drilling operations. We continue to monitor the market to determine if and when we can recommence these services. Based on current feedback from our exploration and production customers, we expect them to take a cautious approach to activity levels in 2020 given the recent volatility in oil prices and investor sentiment calling for activities to remain within or below cash flows. Market fundamentals are challenging for our oil field businesses. Although we believe the reported retirement of equipment across the industry is beginning to help the market, pricing and utilization for our oil field businesses are, and are expected to remain depressed for the foreseeable future. We intend to closely monitor our cost structure in response to market conditions and pursue cost savings where possible. Further, a significant portion of our revenue from our pressure pumping business is derived from Gulfport pursuant to a contract that expires in December 2021. On December 28, 2019, Gulfport filed a lawsuit alleging our breach of this contract and seeking to terminate the contract and recover damages for alleged overpayments, audit costs and legal fees. We believe this action is without merit and will vigorously defend the lawsuit. However, the termination of our relationship with Gulfport, or nonrenewal of our contract with Gulfport, or one or more of our other customers, if not replaced with comparable or greater levels of service from other customers, would result in lower utilization rates for our pressure pumping equipment and, as a result, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nNatural Sand Proppant Industry\nIn the natural sand proppant industry, demand growth for frac sand and other proppants is primarily driven by advancements in oil and natural gas drilling and well completion technology and techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, as well as overall industry activity growth.\nIn 2018 and 2019, several new and existing suppliers completed planned capacity additions of frac sand supply, particularly in the Permian Basin. The industry expansion, coupled with increased capital discipline and budget exhaustion, caused the frac sand market to become oversupplied, particularly in finer grades, during the second half of 2019. With the frac sand market oversupplied, pricing for certain grades has fallen significantly from the peaks experienced throughout 2018 and during the first half of 2019. This oversupply resulted in several industry participants idling and closing high cost mines in an attempt to restore the supply and demand balance and reduce the number of industry participants. Nevertheless, demand for our sand declined significantly in the second half of 2019 as a result of increased capital discipline by our customers and budget exhaustion, among other factors. We cannot predict if and when demand and pricing will recover sufficiently to return our natural sand proppant services segment to profitability.\nDuring the first half of 2018, constraints in the rail system adversely impacted frac sand deliveries from our Taylor sand facility in Jackson County, Wisconsin. As a result, we estimate production at our Taylor facility was 23% lower during the\nfirst half of 2018 than it would have been in the absence of these constraints. These rail system constraints were largely alleviated during the third quarter of 2018 and we do not believe they had an impact on our operations in 2019. Production at our Piranha facility was not impacted by these rail constraints.\nFurther, as a result of adverse market conditions, production at our Muskie sand facility in Pierce County, Wisconsin has been temporarily idled since September 2018. Our Taylor sand facility in Taylor, Wisconsin and Piranha sand facility in New Auburn, Wisconsin are currently running at 20% to 25% capacity. Our contracted capacity has provided a strong baseline of business, which has kept our Taylor and Piranha plants operating and our costs low. Our blended production costs have declined 24% from $15.54 during 2018 to $11.82 during 2019.\nOur subsidiary Muskie Proppant is a party to a contract with Gulfport under which we sell and deliver specified amounts of sand to Gulfport. The agreement, as amended, has a term ending in December 2021. This agreement is not subject to the current disputes with Gulfport regarding the our pressure pumping contract.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\n\nRevenue. Revenue for 2019 decreased $1.1 billion, or 63%, to $625 million from $1.7 billion for 2018. The decline in total revenue is primarily attributable to a $868 million decrease in infrastructure services revenue, representing 81% of the overall decrease. Additionally, pressure pumping services and natural sand proppant services revenue decreased $123 million and $68 million, respectively, representing 12% and 6% of the overall decrease. Revenue derived from related parties was $130 million, or 21% of our total revenue, for 2019 and $143 million, or 8% of our total revenue, for 2018. Substantially all of our related party revenue is derived from Gulfport under pressure pumping and sand contracts. Revenue by division was as follows:\nInfrastructure Services. Infrastructure services division revenue decreased $868 million, or 80%, to $214 million for 2019 from $1.1 billion for 2018 primarily due to the conclusion on March 31, 2019 of the work we performed under our contracts with PREPA for repairs to Puerto Rico's electrical grid as a result of Hurricane Maria. For additional information regarding our contracts with PREPA and our infrastructure services, see Overview of Our Industries - Electrical Infrastructure Industry\u201d above. Revenue from our operations in the continental United States increased $58 million, or 96%, to $118 million for 2019 from $60 million for 2018.\nPressure Pumping Services. Pressure pumping services division revenue decreased $123 million, or 33%, to $246 million for 2019 from $369 million for 2018. Revenue derived from related parties was $91 million, or 37% of total pressure pumping revenue, for 2019 and $96 million, or 26% of total pressure pumping revenue, for 2018. Substantially all of our related party revenue is derived from Gulfport under a pressure pumping contract. For additional information regarding the status of this contract, see Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. Intersegment revenue, consisting primarily of revenue derived from our sand segment, totaled $4 million and $7 million, respectively, for 2019 and 2018.\nThe decrease in our pressure pumping services revenue was primarily driven by a decline in pricing as well as a decline in utilization. The number of stages completed decreased 14% to 5,378 for 2019 from 6,245 for 2018. An average of 2.4 of our fleets were active throughout 2019 compared to 3.6 fleets for 2018.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services. Natural sand proppant services division revenue decreased $68 million, or 40%, to $100 million for 2019, from $168 million for 2018. Revenue derived from related parties was $28 million, or 28% of total sand revenue, for 2019 and $25 million, or 15% of total sand revenue, for 2018. All of our related party revenue is derived from Gulfport under a contract effective through December 31, 2021. Intersegment revenue, consisting primarily of revenue derived from our pressure pumping segment, totaled $30 million, or 30% of total sand revenue, for 2019", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations, estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are an integrated, growth-oriented company serving both the electric utility and oil and gas industries in North America. Our primary business objective is to grow our operations and create value for stockholders through organic growth opportunities and accretive acquisitions. Our suite of services includes infrastructure services, pressure pumping services, natural sand proppant services, drilling services and other services, which includes coil tubing, equipment rental, full service transportation, crude oil hauling, remote accommodations, oilfield equipment manufacturing and infrastructure engineering and design services. Our infrastructure services division provides construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services to the electrical infrastructure industry. Our pressure pumping services division provides hydraulic fracturing, sand hauling and water transfer services. Our natural sand proppant services division mines, processes and sells natural sand proppant used for hydraulic fracturing. Our drilling services division currently provides rental equipment, such as mud motors and operational tools, for both vertical and horizontal drilling as well as rig moving services. In addition to these service divisions, we also provide coil tubing services, pressure control services, equipment rentals, full service transportation, crude oil hauling services, remote accommodations, oilfield equipment manufacturing and infrastructure engineering and design services. We believe that the services we offer play a critical role in maintaining and improving electrical infrastructure as well as in increasing the ultimate recovery and present value of production streams from unconventional resources. Our complementary suite of services provides us with the opportunity to cross-sell our services and expand our customer base and geographic positioning.\nOur transformation towards an industrial based company is ongoing. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we began infrastructure engineering operations focused on the transmission and distribution industry and also commenced oilfield equipment manufacturing operations. The startup of oilfield equipment manufacturing operations provides us with the ability to repair much of our existing equipment in-house, as well as the option to manufacture certain new equipment we may need in the future. The oilfield equipment manufacturing operations will initially serve our internal needs for our water transfer and equipment rental businesses, but we expect to expand into third party sales in the future. We are continuing to explore other opportunities to expand our business lines as we shift to a broader industrial focus.\nOn November 24, 2014, Mammoth Energy Holdings LLC, or Mammoth Holdings, Gulfport Energy Corporation, or Gulfport, and Rhino Exploration LLC, or Rhino, contributed to the Company their respective interests in the following entities: Bison Drilling and Field Services, LLC, or Bison Drilling; Bison Trucking LLC, or Bison Trucking; White Wing Tubular Services LLC, or White Wing; Barracuda Logistics LLC, or Barracuda; Panther Drilling Systems LLC, or Panther Drilling; Redback Energy Services LLC, or Redback Energy Services; Redback Coil Tubing LLC, or Redback Coil Tubing; Muskie Proppant LLC, or Muskie Proppant; Stingray Pressure Pumping LLC, or Pressure Pumping; Stingray Logistics LLC, or Logistics; and Great White Sand Tiger Lodging Ltd., or Sand Tiger. Upon completion of these contributions, Mammoth Holdings, Gulfport and Rhino beneficially owned a 68.7%, 30.5% and 0.8% equity interest, respectively, in the Partnership. Subsequently, the Partnership formed Redback Pumpdown Services LLC, or Pumpdown, Mr. Inspections LLC, or Mr. Inspections, Silverback Energy Services LLC, or Silverback, and Mammoth Inc. as wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nOn October 12, 2016, prior to and in connection with the IPO, the Partnership converted to a Delaware limited liability company named Mammoth Energy Partners LLC, or Mammoth LLC, and Mammoth Holdings, Gulfport and Rhino contributed their respective membership interests in Mammoth LLC to us in exchange for shares of our common stock, and Mammoth LLC became our wholly-owned subsidiary.\nOn October 19, 2016, Mammoth Inc. closed its IPO of 7,750,000 shares of common stock, of which 7,500,000 shares were sold by Mammoth Inc. and the remaining 250,000 shares were sold by certain selling stockholders, at a price to the public of $15.00 per share. Mammoth Inc.'s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol TUSK.\u201d Mammoth Inc. was formed in June 2016, and did not conduct any material business operations prior to the completion of the IPO and the contribution described below completed on October 12, 2016 immediately prior to the IPO. Prior to the IPO, Mammoth Inc. was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership.\nOn June 5, 2017, we acquired Sturgeon Acquisitions LLC, or Sturgeon, and Sturgeon's wholly owned subsidiaries Taylor Frac, LLC, or Taylor Frac, Taylor Real Estate Investments, LLC, or Taylor Real Estate, and South River Road, LLC, or South River Road. Prior to the acquisition, we and Sturgeon were under common control and, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, we have accounted for this acquisition in a manner similar to the pooling of interest method of accounting. Therefore, our historical financial information for all periods included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been recast to combine Sturgeon's financial results with our financial results as if the acquisition had been effective since Sturgeon commenced operations.\nOur revenues, operating (loss) income and identifiable assets are primarily attributable to four reportable segments: infrastructure services; pressure pumping services; natural sand proppant services; and drilling services. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we identified three reportable segments consisting of infrastructure services, pressure pumping services and natural sand proppant services. Based on our assessment of FASB ASC 280, Segment Reporting, guidance at December 31, 2019, we changed our reportable segment presentation in 2019 to include drilling services, which includes Bison Drilling, Bison Trucking, Panther Drilling, Mako Acquisitions and White Wing Tubular, as its own reportable segment. Segment evaluation is determined on a quantitative basis based on a function of operating income (loss), as well as a qualitative basis, such as nature of the product and service offerings and types of customers. The results of operations for 2018 and 2017 below have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this change in reportable segments.\nSince the dates presented below, we have conducted our operations through the following entities:\nPressure Pumping Services Segment\n \u2022 Pressure Pumping-March 2012 \n \u2022 Silverback Energy, formerly Logistics-November 2012 \n \u2022 Barracuda-October 2014 \n \u2022 Pumpdown-January 2015 \n \u2022 Mr. Inspections-January 2015 \n \u2022 Mammoth Equipment Leasing LLC-November 2016 \n \u2022 Bison Sand Logistics LLC-January 2018 \n \u2022 Aquahawk Energy LLC, or Aquahawk-June 2018 \nInfrastructure Services Segment\n \u2022 Cobra Acquisitions LLC, or Cobra-January 2017 \n \u2022 Lion Power Services, formerly Cobra Energy LLC-January 2017 \n \u2022 Higher Power Electrical LLC, or Higher Power-April 2017 \n \u2022 5 Star Electric LLC, or 5 Star-July 2017 \n \u2022 Dire Wolf Energy Services LLC-January 2018 \n \u2022 Cobra Aviation LLC, or Cobra Aviation-January 2018 \n \u2022 Cobra Logistics LLC-February 2018 \n \u2022 Cobra Caribbean LLC-October 2018 \n \u2022 Air Rescue Systems LLC, or ARS-December 2018 \n \u2022 Python Equipment LLC-December 2018 \n \u2022 Predator Aviation LLC-April 2019 \n \u2022 Leopard Aviation-April 2019 \nNatural Sand Proppant Services Segment\n \u2022 Muskie Proppant-September 2011 \n \u2022 Piranha Proppant LLC, or Piranha-May 2017 \n \u2022 Sturgeon Acquisitions-June 2017 \n \u2022 Taylor Frac-June 2017 \n \u2022 Taylor Real Estate-June 2017 \n \u2022 South River Road-June 2017 \nDrilling Services Segment\n \u2022 Bison Drilling-November 2010 \n \u2022 Panther Drilling-December 2012 \n \u2022 Bison Trucking-August 2013 \n \u2022 White Wing-September 2014 \n \u2022 Mako Acquisitions LLC-March 2017 \nOther\n \u2022 Sand Tiger-October 2007 \n \u2022 Redback Energy Services-October 2011 \n \u2022 Redback Coil Tubing-May 2012 \n \u2022 WTL Oil LLC, or WTL, formerly Silverback-June 2016 \n \u2022 Mammoth Energy Partners, LLC-June 2016 \n \u2022 Stingray Energy Services LLC, or Stingray Energy Services-June 2017 \n \u2022 Stingray Cementing LLC-June 2017 \n \u2022 Tiger Shark Logistics LLC-October 2017 \n \u2022 Black Mamba Energy LLC-March 2018 \n \u2022 Stingray Cementing and Acidizing, formerly RTS Energy Services LLC-June 2018 \n \u2022 Ivory Freight Solutions LLC-July 2018 \n \u2022 IFX Transport LLC-December 2018 \n \u2022 Anaconda Manufacturing LLC-September 2019 \n \u2022 Aquawolf LLC-September 2019 \nRevolving Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2019, our revolving credit facility contained two financial covenants: a minimum interest coverage ratio (3.0 to 1.0) and a maximum leverage ratio (4.0 to 1.0). As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the financial covenants under our revolving credit facility. However, we believe that our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing four fiscal quarters would have resulted in a breach of the maximum leverage ratio and/or the interest coverage ratio as early as the end of the first quarter of 2020 if we did not receive payments due from PREPA before the end of such quarter. As we believe that such payments from PREPA are unlikely to be received by March 31, 2020, on February 26, 2020, we amended our revolving credit facility to, among other things, (i) amend our financial covenants, (ii) decrease the maximum revolving advance amount from $185 million to $130 million, (iii) decrease the amount that the maximum revolving advance can be increased to (the accordion) from $350 million to $180 million, (iv) increase the applicable margin ranges from 2.00% to 2.50% per annum in the case of the alternate base rate and from 3.00% to 3.50% per annum in the case of LIBOR, (v) increase the aggregate amount of permitted asset dispositions, and (vi) permit certain sale-leaseback transactions. For additional information regarding the amendments to our revolving credit facility, see -Our Revolving Credit Facility\u201d below.\n2019 Highlights\n \u2022 Net loss of $79 million, or $1.76 per diluted share, and adjusted net loss of $38 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2019. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted net loss. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA of $77 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA. \n \u2022 Paid cash dividends of $0.25 per share. Beginning with the second quarter of 2019, we suspended the quarterly cash dividend in response to oilfield market conditions and other factors, which include collections from PREPA. \n \u2022 Formed an infrastructure engineering company focused on the transmission and distribution industry and commenced oilfield equipment manufacturing operations. \n \u2022 Hired a new president for our infrastructure division and recently added experienced industry personnel to key management positions. \nOverview of Our Industries\nEnergy Infrastructure Industry\nOur infrastructure services business provides construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services to the electrical infrastructure industry. We offer a broad range of services on electric transmission and distribution, or T&D, networks and substation facilities, which include construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair of high voltage transmission lines, substations and lower voltage overhead and underground distribution systems. Our commercial services include the installation, maintenance and repair of commercial wiring. We also provide storm repair and restoration services in response to storms and\nother disasters. We provide infrastructure services primarily in the northeast, southwest and midwest portions of the United States.\nWe currently have agreements in place with private utilities, public IOUs and Co-Ops. Since we commenced operations in this line of business, substantially all of our infrastructure revenues has been generated from storm restoration work, primarily from PREPA, due to damage caused by Hurricane Maria. On October 19, 2017, Cobra Acquisitions LLC, or Cobra, and PREPA entered into an emergency master services agreement for repairs to PREPA's electrical grid. The one-year contract, as amended, provided for payments of up to $945 million. On May 26, 2018, Cobra and PREPA entered into a second one-year, $900 million master services agreement to provide additional repair services and begin the initial phase of reconstruction of the electrical power system in Puerto Rico. Our work under each of the contracts with PREPA ended on March 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019, PREPA owed us approximately $227 million for services we performed, excluding $42 million of interest charged on these delinquent balances as of December 31, 2019. See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Accounts Receivable to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. PREPA is currently subject to bankruptcy proceedings, which were filed in July 2017 and are currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. As a result, PREPA's ability to meet its payment obligations under the contracts is largely dependent upon funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency or other sources. On September 30, 2019, we filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico seeking recovery of the amounts owed to us by PREPA. PREPA filed a motion to stay our motion on the ground that the ongoing criminal proceedings described below against the former president of Cobra and two other individuals may affect our recovery of those amounts. On October 17, 2019, the court granted PREPA's request to stay our motion and, on February 3, 2020, extended the stay until a status conference to be held on June 17, 2020. In the event PREPA (i) does not have or does not obtain the funds necessary to satisfy its obligations to Cobra under the contracts, (ii) obtains the necessary funds but refuses to pay the amounts owed to us or (iii) otherwise does not pay amounts owed to us for services performed, the receivable may not be collected and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, government contracts are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits and compliance reviews by government agencies and representatives. In this regard, on September 10, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico unsealed an indictment that charged the former president of Cobra with conspiracy, wire fraud, false statements and disaster fraud. Two other individuals were also charged in the indictment. The indictment is focused on the interactions between a former FEMA official and the former President of Cobra. Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries were charged in the indictment. We are continuing to cooperate with the related investigation. We are also subject to investigations and legal proceedings related to our contracts with PREPA. Given the uncertainty inherent in the criminal litigation, investigations and legal proceedings, it is not possible at this time to determine the potential outcome or other potential impacts that they could have on us. See Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information regarding these investigations and proceedings. Further, as noted above, our contracts with PREPA have concluded and we have not obtained, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain, one or more contracts with PREPA or other customers to replace the level of services that we provided to PREPA under our previous contracts.\nSince the completion of our work in Puerto Rico on March 31, 2019, we focused on right-sizing our infrastructure operations and performing required maintenance on our equipment, which had been subjected to harsh working conditions. This process, with its associated costs, was completed during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nDemand for our infrastructure services in the continental United States has increased since we began operations in 2017. We had a total of approximately 140 transmission and distribution crews as of December 31, 2019, as compared to approximately 105 at December 31, 2018 and approximately 50 at December 31, 2017. Transmission crew size varies based upon the scope of the project and factors such as voltage, structure type, number of conductors and type of foundation. Each distribution crew generally consists of five employees. These transmission and distribution crews are working for multiple utilities primarily across the northeastern, midwestern and southwestern portions of the United States. We recently hired a new president for our infrastructure division and have added experienced industry personnel to key management positions. With this team in place, we believe we will be able to grow our customer base and increase our revenues in the continental United States over the coming years. We also believe that the skill sets and experience of our crews will afford us enhanced bidding opportunities in both the U.S. and overseas.\nOil and Natural Gas Industry\nThe oil and natural gas industry has traditionally been volatile and is influenced by a combination of long-term, short-term and cyclical trends, including the domestic and international supply and demand for oil and natural gas, current and expected future prices for oil and natural gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices, production depletion\nrates and the resultant levels of cash flows generated and allocated by exploration and production companies to their drilling, completion and related services and products budget. The oil and natural gas industry is also impacted by general domestic and international economic conditions, political instability in oil producing countries, government regulations (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of customer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity and other conditions and factors that are beyond our control.\nDemand for most of our oil and natural gas products and services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. The levels of capital expenditures of our customers are predominantly driven by the prices of oil and natural gas. Over the past several years, commodity prices, particularly oil, has seen significant volatility with pricing ranging from a high of $110.53 per barrel on September 6, 2013 to a low of $26.19 per barrel on February 11, 2016. During 2019, oil prices fluctuated between a low of $45.41 on January 1, 2019 and a high of $66.30 on April 23, 2019, and averaged $57.03 per barrel for the year. Certain factors related to world politics and major oil producers caused fluctuations in the oil price during 2019. However, overall, the price of oil stayed relatively stable throughout the year.\nWe anticipate demand for our oil and natural gas services and products will continue to be dependent on the level of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry and, ultimately, commodity prices. We experienced a weakening in demand for our oilfield services beginning in the third quarter of 2019, which continued throughout the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of budget exhaustion and capital discipline from our customers. In addition, other factors, including access to capital and the need to refinance or repay maturing debt, have had a significant influence on some of our customers' capital budgets and activity levels. While we still expect commodity prices to be the primary driver of capex spending and industry activity levels in the future, other factors may play a significant role in the ultimate level of capex spending by the companies that use our completion and production, natural sand proppant and directional drilling businesses.\nDuring 2019, we experienced lower utilization rates and pricing for our oil and natural gas services, including our pressure pumping, contract drilling, coil tubing and directional drilling equipment and services, as compared to 2018. Further, in response to market conditions, in July 2019 we temporarily shut down our cementing and acidizing operations and flowback operations. Additionally, in December 2019 we temporarily shut down our contract drilling operations. We continue to monitor the market to determine if and when we can recommence these services. Based on current feedback from our exploration and production customers, we expect them to take a cautious approach to activity levels in 2020 given the recent volatility in oil prices and investor sentiment calling for activities to remain within or below cash flows. Market fundamentals are challenging for our oil field businesses. Although we believe the reported retirement of equipment across the industry is beginning to help the market, pricing and utilization for our oil field businesses are, and are expected to remain depressed for the foreseeable future. We intend to closely monitor our cost structure in response to market conditions and pursue cost savings where possible. Further, a significant portion of our revenue from our pressure pumping business is derived from Gulfport pursuant to a contract that expires in December 2021. On December 28, 2019, Gulfport filed a lawsuit alleging our breach of this contract and seeking to terminate the contract and recover damages for alleged overpayments, audit costs and legal fees. We believe this action is without merit and will vigorously defend the lawsuit. However, the termination of our relationship with Gulfport, or nonrenewal of our contract with Gulfport, or one or more of our other customers, if not replaced with comparable or greater levels of service from other customers, would result in lower utilization rates for our pressure pumping equipment and, as a result, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nNatural Sand Proppant Industry\nIn the natural sand proppant industry, demand growth for frac sand and other proppants is primarily driven by advancements in oil and natural gas drilling and well completion technology and techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, as well as overall industry activity growth.\nIn 2018 and 2019, several new and existing suppliers completed planned capacity additions of frac sand supply, particularly in the Permian Basin. The industry expansion, coupled with increased capital discipline and budget exhaustion, caused the frac sand market to become oversupplied, particularly in finer grades, during the second half of 2019. With the frac sand market oversupplied, pricing for certain grades has fallen significantly from the peaks experienced throughout 2018 and during the first half of 2019. This oversupply resulted in several industry participants idling and closing high cost mines in an attempt to restore the supply and demand balance and reduce the number of industry participants. Nevertheless, demand for our sand declined significantly in the second half of 2019 as a result of increased capital discipline by our customers and budget exhaustion, among other factors. We cannot predict if and when demand and pricing will recover sufficiently to return our natural sand proppant services segment to profitability.\nDuring the first half of 2018, constraints in the rail system adversely impacted frac sand deliveries from our Taylor sand facility in Jackson County, Wisconsin. As a result, we estimate production at our Taylor facility was 23% lower during the\nfirst half of 2018 than it would have been in the absence of these constraints. These rail system constraints were largely alleviated during the third quarter of 2018 and we do not believe they had an impact on our operations in 2019. Production at our Piranha facility was not impacted by these rail constraints.\nFurther, as a result of adverse market conditions, production at our Muskie sand facility in Pierce County, Wisconsin has been temporarily idled since September 2018. Our Taylor sand facility in Taylor, Wisconsin and Piranha sand facility in New Auburn, Wisconsin are currently running at 20% to 25% capacity. Our contracted capacity has provided a strong baseline of business, which has kept our Taylor and Piranha plants operating and our costs low. Our blended production costs have declined 24% from $15.54 during 2018 to $11.82 during 2019.\nOur subsidiary Muskie Proppant is a party to a contract with Gulfport under which we sell and deliver specified amounts of sand to Gulfport. The agreement, as amended, has a term ending in December 2021.

Revenue for 2019 decreased $1.1 billion, or 63%, to $625 million from $1.7 billion for 2018. The decline in total revenue is primarily attributable to a $868 million decrease in infrastructure services revenue, representing 81% of the overall decrease. Additionally, pressure pumping services and natural sand proppant services revenue decreased $123 million and $68 million, respectively, representing 12% and 6% of the overall decrease. Revenue derived from related parties was $130 million, or 21% of our total revenue, for 2019 and $143 million, or 8% of our total revenue, for 2018. Substantially all of our related party revenue is derived from Gulfport under pressure pumping and sand contracts. Revenue by division was as follows:\nInfrastructure Services. Infrastructure services division revenue decreased $868 million, or 80%, to $214 million for 2019 from $1.1 billion for 2018 primarily due to the conclusion on March 31, 2019 of the work we performed under our contracts with PREPA for repairs to Puerto Rico's electrical grid as a result of Hurricane Maria. For additional information regarding our contracts with PREPA and our infrastructure services, see Overview of Our Industries - Electrical Infrastructure Industry\u201d above. Revenue from our operations in the continental United States increased $58 million, or 96%, to $118 million for 2019 from $60 million for 2018.\nPressure Pumping Services. Pressure pumping services division revenue decreased $123 million, or 33%, to $246 million for 2019 from $369 million for 2018. Revenue derived from related parties was $91 million, or 37% of total pressure pumping revenue, for 2019 and $96 million, or 26% of total pressure pumping revenue, for 2018. Substantially all of our related party revenue is derived from Gulfport under a pressure pumping contract. For additional information regarding the status of this contract, see Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. Intersegment revenue, consisting primarily of revenue derived from our sand segment, totaled $4 million and $7 million, respectively, for 2019 and 2018.\nThe decrease in our pressure pumping services revenue was primarily driven by a decline in pricing as well as a decline in utilization. The number of stages completed decreased 14% to 5,378 for 2019 from 6,245 for 2018. An average of 2.4 of our fleets were active throughout 2019 compared to 3.6 fleets for 2018.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services. Natural sand proppant services division revenue decreased $68 million, or 40%, to $100 million for 2019, from $168 million for 2018. Revenue derived from related parties was $28 million, or 28% of total sand revenue, for 2019 and $25 million, or 15% of total sand revenue, for 2018. All of our related party revenue is derived from Gulfport under a contract effective through December 31, 2021. Intersegment revenue, consisting primarily of revenue derived from our pressure pumping segment, totaled $30 million, or 30% of total sand revenue, for 2019"}
