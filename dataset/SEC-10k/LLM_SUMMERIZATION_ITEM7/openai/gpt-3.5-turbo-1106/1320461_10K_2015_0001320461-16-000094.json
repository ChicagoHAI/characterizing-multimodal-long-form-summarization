Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding and assessing the trends and significant changes in our results of operations and financial condition. Our historical results may not indicate, and should not be relied upon as an indication of, our future performance. Our forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events, are based on assumptions and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. See Item 1. Business-Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of risks associated with reliance on forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause differences between actual results and those contemplated by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 6.\u201d Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCompany Overview\nWe design, manufacture and sell sealing, fuel and brake delivery, fluid transfer and anti-vibration systems for use in passenger vehicles and light trucks manufactured by global OEMs. In 2015, approximately 82% of our sales consisted of original equipment sold directly to OEMs for installation on new vehicles. The remaining 18% of our sales were primarily to Tier I and Tier II suppliers and non-automotive manufacturers. Accordingly, sales of our products are directly affected by the annual vehicle production of OEMs and, in particular, the production levels of the vehicles for which we provide specific parts. Most of our products are custom designed and engineered for a specific vehicle platform. Our sales and product development personnel frequently work directly with the OEMs' engineering departments in the design and development of our various products.\nAlthough each OEM may emphasize different requirements as the primary criteria for judging its suppliers, we believe success as an automotive supplier generally requires outstanding performance with respect to price, quality, service, performance, design and engineering capabilities, innovation, timely delivery and an extensive global footprint. Also, we believe our continued commitment to invest in global common processes is an important factor in servicing global customers with the same quality and consistency of product wherever we produce in the world. This is especially important when supplying products for global platforms.\nIn addition, to remain competitive, we must also consistently achieve and sustain cost savings. In an ongoing effort to reduce our cost structure, we run a global continuous improvement program which includes training for our employees, as well as implementation of lean tools, structured problem solving, best business practices, standardized processes and change management. We also evaluate opportunities to consolidate facilities and to relocate certain operations to lower cost countries. We believe we will continue to be successful in our efforts to improve our design and engineering capability and manufacturing processes while achieving cost savings, including through our continuous improvement initiatives.\nOur OEM sales are principally generated from purchase orders issued by OEMs and as a result, we have typically have no order backlog. Once selected by an OEM to supply products for a particular platform, we typically supply those products for the life of the platform, which is normally three to five years (although there is no guarantee that this will occur). In addition, when we are the incumbent supplier to a given platform, we believe we have a competitive advantage in winning the redesign or replacement platform.\nIn 2015, approximately 53% of our sales were generated in North America. Because of our significant international operations, we are subject to the risks associated with doing business in other countries, such as currency volatility, high interest and inflation rates, and the general political and economic risk that are associated with some of these markets.\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nAccording to the forecasting firm IHS, global light vehicle sales were approximately 88 million units in 2015, reflecting a slight fall-off in emerging markets. Looking forward, vehicle sales are expected to surpass 100 million units by 2021.\nWe expect that much of the projected growth will be driven by emerging markets such as Greater China, Brazil and Southeast Asia. Furthermore, we anticipate that North American sales will remain stable over the next few years, while Europe is projected to continue to stabilize and no longer dampen overall global sales growth.\nSeveral factors will present significant opportunities for automotive suppliers who are positioned for the changing environment, such as:\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>continued shift to global platforms;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>consolidation of suppliers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increased government regulation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>intensified consumer demand for advanced technological features in vehicles.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our business is directly affected by the automotive build rates in North America, Europe, the Asia Pacific region and South America. New vehicle demand is driven by macro-economic and other factors, such as interest rates, manufacturer and dealer sales incentives, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment levels, income growth trends and government and tax incentives.\nThe global automotive industry remains susceptible to uncertain economic conditions that could adversely impact new vehicle demand. While the U.S. economy remains strong, and the European economy shows indications of improvement, global economic sentiment remains cautious given continued geopolitical uncertainty, oil supply and demand issues and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Ongoing volatility within the emerging markets, including declining economic conditions in Brazil and the slowing pace of economic growth in China, have impacted light vehicle production volume in recent periods.\nDetails on light vehicle production in certain regions for 2015 and 2014, as well as projections for 2016, are provided in the following table:\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions of units)\n</td> <td>2016(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change 2014-2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>18.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific(2)\n</td> <td>46.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South America\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Production data based on IHS Automotive, January 2016.\n(2) Includes China units of 25.3, 23.9, and 23.0 for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCompetition in the automotive supplier industry is intense and has increased in recent years as OEMs have demonstrated a preference for stronger relationships with fewer suppliers. There are typically three or more significant competitors and numerous smaller competitors for most of the products we produce. Automotive suppliers with a global manufacturing footprint capable of fully servicing customers around the world will continue to lead the supply industry going forward.\nOEMs have shifted some research and development, design and testing responsibility to suppliers, while at the same time shortening new product cycle times. To remain competitive, suppliers must have state-of-the-art engineering and design capabilities and must be able to continuously improve their engineering, design and manufacturing processes to effectively service the customer. Suppliers are increasingly expected to collaborate on, or assume the product design and development of, key automotive components and to provide innovative solutions to meet evolving technologies aimed at improved emissions and fuel economy.\nPricing pressure has continued as competition for market share has reduced the overall profitability of the industry and resulted in continued pressure on suppliers for price reductions. Consolidations and market share shifts among vehicle manufacturers continues to put additional pressures on the supply chain. These pricing and market pressures will continue to drive our focus on reducing our overall cost structure through continuous improvement initiatives, capital redeployment, restructuring and other cost management processes.\nResults of Operations\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,342,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,243,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,090,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>2,755,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,734,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,617,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>587,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>509,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>472,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, administration & engineering expenses\n</td> <td>329,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>301,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>293,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>13,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>21,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>53,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating profit\n</td> <td>(8,033\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,927\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>175,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net of interest income\n</td> <td>(38,331\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45,604\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(54,921\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity earnings\n</td> <td>5,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>9,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36,658\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,437\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>152,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>41,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>111,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,694\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year ended December 31, 2014.\nSales.

Sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $186.0 million, or 74.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the Shenya acquisition which was completed February 27, 2015, and improved sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of $11.7 million. Segment profit increased by $0.5 million, primarily due to improved sales volume and mix, the Shenya acquisition and the favorable impact of continuous improvement and material costs savings, partially offset by higher engineering and administrative costs to support growth in the region as well as higher incentive compensation due to favorable operating results.\nSouth America. Sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $62.1 million or 39.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange of $36.8 million and a decrease in sales volumes. Segment loss increased by $20.3 million, primarily due to impairment charges at two facilities and the write off of customer relationships that were impaired, a decrease in sales volume and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by the favorable impact of continuous improvement savings.\nYear ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013.\nNorth America. Sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $80.8 million or 5.0%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in sales volume. In addition, sales were favorably impacted by the Jyco acquisition, which was completed July 31, 2013. These items were partially offset by customer price reductions, the sale of our thermal and emissions product line, and unfavorable foreign exchange of $21.8 million. Segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $2.0 million, primarily due to the favorable impact of continuous improvement savings, increased sales volume and material cost savings, partially offset by the loss on extinguishment of debt, impairment charges, customer price reductions, and higher staffing costs.\nEurope. Sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $62.3 million, or 5.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in sales volume and favorable foreign exchange of $2.5 million, which were partially offset by customer price reductions and the sale of our thermal and emissions product line. Segment loss improved by $12.0 million, primarily due to increased sales volume, and the favorable impact of continuous improvement and material cost savings, which were partially offset by the loss on extinguishment of debt, impairment charges, customer price reductions and higher staffing costs.\nAsia Pacific. Sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $29.3 million, or 13.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in sales volume. In addition, sales were favorably impacted by the Jyco acquisition, which was completed July 31, 2013. These items were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of $2.1 million and customer price reductions. Segment profit decreased by $4.6 million, primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt, higher staffing costs and customer price reductions, which were partially offset by increased volumes and the favorable impact of continuous improvement and material cost savings.\nSouth America. Sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased $19.0 million, or 10.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to a decrease in sales volumes and unfavorable foreign exchange of $9.9 million. Segment loss increased by $11.9 million, primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt, and a decrease in sales volume.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nShort and Long-Term Liquidity Considerations and Risks\nWe intend to fund our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other funding requirements through a combination of cash flows from operations, cash on hand, borrowings under our Senior ABL Facility, and receivables factoring. We anticipate that these funding sources will be sufficient to meet our needs for the next twelve months. The Company utilizes intercompany loans and equity contributions to fund its worldwide operations. There may be country specific regulations\nwhich may restrict or result in increased costs in the repatriation of these funds. See Note 7. Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nBased on our current and anticipated levels of operations and the condition in our markets and industry, we believe that our cash flows from operations, cash on hand, borrowings under our Senior ABL Facility and receivables factoring will enable us to meet our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other funding requirements for the next twelve months. However, our ability to fund our working capital needs, debt payments and other obligations, and to comply with the financial covenants, including borrowing base limitations, under our Senior ABL Facility, depends on our future operating performance and cash flow and many factors outside of our control, including the costs of raw materials, the state of the overall automotive industry and financial and economic conditions and other factors.\nCash Flows\nOperating activities. Net cash provided by operations was $270.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which included $36.6 million of cash provided by operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operations was primarily the result of increased earnings, as well as changes in accounts and tooling receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $63.9 million. In addition, pension contributions of $7.9 million were made during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash provided by operations was $171.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which included $43.1 million of cash used that related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. The use of cash related to operating assets and liabilities was primarily a result of changes in accounts receivable and tooling receivables and accounts payable of $29.4 million and pension contributions of $12.2 million.\nInvesting activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $166.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which consisted primarily of $166.3 million of capital spending, $34.4 million for the Shenya acquisition and $4.3 million for investment in joint ventures, offset by proceeds of $33.5 million for the sale of our hard coat plastic exterior trim business and $5.1 million for the sale of fixed assets and other. Net cash used in investing activities was $157.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which consisted primarily of $192.1 million of capital spending and $21.2 million for the acquisition of businesses, offset by proceeds of $50.6 million from the sale of our thermal and emissions product line, the Australian business and the sale of an investment in affiliate, proceeds of $4.4 million for the sale of fixed assets and other, and a $1.0 million return on equity investments. We anticipate that we will spend approximately $155 million to $165 million on capital expenditures in 2016.\nFinancing activities. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which consisted primarily of a decrease in short term debt of $9.0 million, payments on long term debt of $8.9 million, taxes withheld and paid on employees' share based awards of $2.0 million, and the purchase of noncontrolling interests of $1.3 million, partially offset by $9.3 million related to the exercise of stock warrants. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $49.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which consisted primarily of $737.5 million related to the proceeds from issuance of long-term debt, $9.0 million related to the exercise of stock warrants, increase in long-term debt of $6.6 million and excess tax benefit on stock options exercised of $4.1 million, partially offset by the repurchase of the Senior Notes and the Senior PIK Toggle Notes of $675.6 million, purchase of noncontrolling interest of $18.5 million, payments on long-term debt of $4.3 million, repurchase of common stock of $5.2 million and taxes withheld and paid on employees' share based awards of $4.2 million.\nFinancing Arrangements\nSenior ABL Facility\nOn April 4, 2014, CS Intermediate Holdco 1 LLC ( Parent\u201d), CSA U.S. (the U.S. Borrower\u201d), Cooper-Standard Automotive Canada Limited (the Canadian Borrower\u201d), Cooper-Standard Automotive International Holdings BV (the European Borrower\u201d and, together with the U.S. Borrower and Canadian Borrower, the Borrowers\u201d), and certain subsidiaries of the U.S. Borrower entered into the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement in connection with its Senior ABL Facility, with certain lenders, Bank of America, N.A., as agent (the Agent\u201d) for such lenders, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as syndication agent, and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and bookrunners. On June 11, 2014, the Parent and the Borrowers entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Second Amended and Restated Senior ABL Facility. A summary of our Senior ABL Facility is set forth below. This description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the credit agreement governing our Senior ABL Facility.\nGeneral. Our Senior ABL Facility provides for an aggregate revolving loan availability of up to $180.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability, including a $60.0 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $25.0 million swing line sub-facility. Our Senior ABL Facility also provides for an uncommitted $75.0 million incremental loan facility, for a potential total Senior ABL Facility of $255.0 million (if requested by the Borrowers and the lenders agree to fund such increase). No consent of any\nlender (other than those participating in the increase) is required to effect any such increase. On December 31, 2015, there were no borrowings under the Senior ABL Facility, and subject to borrowing base availability, the Company had $180.0 million in availability, less outstanding letters of credit of $42.6 million.\nMaturity. Any borrowings under our Senior ABL Facility will mature, and the commitments of the lenders under our Senior ABL Facility will terminate, on March 1, 2018.\nBorrowing base. Loan and letter of credit availability under our Senior ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base, which at any time is limited to the lesser of: (A) the maximum facility amount (subject to certain adjustments) and (B) (i) up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable; plus (ii) the lesser of 70% of eligible inventory or 85% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory; minus reserves established by the Agent. The accounts receivable portion of the borrowing base is subject to certain formulaic limitations (including concentration limits). The inventory portion of the borrowing base is limited to eligible inventory, as determined by the Agent. The borrowing base is also subject to certain reserves, which are established by the Agent (which may include changes to the advance rates indicated above). Loan availability under our Senior ABL Facility is apportioned as follows: $150.0 million to the U.S. Borrower., which includes a $60.0 million sublimit to the European Borrower and $30.0 million to the Canadian Borrower.\nGuarantees; security. Obligations under our Senior ABL Facility and cash management arrangements and hedging arrangements, in each case with the lenders and their affiliates (collectively Additional ABL Secured Obligations\u201d) entered into by the U.S. Borrower are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Company and all of its U.S. subsidiaries. Obligations of the Canadian Borrower under our Senior ABL Facility and Additional ABL Secured Obligations of the Canadian Borrower and its Canadian subsidiaries are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Company, its U.S. subsidiaries and the Canadian Borrower and Canadian subsidiaries. Obligations of the European Borrower under our Senior ABL Facility and Additional ABL Secured Obligations of the European Borrower are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Parent and its U.S. subsidiaries. The obligations under our Senior ABL Facility and related guarantees are secured by (1) a first priority lien on all of each Borrower's and each guarantor's existing and future personal property consisting of accounts receivable, payment intangibles, inventory, documents, instruments, chattel paper and investment property, certain money, deposit accounts, securities accounts, letters of credit, commercial tort claims and certain related assets and proceeds of the foregoing and (2) a second priority lien on all the capital stock in restricted subsidiaries directly held by the U.S. Borrower and each of the U.S. Guarantors, substantially all material owned real property located in the U.S. and equipment of the U.S. Borrower and the U.S. Guarantors and all other material personal property of the U.S. Borrower and the U.S. Guarantors.\nInterest. Borrowings under our Senior ABL Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Borrowers' option:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in the case of borrowings by the U.S. Borrower, LIBOR or the base rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in the case of borrowings by the Canadian Borrower, bankers' acceptance ( BA\u201d) rate, Canadian prime rate or Canadian base rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in the case of borrowings by the European Borrower, LIBOR plus an applicable margin.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The applicable margin may vary between 1.50% and 2.00% with respect to the LIBOR or BA-based borrowings and between 0.50% and 1.00% with respect to base rate, Canadian prime rate and Canadian base rate borrowings. The applicable margin is subject, in each case, to quarterly pricing adjustments based on usage over the immediately preceding quarter.\nIn addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under our Senior ABL Facility, the Borrowers are required to pay a fee in respect of committed but unused commitments. The Borrowers are also required to pay a fee on outstanding letters of credit under our Senior ABL Facility together with customary issuance and other letter of credit fees. Our Senior ABL Facility also required the payment of customary agency and administrative fees.\nThe Borrowers are able to voluntarily reduce the unutilized portion of the commitment amount and repay outstanding loans, in each case, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary breakage and related reemployment costs with respect to repayments of any outstanding borrowings).\nCovenants; Events of Default. Our Senior ABL Facility includes affirmative and negative covenants that impose substantial restrictions on our financial and business operations, including our ability to incur and secure debt, make investments, sell assets, pay dividends or make acquisitions. Our Senior ABL Facility also includes a requirement to maintain a monthly fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.0 to 1.0 when availability under our Senior ABL Facility is less than specified levels or an event of default has occurred. Our Senior ABL Facility also contains various events of default that are customary for comparable facilities.\nOur current revenue forecast for 2016 is determined from specific platform volume projections consistent with a North American and European light vehicle production estimate of 18.2 million units and 21.2 million units, respectively. Adverse\nchanges to the vehicle production levels could have a negative impact on our future sales, liquidity, results of operations and ability to comply with our debt covenants under our Senior ABL Facility or any future financing arrangements we enter into. In addition to the potential impact of changes on our sales, our current operating performance and future compliance with the covenants under our Senior ABL Facility or any future financing arrangements we enter into are dependent upon a number of other external and internal factors, such as changes in raw material costs, changes in foreign currency rates, our ability to execute our cost savings initiatives, our ability to implement and achieve the savings expected by the changes in our operating structure and other factors beyond our control.\nTerm Loan Facility\nOn April 4, 2014, certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into a Term Loan Facility in order to (i) refinance the 81/2% Senior Notes due 2018 ( Senior Notes\u201d) and 7 3/8% Senior PIK Toggle Notes due 2018 ( Senior PIK Toggle Notes\u201d), including applicable call premiums and accrued and unpaid interest, (ii) pay related fees and expenses and (iii) provide for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The Term Loan Facility provides for loans in an aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million and may be increased (or a new term loan facility added) by an amount that will not cause the consolidated first lien debt ratio to exceed 2.25 to 1.00 plus $300.0 million. All obligations of the borrower are guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior secured basis by the direct parent company of the borrower and each existing and subsequently acquired direct or indirect wholly-owned U.S. restricted subsidiary of the borrower. The obligations are secured by amongst other items (a) a first priority security interest (subject to permitted liens and other customary exceptions) on (i) all the capital stock in restricted subsidiaries directly held by the borrower and each of the guarantors (limited to 65% of the capital stock of any Foreign subsidiaries), (ii) substantially all plant, material owned real property located in the U.S. and equipment of the borrower and the guarantors and (iii) all other personal property of the borrower and the guarantors, and (b) a second priority security interest (subject to permitted liens and other customary exceptions) in accounts receivable of the borrowers and the guarantors arising from the sale of goods and services, inventory, excluding certain collateral and subject to certain limitations. Loans under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Borrower's option, LIBOR, subject to a 1.00% LIBOR Floor, plus an applicable margin of 3.00% or the base rate option (the highest of the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, prime rate, or one-month Eurodollar rate plus 1.00%), plus an applicable margin of 2.00%. The Term Loan Facility matures on April 4, 2021. On April 4, 2014, the aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million was fully drawn to extinguish the Senior PIK Toggle Notes and the Senior Notes and to pay related fees and expenses. Debt issuance costs of approximately $7.9 million were incurred on this transaction, along with the original issue discount of $3.8 million. Both the debt issuance costs and the original issue discount will be amortized into interest expense over the term of the Term Loan Facility. As of December 31, 2015, the principal amount of $738.8 million was outstanding. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had $2.8 million of unamortized original issue discount.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs a part of our working capital management, we sell certain receivables through third party financial institutions without recourse. The amount sold varies each month based on the amount of underlying receivables and cash flow needs. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $63.5 million and $96.0 million, respectively, of receivables outstanding under receivable transfer agreements entered into by various locations. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, total accounts receivables factored were $264.8 million and $509.3 million, respectively. Costs incurred on the sale of receivables were $2.1 million, $3.3 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These amounts are recorded in other income (expense), net and interest expense, net of interest income in the consolidated statements of net income. These are permitted transactions under our credit agreement governing our Senior ABL Facility and Term Loan Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had no other material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nWorking capital\nHistorically, we have not generally experienced difficulties in collecting our accounts receivable, other than the dynamics associated with a global economic downturn which impact both the amount of our receivables and adversely impacts the ability of our customers to pay within normal terms. We believe that we currently have a strong working capital position. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $378.2 million.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual cash obligations consist of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments, regardless of the contractual requirements of the vendor to provide future goods or services. Except as otherwise disclosed, this table does not include information on our recurring purchase of materials for use in production because our raw materials purchase contracts typically do not require fixed or minimum quantities.\nThe following table summarizes the total amounts due as of December 31, 2015 under all debt agreements, commitments and other contractual obligations. Table 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payment due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>738.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>701.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on debt obligations\n</td> <td>155.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>85.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other obligations (1)\n</td> <td>48.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,027.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>725.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Represents borrowings and capital lease obligations.\nIn addition to our contractual obligations and commitments set forth in the table above, we have employment arrangements with certain key executives that provide for continuity of management. These arrangements include payments of multiples of annual salary, certain incentives and continuation of benefits upon the occurrence of specified events in a manner that is believed to be consistent with comparable companies.\nWe also have minimum funding requirements with respect to our pension obligations. We expect to make minimum cash contributions of approximately $2.3 million to our foreign pension plan asset portfolios in 2016. We do not expect to make cash contributions to our U.S. pension plans in 2016. Our minimum funding requirements after 2016 will depend on several factors, including the investment performance of our retirement plans and prevailing interest rates. Our funding obligations may also be affected by changes in applicable legal requirements. Further, we expect to make cash contributions of $3.9 million to certain of our unfunded pension plans in 2016. We also have payments due with respect to our postretirement benefit obligations. We do not prefund our postretirement benefit obligations. Rather, payments are made as costs are incurred by covered retirees. We expect other postretirement benefit net payments to be approximately $2.6 million in 2016.\nWe may be required to make significant cash outlays due to our unrecognized tax benefits. However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $7.8 million as of December 31, 2015 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Note 10. Income Taxes\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nIn addition, excluded from the contractual obligation table are open purchase orders at December 31, 2015 for raw materials, supplies and capital expenditures in the normal course of business, supply contracts with customers, distribution agreements, joint venture agreements and other contracts without express funding requirements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn evaluating our business, management considers EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be key indicators of our operating performance. Our management also uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>because similar measures are utilized in the calculation of the financial covenants and ratios contained in our financing arrangements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in developing our internal budgets and forecasts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>as a significant factor in evaluating our management for compensation purposes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in evaluating potential acquisitions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in comparing our current operating results with corresponding historical periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in presentations to the members of our board of directors to enable our board of directors to have the same measurement basis of operating performance as is used by management in their assessments of performance and in forecasting and budgeting for our company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition, we believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating our performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, net of interest income, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA, as adjusted for items that management does not consider to be reflective of our core operating performance. These adjustments include, but are\nnot limited to, restructuring costs, impairment charges, non-cash fair value adjustments, acquisition related costs and non-cash stock based compensation.\nWe calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by adjusting net income (loss) to eliminate the impact of items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not financial measurements recognized under U.S. GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, investors should use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to, and not as alternatives for, net income (loss), operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.

We manage the procurement of our raw materials to assure supply and to obtain the most favorable total cost of ownership. Procurement arrangements include short-term and long-term supply agreements that may contain formula-based pricing based on commodity indices. These arrangements provide quantities needed to satisfy normal manufacturing demands.\nWe believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our products with suppliers located around the world. We often use offshore suppliers for machined components, die castings and other labor-intensive, economically freighted products in our North American and European facilities.\nExtreme fluctuations in material pricing have occurred in recent years, adding challenges in forecasting supply costs. Our inability generally to recover higher than anticipated material costs from our customers could impact our profitability.\nSeasonal Trends\nHistorically, sales to automotive customers are lowest during the months prior to model changeovers and during assembly plant shutdowns. However, economic conditions and consumer demand may change the traditional seasonality of the industry, and lower production may prevail without the impact of seasonality. In the past, model changeover periods have\ntypically resulted in lower sales volumes during July, August and December. During these periods of lower sales volumes, profit performance is reduced but working capital often improves due to the continued collection of accounts receivable.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements. Application of these accounting policies requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that, of our significant accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or estimation than other accounting policies.\nPre-Production Costs Related to Long Term Supply Arrangements. Costs for molds, dies and other tools owned by us to produce products under long-term supply arrangements are recorded at cost in property, plant, and equipment and amortized over the lesser of three years or the term of the related supply agreement. We expense all pre-production tooling costs related to customer-owned tools for which reimbursement is not contractually guaranteed by the customer.\nGoodwill. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had recorded goodwill of approximately $149.2 million and $135.2 million, respectively. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment, either annually or when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. We evaluate each reporting unit's fair value versus its carrying value annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair value of the reporting unit. Estimated fair values are based on the cash flows projected in the reporting units' strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts discounted at a risk-adjusted rate of return. We assess the reasonableness of these estimated fair values using market based multiples of comparable companies. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. Goodwill fair value measurements are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, which are generally determined using unobservable inputs. We conduct our annual goodwill impairment as of October 1st of each year.\nOur annual goodwill impairment analysis, completed as of the first day of the fourth quarter, resulted in no impairment for 2015 or 2014.\nLong-Lived Assets. We monitor our long-lived assets for impairment indicators on an ongoing basis in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment.\u201d If impairment indicators exist, we perform the required analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets to the related net book values. If the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long-lived assets. Fair value is estimated based upon either discounted cash flow analysis or estimated salvage values. Cash flows are estimated using internal budgets based on recent sales data, independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments, as well as assumptions related to discount rates. Changes in economic or operating conditions impacting these estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of long-lived assets. During 2015, we impaired property, plant and equipment at our South American and European facilities with a carrying value of $36.2 million to their fair value of $22.6 million, resulting in an impairment charge of $13.6 million. Fair value was determined using the estimated salvage values. Additionally, customer relationship intangible assets in South America were fully impaired, resulting in an impairment charge of $8.0 million.\nRestructuring. Specific accruals have been recorded in connection with restructuring initiatives. These accruals include estimates principally related to employee separation costs, the closure and/or consolidation of facilities, contractual obligations and the valuation of certain assets. Actual amounts recognized could differ from the original estimates. Restructuring-related reserves are reviewed on a quarterly basis, and changes to plans are appropriately recognized when identified. Changes to plans associated with the restructuring of existing businesses are generally recognized as employee separation and plant phase-out costs in the period the change occurs. See Note 4. Restructuring\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition and Sales Commitments. We generally enter into agreements with our customers to produce products at the beginning of a vehicle's life. Although such agreements do not generally provide for minimum quantities, once we enter into such agreements, fulfillment of our customers' purchasing requirements can be our obligation for an extended period or the entire production life of the vehicle. These agreements generally may be terminated by our customer at any time. Historically, terminations of these agreements have been minimal. In certain limited instances, we may be committed under existing agreements to supply products to our customers at selling prices which are not sufficient to cover the direct cost to produce such products. In such situations, we recognize losses as they are incurred.\nWe receive blanket purchase orders from many of our customers on an annual basis. Generally, such purchase orders and related documents set forth the annual terms, including pricing, related to a particular vehicle model. Such purchase orders generally do not specify quantities. We recognize revenue based on the pricing terms included in our annual purchase orders as our products are shipped to our customers. As part of certain agreements, we are asked to provide our customers with annual cost reductions. We accrue for such amounts as a reduction of revenue as our products are shipped to our customers. In addition, we generally have ongoing adjustments to our pricing arrangements with our customers based on the related content and cost of our products. Such pricing accruals are adjusted as they are settled with our customers.\nIncome Taxes. In determining the provision for income taxes for financial statement purposes, we make estimates and judgments which affect our evaluation of the carrying value of our deferred tax assets as well as our calculation of certain tax liabilities. In accordance with ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, we evaluate the carrying value of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. In completing this evaluation, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Such evidence includes historical operating results, the existence of cumulative earnings and losses in the most recent fiscal years, expectations for future pretax operating income, the time period over which our temporary differences will reverse, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of this evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods.\nConcluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years. The Company utilizes three years cumulative pre-tax book results adjusted for significant permanent book to tax differences as a measure of cumulative results in recent years. In certain foreign jurisdictions, our analysis indicates that we have cumulative three year historical losses on this basis. This is considered significant negative evidence which is difficult to overcome. However, the three-year loss position is not solely determinative, and, accordingly, management considers all other available positive and negative evidence in its analysis. Based upon this analysis, management concluded that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions may not be realized in the future. Accordingly, the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance related to those net deferred tax assets.\nWe continue to maintain a valuation allowance related to our net deferred tax assets in several foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2015, we had valuation allowances of $137.0 million related to tax loss and credit carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in several foreign jurisdictions. Our valuation allowance decreased in 2015 primarily as a result of foreign currency, as well as the release of valuation allowances against our net deferred tax asset in certain foreign jurisdictions partially offset by current year losses with no benefit in certain foreign jurisdictions. The effective tax rate in the year ended December 31, 2015 was impacted by a tax benefit of $14.9 million resulting from changes in judgment related to deferred tax asset valuation allowances. Our current and future provision for income taxes is significantly impacted by the initial recognition of and changes in valuation allowances in certain countries. We intend to maintain these allowances until it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our future provision for income taxes will include no tax benefit with respect to losses incurred and no tax expense with respect to income generated in these countries until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated.\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities includes uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize tax benefits and liabilities based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due. We adjust these liabilities based on changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties and the impact of any tax audits, the ultimate resolutions may be materially different from our estimated liabilities. See Note 10. \"Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nPensions and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. Included in our results of operations are significant pension and postretirement benefit costs, which are measured using actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including assumptions about discount rates and expected returns on plan assets. These assumptions are determined as of the current year measurement date. We are required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making these assumptions. Changes in pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Our net pension and postretirement benefit costs were approximately $4.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTo develop the discount rate for each plan, the expected cash flows underlying the plan's benefit obligations were discounted using a December 31, 2015 pension index to determine a single equivalent rate. To develop our expected return on plan assets, we considered historical long-term asset return experience, the expected investment portfolio mix of plan assets and an estimate of long-term investment returns. To develop our portfolio of plan assets, we considered the duration of the plan liabilities and gave more weight to equity positions, including both public and private equity investments, than to fixed-income securities. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 1% increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the fiscal 2016 net periodic benefit cost expense by approximately $0.9 million or $1.2 million, respectively. Likewise, a 1% increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the fiscal 2016 net periodic benefit cost by approximately $3.1 million. Decreasing or increasing the discount rate by 1% would have increased or decreased the projected benefit obligations by approximately $67.9 million or $54.9 million, respectively. Aggregate pension net periodic benefit cost is forecasted to be approximately $6.7 million in 2016.\nThe expected annual rate of increase in health care costs is approximately 5.97% for 2015 (5.96% for the United States, 6.00% for Canada), grading down to 5% in 2018, and was held constant at 5.00% for years past 2018. These trend rates were assumed to reflect market trend, actual experience and future expectations. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. Only certain employees hired are eligible to participate in our subsidized postretirement plan. A 1% change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have increased or decreased the fiscal 2016 service and interest cost components by $0.2 million in each case, and the projected benefit obligations would have increased or decreased by $3.1 million or $2.5 million, respectively. Aggregate other postretirement net periodic benefit cost is forecasted to be approximately $0.7 million in 2016.\nThe general funding policy is to contribute amounts deductible for United States federal income tax purposes or amounts required by local statute.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding and assessing the trends and significant changes in our results of operations and financial condition. Our historical results may not indicate, and should not be relied upon as an indication of, our future performance. Our forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events, are based on assumptions and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. See Item 1. Business-Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of risks associated with reliance on forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause differences between actual results and those contemplated by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 6.\u201d Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCompany Overview\nWe design, manufacture and sell sealing, fuel and brake delivery, fluid transfer and anti-vibration systems for use in passenger vehicles and light trucks manufactured by global OEMs. In 2015, approximately 82% of our sales consisted of original equipment sold directly to OEMs for installation on new vehicles. The remaining 18% of our sales were primarily to Tier I and Tier II suppliers and non-automotive manufacturers. Accordingly, sales of our products are directly affected by the annual vehicle production of OEMs and, in particular, the production levels of the vehicles for which we provide specific parts. Most of our products are custom designed and engineered for a specific vehicle platform. Our sales and product development personnel frequently work directly with the OEMs' engineering departments in the design and development of our various products.\nAlthough each OEM may emphasize different requirements as the primary criteria for judging its suppliers, we believe success as an automotive supplier generally requires outstanding performance with respect to price, quality, service, performance, design and engineering capabilities, innovation, timely delivery and an extensive global footprint. Also, we believe our continued commitment to invest in global common processes is an important factor in servicing global customers with the same quality and consistency of product wherever we produce in the world. This is especially important when supplying products for global platforms.\nIn addition, to remain competitive, we must also consistently achieve and sustain cost savings. In an ongoing effort to reduce our cost structure, we run a global continuous improvement program which includes training for our employees, as well as implementation of lean tools, structured problem solving, best business practices, standardized processes and change management. We also evaluate opportunities to consolidate facilities and to relocate certain operations to lower cost countries. We believe we will continue to be successful in our efforts to improve our design and engineering capability and manufacturing processes while achieving cost savings, including through our continuous improvement initiatives.\nOur OEM sales are principally generated from purchase orders issued by OEMs and as a result, we have typically have no order backlog. Once selected by an OEM to supply products for a particular platform, we typically supply those products for the life of the platform, which is normally three to five years (although there is no guarantee that this will occur). In addition, when we are the incumbent supplier to a given platform, we believe we have a competitive advantage in winning the redesign or replacement platform.\nIn 2015, approximately 53% of our sales were generated in North America. Because of our significant international operations, we are subject to the risks associated with doing business in other countries, such as currency volatility, high interest and inflation rates, and the general political and economic risk that are associated with some of these markets.\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nAccording to the forecasting firm IHS, global light vehicle sales were approximately 88 million units in 2015, reflecting a slight fall-off in emerging markets. Looking forward, vehicle sales are expected to surpass 100 million units by 2021.\nWe expect that much of the projected growth will be driven by emerging markets such as Greater China, Brazil and Southeast Asia. Furthermore, we anticipate that North American sales will remain stable over the next few years, while Europe is projected to continue to stabilize and no longer dampen overall global sales growth.\nSeveral factors will present significant opportunities for automotive suppliers who are positioned for the changing environment, such as:\n \u2022 continued shift to global platforms; \n \u2022 consolidation of suppliers; \n \u2022 increased government regulation; and \n \u2022 intensified consumer demand for advanced technological features in vehicles.  Our business is directly affected by the automotive build rates in North America, Europe, the Asia Pacific region and South America. New vehicle demand is driven by macro-economic and other factors, such as interest rates, manufacturer and dealer sales incentives, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment levels, income growth trends and government and tax incentives.\nThe global automotive industry remains susceptible to uncertain economic conditions that could adversely impact new vehicle demand. While the U.S. economy remains strong, and the European economy shows indications of improvement, global economic sentiment remains cautious given continued geopolitical uncertainty, oil supply and demand issues and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Ongoing volatility within the emerging markets, including declining economic conditions in Brazil and the slowing pace of economic growth in China, have impacted light vehicle production volume in recent periods.\nDetails on light vehicle production in certain regions for 2015 and 2014, as well as projections for 2016, are provided in the following table:\n\n(1) Production data based on IHS Automotive, January 2016.\n(2) Includes China units of 25.3, 23.9, and 23.0 for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCompetition in the automotive supplier industry is intense and has increased in recent years as OEMs have demonstrated a preference for stronger relationships with fewer suppliers. There are typically three or more significant competitors and numerous smaller competitors for most of the products we produce. Automotive suppliers with a global manufacturing footprint capable of fully servicing customers around the world will continue to lead the supply industry going forward.\nOEMs have shifted some research and development, design and testing responsibility to suppliers, while at the same time shortening new product cycle times. To remain competitive, suppliers must have state-of-the-art engineering and design capabilities and must be able to continuously improve their engineering, design and manufacturing processes to effectively service the customer. Suppliers are increasingly expected to collaborate on, or assume the product design and development of, key automotive components and to provide innovative solutions to meet evolving technologies aimed at improved emissions and fuel economy.\nPricing pressure has continued as competition for market share has reduced the overall profitability of the industry and resulted in continued pressure on suppliers for price reductions. Consolidations and market share shifts among vehicle manufacturers continues to put additional pressures on the supply chain. These pricing and market pressures will continue to drive our focus on reducing our overall cost structure through continuous improvement initiatives, capital redeployment, restructuring and other cost management processes.\nResults of Operations\n\nYear ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year ended December 31, 2014.\nSales. Sales were $3,342.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $3,244.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $98.8 million, or 3.0%. Sales were favorably impacted by improved volume and product mix in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, as well as our Shenya acquisition, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of $298.2 million, decreased volumes in South America and customer price reductions.\nCost of Products Sold. Cost of products sold is primarily comprised of material, labor, manufacturing overhead, depreciation and amortization and other direct operating expenses. Cost of products sold was $2,755.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $2,734.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $21.1 million or 0.8%. Materials comprise the largest component of our cost of products sold and represented approximately 50% and 49% of total cost of products sold for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cost of sales was impacted by higher production volumes in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, as well as our Shenya acquisition.

Segment loss increased by $11.9 million, primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt, and a decrease in sales volume.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nShort and Long-Term Liquidity Considerations and Risks\nWe intend to fund our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other funding requirements through a combination of cash flows from operations, cash on hand, borrowings under our Senior ABL Facility, and receivables factoring. We anticipate that these funding sources will be sufficient to meet our needs for the next twelve months. The Company utilizes intercompany loans and equity contributions to fund its worldwide operations. There may be country specific regulations\nwhich may restrict or result in increased costs in the repatriation of these funds. See Note 7. Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nBased on our current and anticipated levels of operations and the condition in our markets and industry, we believe that our cash flows from operations, cash on hand, borrowings under our Senior ABL Facility and receivables factoring will enable us to meet our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other funding requirements for the next twelve months. However, our ability to fund our working capital needs, debt payments and other obligations, and to comply with the financial covenants, including borrowing base limitations, under our Senior ABL Facility, depends on our future operating performance and cash flow and many factors outside of our control, including the costs of raw materials, the state of the overall automotive industry and financial and economic conditions and other factors.\nCash Flows\nOperating activities. Net cash provided by operations was $270.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which included $36.6 million of cash provided by operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operations was primarily the result of increased earnings, as well as changes in accounts and tooling receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $63.9 million. In addition, pension contributions of $7.9 million were made during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash provided by operations was $171.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which included $43.1 million of cash used that related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. The use of cash related to operating assets and liabilities was primarily a result of changes in accounts receivable and tooling receivables and accounts payable of $29.4 million and pension contributions of $12.2 million.\nInvesting activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $166.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which consisted primarily of $166.3 million of capital spending, $34.4 million for the Shenya acquisition and $4.3 million for investment in joint ventures, offset by proceeds of $33.5 million for the sale of our hard coat plastic exterior trim business and $5.1 million for the sale of fixed assets and other. Net cash used in investing activities was $157.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which consisted primarily of $192.1 million of capital spending and $21.2 million for the acquisition of businesses, offset by proceeds of $50.6 million from the sale of our thermal and emissions product line, the Australian business and the sale of an investment in affiliate, proceeds of $4.4 million for the sale of fixed assets and other, and a $1.0 million return on equity investments. We anticipate that we will spend approximately $155 million to $165 million on capital expenditures in 2016.\nFinancing activities. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which consisted primarily of a decrease in short term debt of $9.0 million, payments on long term debt of $8.9 million, taxes withheld and paid on employees' share based awards of $2.0 million, and the purchase of noncontrolling interests of $1.3 million, partially offset by $9.3 million related to the exercise of stock warrants.

Accordingly, sales of our products are directly affected by the annual vehicle production of OEMs and, in particular, the production levels of the vehicles for which we provide specific parts. Most of our products are custom designed and engineered for a specific vehicle platform. Our sales and product development personnel frequently work directly with the OEMs' engineering departments in the design and development of our various products.\nAlthough each OEM may emphasize different requirements as the primary criteria for judging its suppliers, we believe success as an automotive supplier generally requires outstanding performance with respect to price, quality, service, performance, design and engineering capabilities, innovation, timely delivery and an extensive global footprint. Also, we believe our continued commitment to invest in global common processes is an important factor in servicing global customers with the same quality and consistency of product wherever we produce in the world. This is especially important when supplying products for global platforms.\nIn addition, to remain competitive, we must also consistently achieve and sustain cost savings. In an ongoing effort to reduce our cost structure, we run a global continuous improvement program which includes training for our employees, as well as implementation of lean tools, structured problem solving, best business practices, standardized processes and change management. We also evaluate opportunities to consolidate facilities and to relocate certain operations to lower cost countries. We believe we will continue to be successful in our efforts to improve our design and engineering capability and manufacturing processes while achieving cost savings, including through our continuous improvement initiatives.\nOur OEM sales are principally generated from purchase orders issued by OEMs and as a result, we have typically have no order backlog. Once selected by an OEM to supply products for a particular platform, we typically supply those products for the life of the platform, which is normally three to five years (although there is no guarantee that this will occur). In addition, when we are the incumbent supplier to a given platform, we believe we have a competitive advantage in winning the redesign or replacement platform.\nIn 2015, approximately 53% of our sales were generated in North America. Because of our significant international operations, we are subject to the risks associated with doing business in other countries, such as currency volatility, high interest and inflation rates, and the general political and economic risk that are associated with some of these markets.\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nAccording to the forecasting firm IHS, global light vehicle sales were approximately 88 million units in 2015, reflecting a slight fall-off in emerging markets. Looking forward, vehicle sales are expected to surpass 100 million units by 2021.\nWe expect that much of the projected growth will be driven by emerging markets such as Greater China, Brazil and Southeast Asia. Furthermore, we anticipate that North American sales will remain stable over the next few years, while Europe is projected to continue to stabilize and no longer dampen overall global sales growth.\nSeveral factors will present significant opportunities for automotive suppliers who are positioned for the changing environment, such as:\n \u2022 continued shift to global platforms; \n \u2022 consolidation of suppliers; \n \u2022 increased government regulation; and \n \u2022 intensified consumer demand for advanced technological features in vehicles.  Our business is directly affected by the automotive build rates in North America, Europe, the Asia Pacific region and South America. New vehicle demand is driven by macro-economic and other factors, such as interest rates, manufacturer and dealer sales incentives, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment levels, income growth trends and government and tax incentives.\nThe global automotive industry remains susceptible to uncertain economic conditions that could adversely impact new vehicle demand. While the U.S. economy remains strong, and the European economy shows indications of improvement, global economic sentiment remains cautious given continued geopolitical uncertainty, oil supply and demand issues and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Ongoing volatility within the emerging markets, including declining economic conditions in Brazil and the slowing pace of economic growth in China, have impacted light vehicle production volume in recent periods.\nDetails on light vehicle production in certain regions for 2015 and 2014, as well as projections for 2016, are provided in the following table:\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions of units)\n</td> <td>2016(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change 2014-2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>18.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific(2)\n</td> <td>46.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South America\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Production data based on IHS Automotive, January 2016.\n(2) Includes China units of 25.3, 23.9, and 23.0 for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCompetition in the automotive supplier industry is intense and has increased in recent years as OEMs have demonstrated a preference for stronger relationships with fewer suppliers. There are typically three or more significant competitors and numerous smaller competitors for most of the products we produce. Automotive suppliers with a global manufacturing footprint capable of fully servicing customers around the world will continue to lead the supply industry going forward.\nOEMs have shifted some research and development, design and testing responsibility to suppliers, while at the same time shortening new product cycle times. To remain competitive, suppliers must have state-of-the-art engineering and design capabilities and must be able to continuously improve their engineering, design and manufacturing processes to effectively service the customer. Suppliers are increasingly expected to collaborate on, or assume the product design and development of, key automotive components and to provide innovative solutions to meet evolving technologies aimed at improved emissions and fuel economy.\nPricing pressure has continued as competition for market share has reduced the overall profitability of the industry and resulted in continued pressure on suppliers for price reductions. Consolidations and market share shifts among vehicle manufacturers continues to put additional pressures on the supply chain. These pricing and market pressures will continue to drive our focus on reducing our overall cost structure through continuous improvement initiatives, capital redeployment, restructuring and other cost management processes.\nResults of Operations\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,342,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,243,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,090,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>2,755,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,734,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,617,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>587,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>509,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>472,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, administration & engineering expenses\n</td> <td>329,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>301,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>293,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>13,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>21,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>53,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating profit\n</td> <td>(8,033\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,927\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>175,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net of interest income\n</td> <td>(38,331\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45,604\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(54,921\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity earnings\n</td> <td>5,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>9,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36,658\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,437\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>152,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>41,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>111,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,694\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year ended December 31, 2014.\nSales.

Segment loss increased by $11.9 million, primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt, and a decrease in sales volume.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nShort and Long-Term Liquidity Considerations and Risks\nWe intend to fund our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other funding requirements through a combination of cash flows from operations, cash on hand, borrowings under our Senior ABL Facility, and receivables factoring. We anticipate that these funding sources will be sufficient to meet our needs for the next twelve months. The Company utilizes intercompany loans and equity contributions to fund its worldwide operations. There may be country specific regulations\nwhich may restrict or result in increased costs in the repatriation of these funds. See Note 7. Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nBased on our current and anticipated levels of operations and the condition in our markets and industry, we believe that our cash flows from operations, cash on hand, borrowings under our Senior ABL Facility and receivables factoring will enable us to meet our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other funding requirements for the next twelve months. However, our ability to fund our working capital needs, debt payments and other obligations, and to comply with the financial covenants, including borrowing base limitations, under our Senior ABL Facility, depends on our future operating performance and cash flow and many factors outside of our control, including the costs of raw materials, the state of the overall automotive industry and financial and economic conditions and other factors.\nCash Flows\nOperating activities.
