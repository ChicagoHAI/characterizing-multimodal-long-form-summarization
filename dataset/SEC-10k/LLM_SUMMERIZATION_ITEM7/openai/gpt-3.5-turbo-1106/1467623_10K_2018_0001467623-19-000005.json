MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur modern economy runs on knowledge. Today, knowledge lives in the cloud as digital content, and Dropbox is a global collaboration platform where more and more of this content is created, accessed, and shared with the world. We serve more than 500 million registered users across 180 countries.\nSince our founding in 2007, our market opportunity has grown as we've expanded from keeping files in sync to keeping teams in sync. We believe the need for our platform will continue to grow as teams become more fluid and global, and content is increasingly fragmented across incompatible tools and devices. Dropbox breaks down silos by centralizing the flow of information between the products and services our users prefer, even if they're not our own.\nBy solving these universal problems, we've become invaluable to our users. The popularity of our platform drives viral growth, which has allowed us to scale rapidly and efficiently. We've built a thriving global business with 12.7 million paying users.\nOur Subscription Plans\nWe generate revenue from individuals, teams, and organizations by selling subscriptions to our platform, which serve the varying needs of our diverse customer base. Subscribers can purchase individual licenses through our Plus and Professional plans, or purchase multiple licenses through a Standard, Advanced, or Enterprise team plan. Each team represents a separately billed deployment that is managed through a single administrative dashboard. Teams must have a minimum of three users, but can also have more than tens of thousands of users. Customers can choose between an annual or monthly plan, with a small number of large organizations on multi-year plans. A majority of our customers opt for our annual plans. We typically bill our customers at the beginning of their respective terms and recognize revenue ratably over the term of the subscription period. International customers can pay in U.S. dollars or a select number of foreign currencies.\nOur premium subscription plans, such as Professional and Advanced, provide more functionality than other subscription plans and have higher per user prices. Our Standard and Advanced subscription plans offer robust capabilities for businesses, and the vast majority of Dropbox Business teams purchase our Standard or Advanced subscription plans. While our Enterprise subscription plan offers more opportunities for customization, companies can subscribe to any of these team plans for their business needs.\nOur Customers\nOur customer base is highly diversified, and in the period presented, no customer accounted for more than 1% of our revenue. Our customers include individuals, teams, and organizations of all sizes, from freelancers and small businesses to Fortune 100 companies. They work across a wide range of industries, including professional services, technology, media, education, industrials, consumer and retail, and financial services. Within companies, our platform is used by all types of teams and functions, including sales, marketing, product, design, engineering, finance, legal, and human resources.\nOur Business Model\nDrive new signups\nWe acquire users efficiently and at relatively low costs through word-of-mouth referrals, direct in-product referrals, and sharing of content. Anyone can create a Dropbox account for free through our website or app and be up and running in minutes. These users often share and collaborate with other non-registered users, attracting new signups into our network.\nIncrease conversion of registered users to our paid subscription plans\nWe generate over 90% of our revenue from self-serve channels-users who purchase a subscription through our app or website. We actively encourage our registered users to become paying users through in-product prompts and notifications, time-limited free trials of paid subscription plans, email campaigns, and lifecycle marketing.\nUpgrade and expand existing customers\nWe offer a range of paid subscription plans, from Plus and Professional for individuals to Standard, Advanced, and Enterprise for teams. We analyze usage patterns within our network and run hundreds of targeted marketing campaigns to encourage paying users to upgrade their plans. We prompt individual subscribers who collaborate with others on Dropbox to purchase our Standard or Advanced plans for a better team experience, and we also encourage existing Dropbox Business teams to purchase additional licenses or to upgrade to premium subscription plans.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe review a number of operating and financial metrics, including the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\nPaying users\nWe define paying users as the number of users who have active paid licenses for access to our platform as of the end of the period. One person would count as multiple paying users if the person had more than one active license. For example, a 50-person Dropbox Business team would count as 50 paying users, and an individual Dropbox Plus user would count as one paying user. If that individual Dropbox Plus user was also part of the 50-person Dropbox Business team, we would count the individual as two paying users. As of December 31, 2018, across all of our paying users, more than 30% subscribe to a Dropbox team plan while the remainder are on a Dropbox individual plan.\nWe have experienced growth in the number of paying users across our products, with the majority of paying users for the periods presented coming from our self-serve channels.\nThe below table sets forth the number of paying users as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Paying users\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage revenue per paying user\nWe define average revenue per paying user, or ARPU, as our revenue for the period presented divided by the average paying users during the same period. For interim periods, we use annualized revenue, which is calculated by dividing the revenue for the particular period by the number of days in that period and multiplying this value by 365 days. Average paying users are calculated based on adding the number of paying users as of the beginning of the period to the number of paying users as of the end of the period, and then dividing by two.\nIn 2017, we launched our Dropbox Business Advanced plan. At the time of launch, we grandfathered existing Dropbox Business teams into the Dropbox Business Advanced plan at their legacy price. During the second quarter of 2018, a significant portion of those grandfathered teams renewed at a higher price. As a result of these renewals, and combined with an increased\nmix of sales towards our higher-priced subscription plans, we experienced an increase in our average revenue per paying user for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOur ARPU increased for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increased mix of sales towards our higher priced subscription plans, including our Dropbox Business Advanced plan launched in early 2017.\nThe below table sets forth our ARPU for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ARPU\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we believe that free cash flow, or FCF, a non-GAAP financial measure, is useful in evaluating our liquidity.\nFree cash flow\nWe define FCF as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe that FCF is a liquidity measure and that it provides useful information regarding cash provided by operating activities and cash used for investments in property and equipment required to maintain and grow our business. FCF is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. Some of the limitations of FCF are that FCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments, excludes investments made to acquire assets under capital leases, and may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nOur FCF increased for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher cash provided by operating activities, which was driven by increased subscription sales, as a majority of our paying users are invoiced in advance. These cash inflows were partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures primarily related to the build-out of our new corporate headquarters.\nOur FCF increased for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to higher cash provided by operating activities, which was driven by increased subscription sales, as a majority of our paying users are invoiced in advance. In addition, FCF increased due to a decrease in capital expenditures related to our office and datacenter build-outs.\nWe expect our FCF to fluctuate in future periods as we purchase infrastructure equipment to support our user base and invest in our new and existing office spaces, including our new corporate headquarters, to support our plans for growth. These activities, along with certain increased operating expenses as described below, may result in a decrease in FCF as a percentage of revenue in future periods.\nThe following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities:\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>425.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>330.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>252.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>(63.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(115.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>362.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>305.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform.\nRevenue is recognized ratably over the related contractual term generally beginning on the date that our platform is made available to a customer. Our subscription agreements typically have monthly or annual contractual terms, although a small percentage have multi-year contractual terms. Our agreements are generally non-cancelable. We typically bill in advance for monthly contracts and annually in advance for contracts with terms of one year or longer. Amounts that have been billed are initially recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue is recognized.\nOur revenue is driven primarily by the number of paying users and the price we charge for access to our platform, which varies based on the type of plan to which a customer subscribes. We generate over 90% of our revenue from self-serve channels. No customer represented more than 1% of our revenue in the periods presented.\nCost of revenue and gross margin\nCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the storage, delivery, and distribution of our platform for both paying users and free users, also known as Basic users. These costs, which we refer to as infrastructure costs, include depreciation of our servers located in co-location facilities that we lease and operate, rent and facilities expense for those datacenters, network and bandwidth costs, support and maintenance costs for our infrastructure equipment, and payments to third-party datacenter service providers. Cost of revenue also includes costs, such as salaries, bonuses, employer payroll taxes and benefits, travel-related expenses, and stock-based compensation, which we refer to as employee-related costs, for employees whose primary responsibilities relate to supporting our infrastructure and delivering user support. Other non-employee costs included in cost of revenue include credit card fees related to processing customer transactions, and allocated overhead, such as facilities, including rent, utilities, depreciation on leasehold improvements and other equipment shared by all departments, and shared information technology costs. In addition, cost of revenue includes amortization of developed technologies, professional fees related to user support initiatives, and property taxes related to the datacenters.\nIn recent years, we have taken several steps to improve the efficiency of the infrastructure that supports our platform. These efforts include an initiative that focused on migrating the vast majority of user data stored on the infrastructure of third-party service providers to our own lower cost, custom-built infrastructure in co-location facilities that we directly lease and operate. In order to host user data on our own infrastructure, we leased or purchased infrastructure that is depreciated within our cost of revenue. During the migration to our internal infrastructure, we duplicated our users' data between our internal infrastructure and that of our third-party service providers, resulting in higher storage costs. We reduced this practice over time until we completed the migration in the fourth quarter of 2016. Related to this initiative, we no longer duplicate data between our internal infrastructure and that of any third-party service providers. We expect to continue to realize benefits from expanding our internal infrastructure due to our operating scale and lower unit costs.\nStarting in 2016, we also took measures to manage the storage footprint of certain long-inactive Basic users, freeing up additional storage capacity. Specifically, we closed the accounts of certain Basic users who had not engaged in any activity on the Dropbox platform in the last year and did not respond to multiple e-mail inquiries from us regarding their inactivity. We continue to regularly take similar measures to manage long-inactive and non-responsive Basic user accounts, and our total registered user numbers do not include accounts that have been closed. This effort, along with additional usage optimizations in 2017, enabled us to continue operating our business within our existing infrastructure base without a need for extensive incremental capital expenditures and leasing activity.\nThese efforts are collectively referred to as our Infrastructure Optimization, and some are ongoing.\nOur Infrastructure Optimization reduced unit costs and helped limit capital expenditures and associated depreciation. Combined with the concurrent increase in our base of paying users, we experienced a reduction in our cost of revenue, an increase in our gross margins, and an improvement in our free cash flow in the periods presented.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, based on considerations including our asset replacement cycle and our ongoing Infrastructure Optimization efforts, we revisited the useful life estimates of certain infrastructure equipment. These optimization efforts include efficiencies that allow us to utilize certain infrastructure equipment for longer periods of time. As a result, we determined that the useful lives of the impacted infrastructure equipment, which are depreciated through cost of revenue, should be increased from three to four years. We accounted for this as a change in estimate that was applied prospectively, effective as of January 1, 2018. This change in useful life resulted in a reduction in depreciation expense within cost of revenue of $16.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe plan to continue increasing the capacity and enhancing the capability and reliability of our infrastructure to support user growth and increased use of our platform. We expect that cost of revenue, excluding the impact of certain stock-based compensation charges described in -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d, will increase in absolute dollars in\nfuture periods. In addition, as a result of certain stock-based compensation charges described in -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d, our cost of revenue increased significantly in absolute dollars during the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the completion of our initial public offering.\nGross margin. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of additional capital expenditures and the related depreciation expense, or other increases in our infrastructure costs, as well as revenue fluctuations. As we continue to increase the utilization of our internal infrastructure, we generally expect our gross margin, excluding the impact of certain stock-based compensation charges described in -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d, to remain relatively constant in the near term and to increase modestly in the long term.\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for our engineering, product, and design teams, and allocated overhead. Additionally, research and development expenses include internal development-related third-party hosting fees. We have expensed almost all of our research and development costs as they were incurred.\nWe plan to continue to hire employees for our engineering, product, and design teams to support our research and development efforts. We expect that research and development costs will increase in absolute dollars in future periods and, excluding the impact of certain stock-based compensation charges described in -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d, vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue.\nSales and marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses relate to both self-serve and outbound sales activities, and consist primarily of employee-related costs, brand marketing costs, lead generation costs, sponsorships and allocated overhead. Sales commissions earned by our outbound sales team and the related payroll taxes, as well as commissions earned by third-party resellers that we consider to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a user, are deferred and amortized over an estimated period of benefit of five years. Additionally, sales and marketing expenses include non-employee costs related to app store fees and fees payable to third-party sales representatives.\nWe plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our user base and increase our brand awareness, including marketing efforts to continue to drive our self-serve business model. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods and, excluding the impact of certain stock-based compensation charges described in -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d, vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue. The trend and timing of sales and marketing expenses will depend in part on the timing of marketing campaigns.\nGeneral and administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for our legal, finance, human resources, and other administrative teams, as well as certain executives. In addition, general and administrative expenses include allocated overhead, outside legal, accounting and other professional fees, non-income based taxes, and contributions to the Dropbox Charitable Foundation.\nWe expect to incur additional general and administrative expenses to support the growth of the Company as well as our transition to being a publicly traded company, which includes the recognition of stock-based compensation expense related to grants of restricted stock made to our co-founders. We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods and, excluding the impact of certain stock-based compensation charges described in -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d, vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue.\nAs a result of certain stock-based compensation charges described in -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d, our research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses increased significantly in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the completion of our initial public offering.\nInterest income (expense), net\nInterest income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income earned from our money market funds classified as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, partially offset by interest expense related to our capital lease obligations for infrastructure and our imputed financing obligation for our liability to the legal owner of our previous corporate headquarters. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018, we no longer incur interest expense for our imputed financing obligation due to the termination of our master lease for our previous corporate headquarters in the third quarter of 2018.\nOther income, net\nOther income, net consists of other non-operating gains or losses, including those related to lease arrangements, which include ongoing subleases. Sublease income in excess of our original lease obligation is split with the original lessor per the terms of the sublease agreement, with our portion recorded to other income, net. Other income, net also includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and realized gains and losses related to our short-term investments.\nProvision for income taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of U.S. federal and state income taxes and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. For the periods presented, the difference between the U.S. statutory rate and our effective tax rate is primarily due to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rate is also impacted by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the federal statutory tax rate. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets for federal, state, and certain foreign jurisdictions as we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that the deferred assets will be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $923.6 million of federal and $403.5 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. Of our federal net operating loss carryforwards, $307.4 million will begin to expire in 2031 and $616.2 million will carryforward indefinitely, while state net operating losses begin to expire in 2029. As of December 31, 2018, we also had $265.1 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, which will carryforward indefinitely. In addition, we had $22.9 million of foreign acquired net operating losses, which will carryforward indefinitely. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in time to use these net operating loss carryforwards before their expiration. In addition, under Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change,\u201d the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an ownership change\u201d will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by 5-percent shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We performed a study for the period through December 31, 2018, and determined that no ownership changes exceeding 50 percentage points have occurred. Our ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future taxable income and liabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of ownership changes from January 1, 2019, and subsequent years.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Reform Act, was enacted on December 22, 2017 and provides for significant changes to U.S. tax law. Among other provisions, the Tax Reform Act reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% effective in 2018. The Tax Reform Act also contains a number of provisions that may impact us in future years. At December 31, 2017, we had not completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act for remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, one-time transition tax, and tax on global intangible low-taxed income. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. Upon completing our analysis, we have recognized no material adjustments to our provisional amounts recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe continue to monitor ongoing guidance in this area, as the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Reform Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation.\nAs a result of the reduction in the corporate rate, we remeasured our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the lower rate expected to apply when these temporary differences reverse. As of December 31, 2017, we determined the remeasurement resulted in a reduction in deferred tax assets of $63.1 million, which was fully offset by a corresponding change to our valuation allowance. There were no material changes from provisional amounts recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Tax Reform Act repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax, or AMT, effective beginning in 2018 and permits AMT credit carryforwards to be refunded to the extent unused through 2021. Since we do not anticipate the use of these credits to reduce future federal taxes, we recognized an income tax benefit and established an income tax receivable to reflect anticipated refunds of $1.4 million for our 2016 AMT credit carryforward during the year ended December 31, 2018. There were no material changes from provisional amounts recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Tax Reform Act also provides for a transition to a new territorial system of taxation and generally requires companies to include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries into taxable income in 2017, or the Transition Tax. As a result of the cumulative deficits in our foreign subsidiaries, we have no Transition Tax inclusion.\nThe Tax Reform Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740 No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred. We\nhave elected to recognize the tax on GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred. As a result of the tested losses in our foreign subsidiaries under GILTI regulations, we have no GILTI inclusion for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods:\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,391.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,106.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>844.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue(1)\n</td> <td>394.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>368.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>390.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>997.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>737.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>454.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>768.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>380.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>289.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>439.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>314.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>283.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>1,491.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>851.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>647.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>(494.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(113.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(193.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income (expense), net\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>(480.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(111.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(205.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>(4.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(484.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(111.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(210.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes stock-based compensation as follows:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>368.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>94.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>140.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total stock-based compensation(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>650.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>164.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized the cumulative unrecognized stock-based compensation of $418.7 million related to our two-tier restricted stock units upon the effectiveness of our registration statement for our IPO.

Cost of revenue also increased due to $10.1 million in credit card transaction fees due to higher sales and professional fees for user support, and $4.3 million in overhead-related costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $23.3 million in our infrastructure costs primarily due to continued infrastructure usage optimization\nefforts, which included a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in depreciable useful life of certain of our infrastructure equipment, which was effective on January 1, 2018.\nOur gross margin increased from 67% during the year ended December 31, 2017 to 72% during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a 26% increase in our revenue during the period and a decrease in our infrastructure costs as described above.

Seasonality in our revenue is not material.\nQuarterly cost of revenue and gross margin trends\nExcept for the three months ended March 31, 2018, our cost of revenue fluctuated in each of the quarters presented primarily due to the timing of our Infrastructure Optimization efforts, which combined with increases in our revenue caused our gross margins to increase or remain constant. In addition, our cost of revenue increased significantly, in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue, during the three months ended March 31, 2018, due to the completion of our initial public offering, as further described in \"-Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\".\nQuarterly operating expense trends\nExcept for the three months ended March 31, 2018, our total quarterly operating expenses increased sequentially in the quarters presented primarily due to headcount growth in connection with the expansion of our business and other events that are discussed herein. In addition, our quarterly operating expenses increased significantly, in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue, during the three months ended March 31, 2018, due to the completion of our initial public offering, as further described in \"-Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\".\nResearch and development\nOur research and development expenses increased at a faster rate during the three months ended March 31, 2018, comparatively to other quarters, primarily due to the completion of our initial public offering, as further described in \"-Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\".\nSales and marketing\nOur sales and marketing expenses fluctuated in the quarters presented primarily due to employee-related expenses and brand advertising campaigns. The timing of brand advertising campaigns can impact the trends in sales and marketing expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses increased at a faster rate during the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to the completion of our initial public offering, as further described in \"-Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\".\nGeneral and administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses fluctuated in the quarters presented, primarily due to increases in employee-related expenses and legal, accounting, and other professional fees. Our general and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2017 included expense of $9.4 million for a non-cash charitable donation of shares of our common stock as initial funding for the Dropbox Charitable Foundation. Additionally, as a result of our initial public offering, and in the same quarter, we began recognizing stock-based compensation expense related to market-based awards granted to our co-founders in 2017 (\"Co-Founder Grants\"), as further described in \"-Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\".\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $519.3 million and short-term investments of $570.0 million, which were held for working capital purposes. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments consist primarily of cash, money market funds, corporate notes and obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, commercial paper, and certificates of deposits. As of December 31, 2018, we had $133.8 million of our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries. We do not expect to incur material taxes in the event we repatriate any of these amounts.\nOn March 27, 2018, upon the completion of our IPO and concurrent private placement, we received aggregate proceeds of $638.2 million, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions. On March 28, 2018, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 5,400,000 shares of our Class A common stock. This transaction closed on April 3, 2018, resulting in additional proceeds of $108.4 million, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions. Our net proceeds from the IPO, the concurrent private placement, and underwriters' option totaled $746.6 million, before deducting offering costs of $6.9 million, net of reimbursements.\nSince our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through equity issuances, cash generated from our operations, and capital leases to finance infrastructure-related assets in co-location facilities that we directly lease and operate. We enter into capital leases in part to better match the timing of payments for infrastructure-related assets with that of cash received from our paying users. In our business model, some of our registered users convert to paying users over time, and consequently there is a lag between initial investment in infrastructure assets and cash received from some of our users.\nOur principal uses of cash in recent periods have been funding our operations, purchases of short-term investments, the satisfaction of tax withholdings in connection with the settlement of restricted stock units, making principal payments on our capital lease obligations, and capital expenditures.\nIn April 2017, we entered into a $600.0 million credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions. Pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit facility, we may issue letters of credit under the revolving credit facility, which reduce the total amount available for borrowing under such facility. The revolving credit facility terminates on April 4, 2022. In February 2018, we amended our revolving credit facility to, among other things, permit us to make certain investments, enter into an unsecured standby letter of credit facility, and increase our standby letter of credit sublimit to $187.5 million. We also increased our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility from $600.0 million to $725.0 million. We may from time to time request increases in the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of up to $275.0 million, provided no event of default has occurred or is continuing or would result from such increase.\nInterest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility accrues at a variable rate tied to the prime rate or the LIBOR rate, at our election. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. Pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit facility, we are required to pay an annual commitment fee that accrues at a rate of 0.20% per annum on the unused portion of the borrowing commitments under the revolving credit facility. In addition, we are required to pay a fee in connection with letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility that accrues at a rate of 1.5% per annum on the amount of such letters of credit\noutstanding. There is an additional fronting fee of 0.125% per annum multiplied by the average aggregate daily maximum amount available under all letters of credit.\nThe revolving credit facility contains customary conditions to borrowing, events of default, and covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make distributions to our holders or our subsidiaries' equity interests, make investments, or engage in transactions with our affiliates. In addition, the revolving credit facility contains financial covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant and a minimum liquidity balance. We were in compliance with all covenants under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and an aggregate of $68.5 million in letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Our total available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility was $656.5 million as of December 31, 2018.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with our short-term investments, cash provided by operations and amounts available under the revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our revenue growth rate, subscription renewal activity, billing frequency, the timing and extent of spending to support further infrastructure development and research and development efforts, the timing and extent of additional capital expenditures to invest in existing and new office spaces, such as our new corporate headquarters, the satisfaction of tax withholding obligations for the release of restricted stock units, the expansion of sales and marketing and international operation activities, the introduction of new product capabilities and enhancement of our platform, and the continuing market acceptance of our platform. We have and may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur cash flow activities were as follows for the periods presented:\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>425.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>330.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>252.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(633.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(118.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>300.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(231.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(134.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities\nOur largest source of operating cash is cash collections from our paying users for subscriptions to our platform. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, infrastructure-related costs, and marketing expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by our net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization expenses and stock-based compensation, as well as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $425.4 million, which mostly consisted of our net loss of $484.9 million, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense of $650.1 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $166.8 million, and net cash inflow of $83.2 million from operating assets and liabilities. The inflow from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase of $66.4 million in deferred revenue from increased subscription sales, as a majority of our paying users are invoiced in advance. Additionally, cash provided by operating activities increased due to an increase in other operating assets and liabilities of $16.8 million. Our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 also included a payment of $13.8 million of employer payroll taxes related to the release of our two-tier RSUs in connection with our IPO, which was paid in the first quarter of 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $330.3 million, which mostly consisted of our net loss of $111.7 million, adjusted for depreciation and amortization expenses of $181.8 million and stock-based compensation expense of $164.6 million, and net cash inflow of $81.3 million from operating assets and liabilities. The\ninflow from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase of $64.3 million in deferred revenue from increased subscription sales, as a majority of our paying users are invoiced in advance. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to a reduction of our net loss, as adjusted for stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as cash inflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $252.6 million, which primarily consisted of our net loss of $210.2 million, adjusted for depreciation and amortization expenses of $191.6 million and stock-based compensation expense of $147.6 million, as well as a net cash inflow of $118.8 million from operating assets and liabilities. The inflow from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase of $87.6 million in deferred revenue from increased subscription sales, as a majority of our paying users are invoiced in advance, and an increase of $35.6 million in accrued compensation and benefits due to the introduction of our annual bonus plan.\nInvesting activities\nNet cash used in investing activities is primarily impacted by purchases of short-term investments, purchases of property and equipment to make improvements to existing and new office spaces, and for purchasing infrastructure equipment in co-location facilities that we directly lease and operate.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $633.8 million, which primarily related to purchases of short-term investments of $850.4 million and capital expenditures of $63.0 million related to our office and datacenter build-outs. These outflows were partially offset by inflows of $283.6 million related to proceeds from maturities and sales of short-term investments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $23.9 million, which mostly consisted of capital expenditures related to our infrastructure equipment and office build-outs. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to decreases in capital expenditures for infrastructure equipment and leasehold improvements related to our current corporate headquarters.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $118.0 million, which mostly consisted of capital expenditures related to our infrastructure and office build-outs.\nFinancing activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities is primarily impacted by the completion of our IPO, repurchases of common stock to satisfy the tax withholding obligation for the release of RSUs and capital lease obligations for our infrastructure equipment. In 2017, we began releasing shares of common stock underlying vested one-tier RSUs, which generally have a service-based vesting condition over a four-year period and resulted in cash outflows to satisfy the employee tax withholding obligation for those employees who elected to net share settle their awards. See -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d for additional information.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $300.8 million, which primarily consisted of $746.6 million in net proceeds from the completion of our IPO and concurrent private placement. The proceeds were offset by $351.9 million for the satisfaction of tax withholding obligations for the release of restricted stock units and $109.1 million in principal payments against capital lease obligations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $231.7 million, which primarily consisted of $133.0 million in principal payments against capital lease obligations and $87.9 million for the satisfaction of tax withholding obligations for the release of restricted stock units. The increase in cash used by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to the increase of $87.9 million related to the satisfaction of tax withholding obligations for the release of restricted stock units.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $134.5 million, which primarily consisted of $137.9 million in principal payments against capital lease obligations and $3.8 million in principal payments against a note payable issued in 2015, offset by $8.8 million in proceeds received for a sale-leaseback agreement.\nContractual Obligations\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases for office space and datacenter operations, and capital leases for datacenter equipment.

As a result of the amendment, we expect to vacate our current corporate headquarters in August 2019, but are obligated to pay rent through February 2020. Accordingly, our future operating lease commitments were reduced by $192.4 million. The lease amendment did not have a material impact to our consolidated statement of operations in the year ended December 31, 2018, nor do we expect it to be material through our lease termination date in 2019. See Note 10, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nIn 2017, we entered into a new lease agreement for office space in San Francisco, California, to serve as our new corporate headquarters. We took initial possession of our new corporate headquarters in June 2018 and began to recognize rent expense in the same period.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nSignificant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\nRestricted Stock Units\nWe have granted restricted stock units, or RSUs, to our employees and members of our Board of Directors under our 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2008 Plan, our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2017 Plan and our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2018 Plan.

The Performance Vesting Condition was satisfied upon the effectiveness of the registration statement related to our IPO. Our last grant date for two-tier RSUs was May 2015. We recognize compensation expense associated with two-tier RSUs using the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period.\nUpon the effectiveness of the registration statement related to our IPO, we recognized stock-based compensation related to our two-tier RSUs using the accelerated attribution method, with a cumulative catch-up in the amount of $418.7 million attributable to service provided prior to such effective date. As of December 31, 2018, the unamortized stock-based compensation related to our two-tier RSUs was $0.1 million, which will be recognized if the requisite service is provided over a remaining weighted average period of 0.2 years.\nCo-Founder Grants\nIn December 2017, the Board of Directors approved a grant to our co-founders of restricted stock awards, or RSAs, with respect to 14.7 million shares of Class A Common Stock in the aggregate, or collectively, the Co-Founder Grants, of which 10.3 million RSAs were granted to Mr. Houston, the Company's co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, and 4.4 million RSAs were granted to Mr. Ferdowsi, the Company's co-founder and Director. These Co-Founder Grants have service-based, market-based, and performance-based vesting conditions. While the Co-Founder Grants have certain stockholder rights prior to their vesting, such as the right to vote the shares with the other holders of our Class A common stock, the Co-Founder Grants will be excluded from Class A common stock issued and outstanding until the satisfaction of these vesting conditions.\nThe Co-Founder Grants are eligible to vest over the ten-year period following the date the Company's shares of Class A common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in connection with our IPO, which occurred on March 23, 2018. The Co-Founder Grants comprise nine tranches that are eligible to vest based on the achievement of stock price goals (each, a \"Stock Price Target\"), measured over a consecutive thirty-day trading period during the Performance Period, which will begin on January 1, 2019, as follows:\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company Stock Price\nTarget\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Shares Eligible to Vest for\nMr. Houston\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Shares Eligible to Vest\nfor Mr. Ferdowsi\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$30.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,066,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>880,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$37.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,033,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>440,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$45.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,033,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>440,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$52.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,033,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>440,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$60.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,033,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>440,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$67.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,033,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>440,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$75.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,033,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>440,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$82.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,033,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>440,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$90.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,033,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>440,000\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the first four years of the Performance Period, no more than 20% of the shares subject to each Co-Founder Grant would be eligible to vest in any calendar year. After the first four years, all shares are eligible to vest based on the achievement of the Company Stock Price Targets. The Co-Founder Grants contain an implied performance-based vesting condition that was satisfied on the date of our IPO.\nWe estimated the grant date fair value of the Co-Founder Grants using a model based on multiple stock price paths developed through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation that incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the Stock Price Targets may not be satisfied. The average grant date fair value of each Co-Founder Grant was estimated to be $10.60 per share, and we will recognize total stock-based compensation expense of $156.2 million over the requisite service period of each tranche, which ranged from 2.9 to 6.9 years, using the accelerated attribution method. If the Stock Price Targets are met sooner than the derived service period, we will adjust our stock-based compensation to reflect the cumulative expense associated with the vested awards. We will recognize stock-based compensation expense if the requisite service period is provided, regardless of whether the market conditions are achieved.\nThe performance vesting condition for the Co-Founder Grants was satisfied on the date that our shares of Class A common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in connection with our IPO. We recognized the cumulative\nunrecognized expense of our Co-Founder Grants of $10.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, using the accelerated attribution method, which increased our general and administrative expenses.\nAward Modifications\nDuring the year ended the year ended December 31, 2017, our Board of Directors voted to approve a modification of vesting schedules for certain unvested one-tier and two-tier RSUs to align the vesting schedules for all RSUs to vest once per quarter. The modification was effective February 15, 2018, which resulted in accelerated vesting of impacted RSUs that had met their service requirement as of that date. As a result, we recognized an incremental $10.0 million in stock-based compensation during the first quarter of 2018, which is included in the results for the year ended December 31, 2018, related to these modified RSUs. We do not expect to record incremental stock-based compensation related to this modification in future periods.\nSee Note 1, Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 11, Stockholders' Equity\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our equity awards.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Judgments\nOur consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in the United States. The preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected.\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue recognition\nWe generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform. Subscription fees exclude sales and other indirect taxes. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Determination of the transaction price\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our subscription agreements typically have monthly or annual contractual terms, and a small percentage have multi-year contractual terms. Revenue is recognized ratably over the related contractual term generally beginning on the date that our platform is made available to a customer. Our agreements are generally non-cancelable. We typically bill in advance for monthly contracts and annually in advance for contracts with terms of one year or longer.\nDeferred commissions\nCertain sales commissions and the related payroll taxes earned by our outbound sales team, as well as commissions earned by third-party resellers, are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. These costs are deferred and then amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our historical customer attrition rates, the useful life of our technology, and the impact of competition in our industry.\nCommon stock valuations\nSince August 2015, we have granted RSUs as the only stock-based payment awards to our employees, excluding the Co-Founder Grants. While we stopped granting stock options in August 2015, we currently have stock options outstanding that will continue to vest through 2019 if the requisite service is provided.\nThe fair values of the common stock underlying the RSUs prior to the date of our IPO were determined by our Board of Directors, with input from management and contemporaneous third-party valuations, which were performed at least quarterly. If RSUs were granted a short period of time prior to the date of a valuation report, we retrospectively assessed the fair value used for financial reporting purposes after considering the fair value reflected in the subsequent valuation report and other facts and circumstances on the date of grant as discussed below.\nGiven the absence of a public trading market for our common stock prior to our IPO, and in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or AICPA Guide, our Board of Directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock including:\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The results of contemporaneous valuations of our common stock by unrelated third parties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The rights, preferences, and privileges of our convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Market multiples of comparable public companies in our industry as indicated by their market capitalization and guideline merger and acquisition transactions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our performance and market position relative to our competitors, who may change from time to time;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our historical financial results and estimated trends and prospects for our future performance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Valuations published by institutional investors that hold investments in our capital stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The economic and competitive environment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The likelihood and timeline of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale, given prevailing market conditions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Any adjustments necessary to recognize a lack of marketability for our common stock; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Precedent sales of or offers to purchase our capital stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In valuing our common stock, our Board of Directors determined the fair value of our common stock using both the income and market approach valuation methods. The income approach estimates value based on the expectation of future cash flows that a company will generate. These future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital, and is adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in our cash flows. The market approach estimates value based on a comparison of the subject company to comparable public companies in a similar line of business. From the comparable companies, a representative market value multiple is determined and then applied to the subject company's financial forecasts to estimate the value of the subject company.\nFor valuations prior to August 31, 2017, the equity valuation was based on both the income and the market approach valuation methods, in addition to giving consideration to recent secondary sales of our common stock. The Option Pricing Method was selected as the principal equity allocation method. These methods were consistent with prior valuations.\nFor valuations as of and subsequent to August 31, 2017, we have used a hybrid method to determine the fair value of our common stock, in addition to giving consideration to recent secondary sales of our common stock. Under the hybrid method, multiple valuation approaches were used and then combined into a single probability weighted valuation. Our approach included the use of initial public offering scenarios, a scenario assuming continued operation as a private entity, and a scenario assuming an acquisition of the company.\nApplication of these approaches involves the use of estimates, judgment, and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses, and cash flows, discount rates, market multiples, the selection of comparable companies, and the probability of future events. Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions, or the relationships between those assumptions, impact our valuations as of each valuation date and may have a material impact on the valuation of common stock.\nFor valuations after our initial public offering, our Board of Directors determines the fair value of each share of underlying common stock based on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the date of the grant.\nFair value of market condition awards\nThe Co-Founder Grants contain market-based vesting conditions. The market-based vesting condition is considered when calculating the grant date fair value of these awards, which requires the use of various estimates and assumptions. The grant date fair value of the Co-Founder Grants was estimated using a model based on multiple stock price paths developed through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation that incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. A Monte Carlo simulation requires the use of various assumptions, including our underlying stock price, volatility, and the risk-free interest rate as of the valuation date, corresponding to the length of time remaining in the performance period, and expected dividend yield. A Monte Carlo simulation also calculates a derived service period for each of the nine vesting tranches, which is the measure of the expected time to achieve the market conditions. Expense associated with market-based awards is recognized over the requisite service period of each tranche using the accelerated attribution method, regardless of whether the market conditions are achieved.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "summary": "The report discusses Dropbox's financial condition and operations, highlighting its revenue generation from subscription sales.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur modern economy runs on knowledge. Today, knowledge lives in the cloud as digital content, and Dropbox is a global collaboration platform where more and more of this content is created, accessed, and shared with the world. We serve more than 500 million registered users across 180 countries.\nSince our founding in 2007, our market opportunity has grown as we've expanded from keeping files in sync to keeping teams in sync. We believe the need for our platform will continue to grow as teams become more fluid and global, and content is increasingly fragmented across incompatible tools and devices. Dropbox breaks down silos by centralizing the flow of information between the products and services our users prefer, even if they're not our own.\nBy solving these universal problems, we've become invaluable to our users. The popularity of our platform drives viral growth, which has allowed us to scale rapidly and efficiently. We've built a thriving global business with 12.7 million paying users.\nOur Subscription Plans\nWe generate revenue from individuals, teams, and organizations by selling subscriptions to our platform, which serve the varying needs of our diverse customer base. Subscribers can purchase individual licenses through our Plus and Professional plans, or purchase multiple licenses through a Standard, Advanced, or Enterprise team plan. Each team represents a separately billed deployment that is managed through a single administrative dashboard. Teams must have a minimum of three users, but can also have more than tens of thousands of users. Customers can choose between an annual or monthly plan, with a small number of large organizations on multi-year plans. A majority of our customers opt for our annual plans. We typically bill our customers at the beginning of their respective terms and recognize revenue ratably over the term of the subscription period. International customers can pay in U.S. dollars or a select number of foreign currencies.\nOur premium subscription plans, such as Professional and Advanced, provide more functionality than other subscription plans and have higher per user prices. Our Standard and Advanced subscription plans offer robust capabilities for businesses, and the vast majority of Dropbox Business teams purchase our Standard or Advanced subscription plans. While our Enterprise subscription plan offers more opportunities for customization, companies can subscribe to any of these team plans for their business needs.\nOur Customers\nOur customer base is highly diversified, and in the period presented, no customer accounted for more than 1% of our revenue. Our customers include individuals, teams, and organizations of all sizes, from freelancers and small businesses to Fortune 100 companies. They work across a wide range of industries, including professional services, technology, media, education, industrials, consumer and retail, and financial services. Within companies, our platform is used by all types of teams and functions, including sales, marketing, product, design, engineering, finance, legal, and human resources.\nOur Business Model\nDrive new signups\nWe acquire users efficiently and at relatively low costs through word-of-mouth referrals, direct in-product referrals, and sharing of content. Anyone can create a Dropbox account for free through our website or app and be up and running in minutes. These users often share and collaborate with other non-registered users, attracting new signups into our network.\nIncrease conversion of registered users to our paid subscription plans\nWe generate over 90% of our revenue from self-serve channels-users who purchase a subscription through our app or website. We actively encourage our registered users to become paying users through in-product prompts and notifications, time-limited free trials of paid subscription plans, email campaigns, and lifecycle marketing.\nUpgrade and expand existing customers\nWe offer a range of paid subscription plans, from Plus and Professional for individuals to Standard, Advanced, and Enterprise for teams. We analyze usage patterns within our network and run hundreds of targeted marketing campaigns to encourage paying users to upgrade their plans. We prompt individual subscribers who collaborate with others on Dropbox to purchase our Standard or Advanced plans for a better team experience, and we also encourage existing Dropbox Business teams to purchase additional licenses or to upgrade to premium subscription plans.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe review a number of operating and financial metrics, including the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\nPaying users\nWe define paying users as the number of users who have active paid licenses for access to our platform as of the end of the period. One person would count as multiple paying users if the person had more than one active license. For example, a 50-person Dropbox Business team would count as 50 paying users, and an individual Dropbox Plus user would count as one paying user. If that individual Dropbox Plus user was also part of the 50-person Dropbox Business team, we would count the individual as two paying users. As of December 31, 2018, across all of our paying users, more than 30% subscribe to a Dropbox team plan while the remainder are on a Dropbox individual plan.\nWe have experienced growth in the number of paying users across our products, with the majority of paying users for the periods presented coming from our self-serve channels.\nThe below table sets forth the number of paying users as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:\n\nAverage revenue per paying user\nWe define average revenue per paying user, or ARPU, as our revenue for the period presented divided by the average paying users during the same period. For interim periods, we use annualized revenue, which is calculated by dividing the revenue for the particular period by the number of days in that period and multiplying this value by 365 days. Average paying users are calculated based on adding the number of paying users as of the beginning of the period to the number of paying users as of the end of the period, and then dividing by two.\nIn 2017, we launched our Dropbox Business Advanced plan. At the time of launch, we grandfathered existing Dropbox Business teams into the Dropbox Business Advanced plan at their legacy price. During the second quarter of 2018, a significant portion of those grandfathered teams renewed at a higher price. As a result of these renewals, and combined with an increased\nmix of sales towards our higher-priced subscription plans, we experienced an increase in our average revenue per paying user for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOur ARPU increased for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increased mix of sales towards our higher priced subscription plans, including our Dropbox Business Advanced plan launched in early 2017.\nThe below table sets forth our ARPU for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we believe that free cash flow, or FCF, a non-GAAP financial measure, is useful in evaluating our liquidity.\nFree cash flow\nWe define FCF as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe that FCF is a liquidity measure and that it provides useful information regarding cash provided by operating activities and cash used for investments in property and equipment required to maintain and grow our business. FCF is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. Some of the limitations of FCF are that FCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments, excludes investments made to acquire assets under capital leases, and may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nOur FCF increased for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher cash provided by operating activities, which was driven by increased subscription sales, as a majority of our paying users are invoiced in advance. These cash inflows were partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures primarily related to the build-out of our new corporate headquarters.\nOur FCF increased for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to higher cash provided by operating activities, which was driven by increased subscription sales, as a majority of our paying users are invoiced in advance. In addition, FCF increased due to a decrease in capital expenditures related to our office and datacenter build-outs.\nWe expect our FCF to fluctuate in future periods as we purchase infrastructure equipment to support our user base and invest in our new and existing office spaces, including our new corporate headquarters, to support our plans for growth. These activities, along with certain increased operating expenses as described below, may result in a decrease in FCF as a percentage of revenue in future periods.\nThe following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities:\n\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform.\nRevenue is recognized ratably over the related contractual term generally beginning on the date that our platform is made available to a customer. Our subscription agreements typically have monthly or annual contractual terms, although a small percentage have multi-year contractual terms. Our agreements are generally non-cancelable. We typically bill in advance for monthly contracts and annually in advance for contracts with terms of one year or longer. Amounts that have been billed are initially recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue is recognized.\nOur revenue is driven primarily by the number of paying users and the price we charge for access to our platform, which varies based on the type of plan to which a customer subscribes. We generate over 90% of our revenue from self-serve channels. No customer represented more than 1% of our revenue in the periods presented.\nCost of revenue and gross margin\nCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the storage, delivery, and distribution of our platform for both paying users and free users, also known as Basic users. These costs, which we refer to as infrastructure costs, include depreciation of our servers located in co-location facilities that we lease and operate, rent and facilities expense for those datacenters, network and bandwidth costs, support and maintenance costs for our infrastructure equipment, and payments to third-party datacenter service providers. Cost of revenue also includes costs, such as salaries, bonuses, employer payroll taxes and benefits, travel-related expenses, and stock-based compensation, which we refer to as employee-related costs, for employees whose primary responsibilities relate to supporting our infrastructure and delivering user support. Other non-employee costs included in cost of revenue include credit card fees related to processing customer transactions, and allocated overhead, such as facilities, including rent, utilities, depreciation on leasehold improvements and other equipment shared by all departments, and shared information technology costs. In addition, cost of revenue includes amortization of developed technologies, professional fees related to user support initiatives, and property taxes related to the datacenters.\nIn recent years, we have taken several steps to improve the efficiency of the infrastructure that supports our platform. These efforts include an initiative that focused on migrating the vast majority of user data stored on the infrastructure of third-party service providers to our own lower cost, custom-built infrastructure in co-location facilities that we directly lease and operate. In order to host user data on our own infrastructure, we leased or purchased infrastructure that is depreciated within our cost of revenue. During the migration to our internal infrastructure, we duplicated our users' data between our internal infrastructure and that of our third-party service providers, resulting in higher storage costs. We reduced this practice over time until we completed the migration in the fourth quarter of 2016. Related to this initiative, we no longer duplicate data between our internal infrastructure and that of any third-party service providers. We expect to continue to realize benefits from expanding our internal infrastructure due to our operating scale and lower unit costs.\nStarting in 2016, we also took measures to manage the storage footprint of certain long-inactive Basic users, freeing up additional storage capacity. Specifically, we closed the accounts of certain Basic users who had not engaged in any activity on the Dropbox platform in the last year and did not respond to multiple e-mail inquiries from us regarding their inactivity. We continue to regularly take similar measures to manage long-inactive and non-responsive Basic user accounts, and our total registered user numbers do not include accounts that have been closed. This effort, along with additional usage optimizations in 2017, enabled us to continue operating our business within our existing infrastructure base without a need for extensive incremental capital expenditures and leasing activity.\nThese efforts are collectively referred to as our Infrastructure Optimization, and some are ongoing.\nOur Infrastructure Optimization reduced unit costs and helped limit capital expenditures and associated depreciation. Combined with the concurrent increase in our base of paying users, we experienced a reduction in our cost of revenue, an increase in our gross margins, and an improvement in our free cash flow in the periods presented.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, based on considerations including our asset replacement cycle and our ongoing Infrastructure Optimization efforts, we revisited the useful life estimates of certain infrastructure equipment. These optimization efforts include efficiencies that allow us to utilize certain infrastructure equipment for longer periods of time. As a result, we determined that the useful lives of the impacted infrastructure equipment, which are depreciated through cost of revenue, should be increased from three to four years. We accounted for this as a change in estimate that was applied prospectively, effective as of January 1, 2018. This change in useful life resulted in a reduction in depreciation expense within cost of revenue of $16.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe plan to continue increasing the capacity and enhancing the capability and reliability of our infrastructure to support user growth and increased use of our platform. We expect that cost of revenue, excluding the impact of certain stock-based compensation charges described in -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d, will increase in absolute dollars in\nfuture periods. In addition, as a result of certain stock-based compensation charges described in -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d, our cost of revenue increased significantly in absolute dollars during the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the completion of our initial public offering.\nGross margin. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of additional capital expenditures and the related depreciation expense, or other increases in our infrastructure costs, as well as revenue fluctuations. As we continue to increase the utilization of our internal infrastructure, we generally expect our gross margin, excluding the impact of certain stock-based compensation charges described in -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d, to remain relatively constant in the near term and to increase modestly in the long term.\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for our engineering, product, and design teams, and allocated overhead. Additionally, research and development expenses include internal development-related third-party hosting fees. We have expensed almost all of our research and development costs as they were incurred.\nWe plan to continue to hire employees for our engineering, product, and design teams to support our research and development efforts. We expect that research and development costs will increase in absolute dollars in future periods and, excluding the impact of certain stock-based compensation charges described in -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d, vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue.\nSales and marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses relate to both self-serve and outbound sales activities, and consist primarily of employee-related costs, brand marketing costs, lead generation costs, sponsorships and allocated overhead. Sales commissions earned by our outbound sales team and the related payroll taxes, as well as commissions earned by third-party resellers that we consider to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a user, are deferred and amortized over an estimated period of benefit of five years. Additionally, sales and marketing expenses include non-employee costs related to app store fees and fees payable to third-party sales representatives.\nWe plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our user base and increase our brand awareness, including marketing efforts to continue to drive our self-serve business model. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods and, excluding the impact of certain stock-based compensation charges described in -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d, vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue. The trend and timing of sales and marketing expenses will depend in part on the timing of marketing campaigns.\nGeneral and administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for our legal, finance, human resources, and other administrative teams, as well as certain executives. In addition, general and administrative expenses include allocated overhead, outside legal, accounting and other professional fees, non-income based taxes, and contributions to the Dropbox Charitable Foundation.\nWe expect to incur additional general and administrative expenses to support the growth of the Company as well as our transition to being a publicly traded company, which includes the recognition of stock-based compensation expense related to grants of restricted stock made to our co-founders. We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods and, excluding the impact of certain stock-based compensation charges described in -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d, vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue.\nAs a result of certain stock-based compensation charges described in -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d, our research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses increased significantly in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the completion of our initial public offering.\nInterest income (expense), net\nInterest income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income earned from our money market funds classified as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, partially offset by interest expense related to our capital lease obligations for infrastructure and our imputed financing obligation for our liability to the legal owner of our previous corporate headquarters. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018, we no longer incur interest expense for our imputed financing obligation due to the termination of our master lease for our previous corporate headquarters in the third quarter of 2018.\nOther income, net\nOther income, net consists of other non-operating gains or losses, including those related to lease arrangements, which include ongoing subleases. Sublease income in excess of our original lease obligation is split with the original lessor per the terms of the sublease agreement, with our portion recorded to other income, net. Other income, net also includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and realized gains and losses related to our short-term investments.\nProvision for income taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of U.S. federal and state income taxes and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. For the periods presented, the difference between the U.S. statutory rate and our effective tax rate is primarily due to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rate is also impacted by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the federal statutory tax rate. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets for federal, state, and certain foreign jurisdictions as we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that the deferred assets will be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $923.6 million of federal and $403.5 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. Of our federal net operating loss carryforwards, $307.4 million will begin to expire in 2031 and $616.2 million will carryforward indefinitely, while state net operating losses begin to expire in 2029. As of December 31, 2018, we also had $265.1 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, which will carryforward indefinitely. In addition, we had $22.9 million of foreign acquired net operating losses, which will carryforward indefinitely. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in time to use these net operating loss carryforwards before their expiration. In addition, under Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change,\u201d the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an ownership change\u201d will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by 5-percent shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We performed a study for the period through December 31, 2018, and determined that no ownership changes exceeding 50 percentage points have occurred. Our ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future taxable income and liabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of ownership changes from January 1, 2019, and subsequent years.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Reform Act, was enacted on December 22, 2017 and provides for significant changes to U.S. tax law. Among other provisions, the Tax Reform Act reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% effective in 2018. The Tax Reform Act also contains a number of provisions that may impact us in future years. At December 31, 2017, we had not completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act for remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, one-time transition tax, and tax on global intangible low-taxed income. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. Upon completing our analysis, we have recognized no material adjustments to our provisional amounts recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe continue to monitor ongoing guidance in this area, as the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Reform Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation.\nAs a result of the reduction in the corporate rate, we remeasured our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the lower rate expected to apply when these temporary differences reverse. As of December 31, 2017, we determined the remeasurement resulted in a reduction in deferred tax assets of $63.1 million, which was fully offset by a corresponding change to our valuation allowance. There were no material changes from provisional amounts recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Tax Reform Act repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax, or AMT, effective beginning in 2018 and permits AMT credit carryforwards to be refunded to the extent unused through 2021. Since we do not anticipate the use of these credits to reduce future federal taxes, we recognized an income tax benefit and established an income tax receivable to reflect anticipated refunds of $1.4 million for our 2016 AMT credit carryforward during the year ended December 31, 2018. There were no material changes from provisional amounts recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Tax Reform Act also provides for a transition to a new territorial system of taxation and generally requires companies to include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries into taxable income in 2017, or the Transition Tax. As a result of the cumulative deficits in our foreign subsidiaries, we have no Transition Tax inclusion.\nThe Tax Reform Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740 No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred. We\nhave elected to recognize the tax on GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred. As a result of the tested losses in our foreign subsidiaries under GILTI regulations, we have no GILTI inclusion for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods:\n\n (1) Includes stock-based compensation as follows: \n\n (2) During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized the cumulative unrecognized stock-based compensation of $418.7 million related to our two-tier restricted stock units upon the effectiveness of our registration statement for our IPO.

Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur modern economy runs on knowledge. Today, knowledge lives in the cloud as digital content, and Dropbox is a global collaboration platform where more and more of this content is created, accessed, and shared with the world. We serve more than 500 million registered users across 180 countries.\nSince our founding in 2007, our market opportunity has grown as we've expanded from keeping files in sync to keeping teams in sync.

As of December 31, 2018, across all of our paying users, more than 30% subscribe to a Dropbox team plan while the remainder are on a Dropbox individual plan.\nWe have experienced growth in the number of paying users across our products, with the majority of paying users for the periods presented coming from our self-serve channels.\nThe below table sets forth the number of paying users as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Paying users\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage revenue per paying user\nWe define average revenue per paying user, or ARPU, as our revenue for the period presented divided by the average paying users during the same period. For interim periods, we use annualized revenue, which is calculated by dividing the revenue for the particular period by the number of days in that period and multiplying this value by 365 days. Average paying users are calculated based on adding the number of paying users as of the beginning of the period to the number of paying users as of the end of the period, and then dividing by two.\nIn 2017, we launched our Dropbox Business Advanced plan.

Some of the limitations of FCF are that FCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments, excludes investments made to acquire assets under capital leases, and may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nOur FCF increased for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher cash provided by operating activities, which was driven by increased subscription sales, as a majority of our paying users are invoiced in advance. These cash inflows were partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures primarily related to the build-out of our new corporate headquarters.\nOur FCF increased for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to higher cash provided by operating activities, which was driven by increased subscription sales, as a majority of our paying users are invoiced in advance. In addition, FCF increased due to a decrease in capital expenditures related to our office and datacenter build-outs.\nWe expect our FCF to fluctuate in future periods as we purchase infrastructure equipment to support our user base and invest in our new and existing office spaces, including our new corporate headquarters, to support our plans for growth. These activities, along with certain increased operating expenses as described below, may result in a decrease in FCF as a percentage of revenue in future periods.\nThe following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities:\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>425.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>330.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>252.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>(63.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(115.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>362.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>305.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform.\nRevenue is recognized ratably over the related contractual term generally beginning on the date that our platform is made available to a customer. Our subscription agreements typically have monthly or annual contractual terms, although a small percentage have multi-year contractual terms. Our agreements are generally non-cancelable. We typically bill in advance for monthly contracts and annually in advance for contracts with terms of one year or longer. Amounts that have been billed are initially recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue is recognized.\nOur revenue is driven primarily by the number of paying users and the price we charge for access to our platform, which varies based on the type of plan to which a customer subscribes. We generate over 90% of our revenue from self-serve channels. No customer represented more than 1% of our revenue in the periods presented.\nCost of revenue and gross margin\nCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the storage, delivery, and distribution of our platform for both paying users and free users, also known as Basic users. These costs, which we refer to as infrastructure costs, include depreciation of our servers located in co-location facilities that we lease and operate, rent and facilities expense for those datacenters, network and bandwidth costs, support and maintenance costs for our infrastructure equipment, and payments to third-party datacenter service providers. Cost of revenue also includes costs, such as salaries, bonuses, employer payroll taxes and benefits, travel-related expenses, and stock-based compensation, which we refer to as employee-related costs, for employees whose primary responsibilities relate to supporting our infrastructure and delivering user support. Other non-employee costs included in cost of revenue include credit card fees related to processing customer transactions, and allocated overhead, such as facilities, including rent, utilities, depreciation on leasehold improvements and other equipment shared by all departments, and shared information technology costs. In addition, cost of revenue includes amortization of developed technologies, professional fees related to user support initiatives, and property taxes related to the datacenters.\nIn recent years, we have taken several steps to improve the efficiency of the infrastructure that supports our platform. These efforts include an initiative that focused on migrating the vast majority of user data stored on the infrastructure of third-party service providers to our own lower cost, custom-built infrastructure in co-location facilities that we directly lease and operate. In order to host user data on our own infrastructure, we leased or purchased infrastructure that is depreciated within our cost of revenue. During the migration to our internal infrastructure, we duplicated our users' data between our internal infrastructure and that of our third-party service providers, resulting in higher storage costs. We reduced this practice over time until we completed the migration in the fourth quarter of 2016. Related to this initiative, we no longer duplicate data between our internal infrastructure and that of any third-party service providers. We expect to continue to realize benefits from expanding our internal infrastructure due to our operating scale and lower unit costs.\nStarting in 2016, we also took measures to manage the storage footprint of certain long-inactive Basic users, freeing up additional storage capacity. Specifically, we closed the accounts of certain Basic users who had not engaged in any activity on the Dropbox platform in the last year and did not respond to multiple e-mail inquiries from us regarding their inactivity. We continue to regularly take similar measures to manage long-inactive and non-responsive Basic user accounts, and our total registered user numbers do not include accounts that have been closed. This effort, along with additional usage optimizations in 2017, enabled us to continue operating our business within our existing infrastructure base without a need for extensive incremental capital expenditures and leasing activity.\nThese efforts are collectively referred to as our Infrastructure Optimization, and some are ongoing.\nOur Infrastructure Optimization reduced unit costs and helped limit capital expenditures and associated depreciation. Combined with the concurrent increase in our base of paying users, we experienced a reduction in our cost of revenue, an increase in our gross margins, and an improvement in our free cash flow in the periods presented.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, based on considerations including our asset replacement cycle and our ongoing Infrastructure Optimization efforts, we revisited the useful life estimates of certain infrastructure equipment. These optimization efforts include efficiencies that allow us to utilize certain infrastructure equipment for longer periods of time. As a result, we determined that the useful lives of the impacted infrastructure equipment, which are depreciated through cost of revenue, should be increased from three to four years. We accounted for this as a change in estimate that was applied prospectively, effective as of January 1, 2018. This change in useful life resulted in a reduction in depreciation expense within cost of revenue of $16.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe plan to continue increasing the capacity and enhancing the capability and reliability of our infrastructure to support user growth and increased use of our platform. We expect that cost of revenue, excluding the impact of certain stock-based compensation charges described in -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d, will increase in absolute dollars in\nfuture periods. In addition, as a result of certain stock-based compensation charges described in -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d, our cost of revenue increased significantly in absolute dollars during the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the completion of our initial public offering.\nGross margin. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of additional capital expenditures and the related depreciation expense, or other increases in our infrastructure costs, as well as revenue fluctuations. As we continue to increase the utilization of our internal infrastructure, we generally expect our gross margin, excluding the impact of certain stock-based compensation charges described in -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d, to remain relatively constant in the near term and to increase modestly in the long term.\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for our engineering, product, and design teams, and allocated overhead. Additionally, research and development expenses include internal development-related third-party hosting fees. We have expensed almost all of our research and development costs as they were incurred.\nWe plan to continue to hire employees for our engineering, product, and design teams to support our research and development efforts. We expect that research and development costs will increase in absolute dollars in future periods and, excluding the impact of certain stock-based compensation charges described in -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d, vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue.\nSales and marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses relate to both self-serve and outbound sales activities, and consist primarily of employee-related costs, brand marketing costs, lead generation costs, sponsorships and allocated overhead. Sales commissions earned by our outbound sales team and the related payroll taxes, as well as commissions earned by third-party resellers that we consider to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a user, are deferred and amortized over an estimated period of benefit of five years. Additionally, sales and marketing expenses include non-employee costs related to app store fees and fees payable to third-party sales representatives.\nWe plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our user base and increase our brand awareness, including marketing efforts to continue to drive our self-serve business model. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods and, excluding the impact of certain stock-based compensation charges described in -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d, vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue. The trend and timing of sales and marketing expenses will depend in part on the timing of marketing campaigns.\nGeneral and administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for our legal, finance, human resources, and other administrative teams, as well as certain executives. In addition, general and administrative expenses include allocated overhead, outside legal, accounting and other professional fees, non-income based taxes, and contributions to the Dropbox Charitable Foundation.\nWe expect to incur additional general and administrative expenses to support the growth of the Company as well as our transition to being a publicly traded company, which includes the recognition of stock-based compensation expense related to grants of restricted stock made to our co-founders. We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods and, excluding the impact of certain stock-based compensation charges described in -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d, vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue.\nAs a result of certain stock-based compensation charges described in -Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation\u201d, our research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses increased significantly in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the completion of our initial public offering.\nInterest income (expense), net\nInterest income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income earned from our money market funds classified as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, partially offset by interest expense related to our capital lease obligations for infrastructure and our imputed financing obligation for our liability to the legal owner of our previous corporate headquarters. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018, we no longer incur interest expense for our imputed financing obligation due to the termination of our master lease for our previous corporate headquarters in the third quarter of 2018.\nOther income, net\nOther income, net consists of other non-operating gains or losses, including those related to lease arrangements, which include ongoing subleases. Sublease income in excess of our original lease obligation is split with the original lessor per the terms of the sublease agreement, with our portion recorded to other income, net. Other income, net also includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and realized gains and losses related to our short-term investments.\nProvision for income taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of U.S. federal and state income taxes and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. For the periods presented, the difference between the U.S. statutory rate and our effective tax rate is primarily due to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rate is also impacted by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the federal statutory tax rate. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets for federal, state, and certain foreign jurisdictions as we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that the deferred assets will be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $923.6 million of federal and $403.5 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. Of our federal net operating loss carryforwards, $307.4 million will begin to expire in 2031 and $616.2 million will carryforward indefinitely, while state net operating losses begin to expire in 2029. As of December 31, 2018, we also had $265.1 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, which will carryforward indefinitely. In addition, we had $22.9 million of foreign acquired net operating losses, which will carryforward indefinitely. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in time to use these net operating loss carryforwards before their expiration. In addition, under Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change,\u201d the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an ownership change\u201d will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by 5-percent shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We performed a study for the period through December 31, 2018, and determined that no ownership changes exceeding 50 percentage points have occurred. Our ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future taxable income and liabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of ownership changes from January 1, 2019, and subsequent years.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Reform Act, was enacted on December 22, 2017 and provides for significant changes to U.S. tax law. Among other provisions, the Tax Reform Act reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% effective in 2018. The Tax Reform Act also contains a number of provisions that may impact us in future years. At December 31, 2017, we had not completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act for remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, one-time transition tax, and tax on global intangible low-taxed income. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. Upon completing our analysis, we have recognized no material adjustments to our provisional amounts recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe continue to monitor ongoing guidance in this area, as the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Reform Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation.\nAs a result of the reduction in the corporate rate, we remeasured our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the lower rate expected to apply when these temporary differences reverse. As of December 31, 2017, we determined the remeasurement resulted in a reduction in deferred tax assets of $63.1 million, which was fully offset by a corresponding change to our valuation allowance. There were no material changes from provisional amounts recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Tax Reform Act repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax, or AMT, effective beginning in 2018 and permits AMT credit carryforwards to be refunded to the extent unused through 2021. Since we do not anticipate the use of these credits to reduce future federal taxes, we recognized an income tax benefit and established an income tax receivable to reflect anticipated refunds of $1.4 million for our 2016 AMT credit carryforward during the year ended December 31, 2018. There were no material changes from provisional amounts recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Tax Reform Act also provides for a transition to a new territorial system of taxation and generally requires companies to include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries into taxable income in 2017, or the Transition Tax. As a result of the cumulative deficits in our foreign subsidiaries, we have no Transition Tax inclusion.\nThe Tax Reform Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740 No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred. We\nhave elected to recognize the tax on GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred. As a result of the tested losses in our foreign subsidiaries under GILTI regulations, we have no GILTI inclusion for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods:\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,391.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,106.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>844.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue(1)\n</td> <td>394.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>368.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>390.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>997.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>737.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>454.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>768.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>380.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>289.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>439.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>314.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>283.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>1,491.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>851.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>647.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>(494.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(113.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(193.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income (expense), net\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>(480.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(111.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(205.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>(4.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(484.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(111.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(210.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes stock-based compensation as follows: \nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>368.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>94.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>140.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total stock-based compensation(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>650.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>164.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (2) During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized the cumulative unrecognized stock-based compensation of $418.7 million related to our two-tier restricted stock units upon the effectiveness of our registration statement for our IPO.
