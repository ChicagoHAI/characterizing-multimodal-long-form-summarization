Our goal is to transform the way pre-owned vehicles are bought and sold by providing users with the most efficient, timely and transparent transaction experience. Our initial focus is the market for vin specific pre-owned vehicles with an emphasis on motorcycles and other powersports.\nServing both consumers and dealers, through our online marketplace platform, we make cash offers for the purchase of pre-owned vehicles. In addition, we offer a large inventory of pre-owned vehicles for sale along with third-party financing and associated products. Our operations are designed to be scalable by working through an infrastructure and capital light model that is achievable by virtue of a synergistic relationship with our regional partners, including dealers and auctions. We utilize regional partners in the acquisition of pre-owned vehicles as well as to provide inspection, reconditioning and distribution services. Correspondingly, we can earn fees and transaction income, while our regional partners can earn incremental revenue and enhance profitability through increased sales and fees from inspection, reconditioning and distribution programs.\nOur business model is driven by a technology platform we acquired in February 2017, through our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of NextGen. The acquired system provides integrated vehicle appraisal, inventory management, customer relationship and lead management, equity mining, and other key services necessary to drive the online marketplace. Over the past 16 years, the developers of the software have designed and built, for large multi-national clients, a number of dealer and, what we believe to be, high quality applications solutions.\nKey Operation Metrics\nAs our business expands we will regularly review a number of metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our progress, and make strategic decisions. Our key operating metrics reflect what we believe will be the key drivers of our growth, including increasing brand awareness, maximizing the opportunity to source the purchase of low cost pre-owned vehicles from consumers and dealers while enhancing the selection of vehicles we make available to our customers. Our key operating metrics also demonstrate our ability to translate these drivers into sales and to monetize these retail sales through a variety of product offerings.\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vehicles sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Regional partners\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average monthly unique users\n</td> <td> 97,877\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vehicle inventory available on website\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average days to sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total average gross margin per vehicle\n</td> <td> $750\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nVehicles Sold\nWe define vehicles sold as the number of pre-owned vehicles sold to consumers and dealers in each period, net of returns under our three-day return policy. We view vehicles sold as a key measure of our growth for several reasons. First, vehicles sold is the primary driver of our revenue and, indirectly, gross profit, since vehicle sales enable multiple complementary revenue streams, including financing, vehicle service contracts and trade-ins. Second, growth in vehicles sold increases the base of available customers for referrals and repeat sales. Third, growth in vehicles sold is an indicator of our ability to successfully scale our logistics, fulfillment, and customer service operations.\nRegional Partners\nOur operations are designed to be scalable by working through an infrastructure and capital light model that is achievable by virtue of a synergistic relationship with regional partners. We utilize these regional partners in the acquisition of powersport vehicles and regional partner locations provide inspection, reconditioning and distribution services. Correspondingly, we earn fees and transaction income, and regional partners earn incremental revenue and enhance profitability through increased sales, leads, and fees from inspection, reconditioning and distribution programs. As regional partners are added throughout the U.S., the cost and time associated with distribution programs will be significantly reduced as the pickup and delivery of pre-owned vehicles will become more localized thus reducing shipping costs and the average days to sale for pre-owned vehicles.\nAverage Monthly Unique Users\nWe define a monthly unique user as an individual who has visited our website within a calendar month, based on data provided by Google Analytics. We calculate average monthly unique users as the sum of monthly unique users in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period, including vehicles of our dealer partners. We view average monthly unique users as a key indicator of the strength of our brand, the effectiveness of our advertising and merchandising campaigns and consumer awareness.\nVehicle Inventory Available on Website\nWe define vehicle inventory available on website as the number of pre-owned vehicles listed for sale on our website on the last day of a given reporting period, including vehicles of our dealer partners. Until we reach an optimal pooled inventory level, we view pre-owned vehicle inventory available as a key measure of our growth. Growth in available pre-owned vehicle inventory increases the selection of pre-owned vehicles available to consumers and dealers on a nationwide basis, which we believe will allow us to increase the number of pre-owned vehicles we sell.\nAverage Days to Sale\nWe define average days to sale as the average number of days between vehicle acquisition by us and delivery to a customer for all pre-owned vehicles sold in a period. However, this metric does not include any pre-owned vehicles that remain unsold at period end. We view average days to sale as a useful metric due to its impact on pre-owned vehicle average selling price. We anticipate that average days to sale will increase in future periods until we reach an optimal pooled inventory level and fully scale our acquisition and sales channel processes.\nTotal Average Gross Margin per Vehicle\nWe define total average gross margin per vehicle as the aggregate gross margin in a given period divided by pre-owned vehicles sold in that period. Total average gross margin per vehicle is driven by sales of pre-owned vehicles to consumers and dealers which, provides an opportunity to generate finance and vehicle service contract revenue from consumer sales. We believe average gross margin per vehicle is a key measure of our growth and long-term profitability.\nCOMPONENTS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRevenue\nRevenue is derived from two primary sources: (1) the Company's online marketplace, which is the largest source of revenue and includes: (i) the sale of pre-owned vehicles through consumer and dealer sales channels; (ii) vehicle financing; (iii) vehicle service contracts; and (iv) retail merchandise sales; and (2) subscription and other fees relating to the RumbleOn software solution, which includes: (i) a vehicle appraisal process; (ii) inventory management system; (iii) customer relationship and lead management program; (iv) equity mining (v) implementation: and (vi) training.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (ii) the product or service has been provided to the customer; (iii) the amount to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (iv) the collection of the Company's payment is probable.\nSee Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 1- Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition\u201d for a further description of the Company's revenue recognition.\nPre-owned Vehicle Sales\nWe sell pre-owned vehicles through consumer and dealer sales channels. These multiple sales channels provide us the opportunity to maximize profitability through increased sales volume and lower average days to sale by selling to the channel where the opportunity is the greatest at any given time based on customer demand, market conditions or inventory availability. The number of pre-owned vehicles sold to any given channel may vary from period to period based on customer demand, market conditions and available inventory.\nPre-owned vehicle sales represent the aggregate sales of pre-owned vehicles to consumers and dealers through our website or at auctions. We generate gross profit on pre-owned vehicle sales from the difference between the vehicle selling price and our cost of sales associated with acquiring the vehicle and preparing it for sale. We expect pre-owned vehicle sales to increase as we begin to utilize a combination of brand building as well as direct response channels to efficiently source and scale our addressable markets while expanding our suite of product offerings to consumers who may wish to trade-in or to sell us their vehicle independent of a retail sale. Factors affecting pre-owned vehicle sales include the number of retail pre-owned vehicles sold and the average selling price of these vehicles. At this stage of our development, changes in both retail pre-owned vehicles sold and in average selling price will drive changes in revenue.\nThe number of pre-owned vehicles we sell depends on our volume of website traffic, our inventory levels and selection, the effectiveness of our branding and marketing efforts, the quality of our customer sales experience, our volume of referrals and repeat customers, the competitiveness of our pricing, competition and general economic conditions. On a quarterly basis, the number of pre-owned vehicles we sell is also affected by seasonality, with demand for pre-owned vehicles reaching the high point in the first half of each year, commensurate with the timing of tax refunds, and diminishing through the rest of the year, with the lowest relative level of pre-owned vehicle sales expected to occur in the fourth calendar quarter.\nOur average retail selling price depends on the mix of pre-owned vehicles we acquire and hold in inventory, retail market prices in our markets, our average days to sale, and our pricing strategy. We may choose to shift our inventory mix to higher or lower cost pre-owned vehicles, or to opportunistically raise or lower our prices relative to market to take advantage of supply or demand imbalances, which could temporarily lead to average selling prices increasing or decreasing. Additionally, we have shifted away from our initial focus on solely acquiring and selling of higher priced pre-owned Harley-Davidson motorcycles to acquiring a mix of both Harley Davidson and lower priced pre-owned powersports vehicles that is a better representation of the overall powersport market. As a result of this change in mix, we expect our average selling price of pre-owned vehicles will decline from current levels, however we anticipated the decrease in average selling price to be offset, in part, by an increase in volume sales of metric brands. We anticipate however that our gross margin percentage will be the same or could improve.\nThe number of pre-owned vehicles sold to dealers at auctions is determined based on a number of factors including: (i) filling auction sales channel market demand opportunities to maximize sales and gross margin; (ii) a need to balance the Company's overall inventory mix and quantity levels against days to sales targets; and (iii) a need to liquidate those pre-owned vehicles that do not meet the Company's quality standards to be sold through Rumbleon.com.\nOther Sales and Revenue\nWe generate other sales and revenue primarily through:\n\u25cf\nVehicle Financing. Customers can pay for their pre-owned vehicle using cash or we offer a range of finance options through unrelated third-parties such as banks or credit unions. These third-party providers generally pay us a fee either in a flat amount or in an amount equal to the difference between the interest rates charged to customers over the predetermined interest rates set by the financial institution. We may be charged back for fees in the event a contract is prepaid, defaulted upon, or terminated.\n\u25cf\nVehicle Service Contracts. At the time of pre-owned vehicle sale, we provide customers, on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors, a range of other related products and services, including EPP products and vehicle appearance protection. EPP products include extended service plans ( ESPs\u201d), which are designed to cover unexpected expenses associated with mechanical breakdowns and guaranteed asset protection ( GAP\u201d), which is intended to cover the unpaid balance on a vehicle loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft. Vehicle appearance protection includes products aimed at maintaining vehicle appearance. We receive commissions from the sale of these product and service contracts and have no contractual liability to customers for claims under these products. The EPPs and vehicle appearance protection currently offered to consumers provides coverage up to 60 months (subject to mileage limitations), while GAP covers the customer for the term of their finance contract. At that time commission revenue will be recognized at the time of sale, net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations. The reserve for cancellations will be estimated based upon historical industry experience and recent trends and will be reflected as a reduction of Other sales revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and a component of Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our risk related to contract cancellations is limited to the revenue that we receive.\n\u25cf\nRetail Merchandise Sales. We sell branded and other merchandise and accessories at events.\nSubscription and other fees\nWe generate subscription fees from regional partners under a license arrangement that provides access to our software solution and ongoing support. Regional partners and other dealers pay a monthly subscription fee for access to and ongoing support for portions of the RumbleOn software solution, which includes: (i) vehicle appraisal process; (ii) inventory management system; (iii) customer relationship and lead management program; (iv) equity mining; (v) implementations and (vi) training. Regional partners and dealers may also be charged an initial software installation and training fee. Regional Partners and dealers do not have the contractual right to take possession of the software and may cancel the license for these products and services by providing a 30-day notice. Installation and training do not have value to the user without the license and ongoing support and maintenance.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue is comprised of: (i) cost of pre-owned vehicle sales; (ii) cost of other sales and revenue products; and (iii) costs of subscription and other fees.\nCost of vehicle sales to consumers and dealers includes the cost to acquire pre-owned vehicles and the reconditioning and transportation costs associated with preparing these vehicles for resale. Vehicle acquisition costs are driven by the mix of vehicles we acquire, the source of those vehicles and supply and demand dynamics in the vehicle market. Reconditioning costs are billed by third-party providers and include parts, labor, and other repair expenses directly attributable to specific pre-owned vehicles. Transportation costs consist of costs incurred to transport the vehicles from the point of acquisition. Cost of pre-owned vehicle sales also includes any necessary adjustments to reflect vehicle inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\nCost of other sales and revenue products includes primarily the costs of (i) extended service protection; (ii) vehicle appearance products; and (iii) guaranteed asset protection.\nCost of subscription fee revenue includes the (i) cost of various data feeds from third parties; (ii) costs for hosting of the customer-facing website; (iii) commissions for new sales; and (iv) implementation and training costs for new and existing dealers.\nVehicle Gross Margin\nGross margin is generated on pre-owned vehicle sales from the difference between the vehicle selling price and our cost of sales associated with acquiring the vehicle and preparing it for sale. The aggregate dollar gross margins achieved from the consumer and dealer sales channels are different. Pre-owned vehicles sold to consumers through our website generally have the highest dollar gross margin since the vehicle is sold directly to the consumer. Pre-owned vehicles sold to dealers are sold at a price below the retail price offered to consumers, thus the dealer and RumbleOn are sharing the gross margin. Factors affecting gross margin from period to period include the mix of pre-owned vehicles we acquire and hold in inventory, retail market prices, our average days to sale, and our pricing strategy. We may opportunistically choose to shift our inventory mix to higher or lower cost vehicles, or to opportunistically raise or lower our prices relative to market to take advantage of supply or demand imbalances in our sales channels, which could temporarily lead to average selling prices and gross margins increasing or decreasing in any given channel. Additionally, the Company has shifted away from its initial focus on solely acquiring and selling higher priced pre-owned Harley-Davidson motorcycles to acquiring a mix of both Harley Davidson and lower priced pre-owned powersports vehicles that is a better representation of the overall powersport market. Because of this change in mix our average selling price of pre-owned vehicles will decline from current levels; however, we anticipate the decrease in average selling price to be offset, in part, by an increase in volume sales of metric brands. We anticipate however that our gross margin percentage will be the same or could improve.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include costs and expenses for compensation and benefits, advertising and marketing, development and operating our product procurement and distribution system, managing our logistics system, establishing our dealer partner arrangements, and other corporate overhead expenses, including expenses associated with technology development, legal, accounting, finance, and business development. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include the transportation cost associated with selling vehicles but excludes the cost of reconditioning, inspecting, and auction fees which are included in Cost of revenue. Selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase substantially in future periods as we execute and aggressively expand our business through increased marketing spending and the addition of management and support personnel to ensure we adequately develop and maintain operational, financial and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization is comprised of the: (i) amortization of capitalized and acquired technology development; and (ii) depreciation of vehicle, furniture and equipment. Depreciation and amortization will continue to increase as continued investments are made in connection with the expansion and growth of the business.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense includes interest incurred on notes payable and other long-term debt, which was used to fund, startup costs and expenses, technology development, inventory, our transportation fleet, property and equipment and the acquisition of NextGen.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States ( GAAP\u201d) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is derived from two primary sources: (1) the Company's online marketplace, which is the largest source of revenue and includes: (i) the sale of pre-owned vehicles through consumer and dealer sales channels; (ii) vehicle financing; (iii) vehicle service contracts; (iv) retail merchandise sales; and (2) subscription and other fees relating to the RumbleOn software solution, which includes: (i) a vehicle appraisal process; (ii) inventory management system; (iii) customer relationship and lead management program; (iv) equity mining; (v) implementation: and (vi) training.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (ii) the product or service has been provided to the customer; (iii) the amount to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (iv) the collection of the Company's payment is probable.\nThe Company sells pre-owned vehicles to consumers and dealers primarily through our website or regional partners, which include auctions. Revenue from pre-owned vehicle sales is recognized when the vehicle is delivered, a sales contract is signed, and the purchase price has either been received or collectability has been established, net of a reserve for returns. Our return policy allows customers to return their purchases within three days from delivery. Our reserve for sales returns is estimated using historical experience and trends. The establishment of reserves for sales returns is dependent on a number of variables. In future periods additional provisions may be necessary due to a variety of factors, including changing customer return patterns due to the maturation of the online vehicle buying market, macro- and micro- economic factors that could influence customer return behavior and future pricing environments. If these factors result in adjustments to sales returns, they could significantly impact our future operating results.\nRevenue for sales fees is recognized upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer, when the sales contract is signed, and the purchase price has either been received or collectability has been established.\nVehicle finance fee revenue is recognized upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer, when the sales contract is signed, and the financing has been arranged. The Company may be charged back for a fee in the event a contract is prepaid, defaulted upon, or terminated. Our risk related to contract cancellations is limited to the commissions that we receive. Cancellations will fluctuate depending on the customer financing default or prepayment rates and shifts in customer behavior. To the extent that actual experience differs from historical trends, there could be adjustments to our finance contract cancellation reserves.\nCommission revenue on vehicle service contracts is recognized at the time of sale, net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations. The reserve for cancellations is estimated based on historical experience and recent trends. Our risk related to contract cancellations is limited to the commissions that we receive. Cancellations will fluctuate depending on the customer financing default or prepayment rates, and shifts in customer behavior, including those related to changes in the coverage or term of the product. To the extent that actual experience differs from historical trends, there could be adjustments to our contract cancellation reserves.\nSubscription fees for access to the RumbleOn software solution are paid monthly and revenue recognition commences when the installation of the software is complete, acceptance has occurred, and collectability of a determinable amount is probable. Other fees are comprised of software installation and training. Revenue is recognized when installation and training is complete, acceptance has occurred, and collectability of a determinable amount is probable.\nVehicle Inventory\nPre-owned vehicle inventory is accounted for pursuant to ASC 330, Inventory and consists of pre-owned vehicles primarily acquired from consumers and includes the cost to acquire and recondition a pre-owned vehicle. Reconditioning costs are billed by third-party providers and includes parts, labor, and other repair expenses directly attributable to a specific vehicle. Transportation costs are expensed as incurred. Pre-owned inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Vehicle inventory cost is determined by specific identification. Net realizable value is based on the estimated selling price less costs to complete, dispose and transport the vehicles. Selling prices are derived from historical data and trends, such as sales price and inventory turn data of similar vehicles, as well as independent market resources. Each reporting period, the Company recognizes any necessary adjustments to reflect pre-owned vehicle inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is recognized in Cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nPurchase Accounting for Business Combinations\nOn February 8, 2017, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of NextGen, which was accounted under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations. Under the purchase method of accounting, the cost, including transaction costs, of approximately $4,750,000 to acquire NextGen was preliminarily allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. at the time the acquisition was consummated, the Company valued the purchase price to acquire NextGen based upon the fair value of the consideration paid which included 1,523,809 shares of Class B Common Stock issued at a negotiated fair value.\nThe judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly impact net income (loss). For example, different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ. Consequently, to the extent a longer-lived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorter-lived asset there may be less amortization recorded in a given period.\nDetermining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired requires significant judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. As provided by the accounting rules, the Company used the one-year period following the consummation of the acquisition to finalize the estimates of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. One of the areas that requires more judgment in determining fair values and useful lives is intangible assets. To assist in this process, the Company obtained an appraisal from an independent valuation firm for certain intangible assets. While there are a number of different methods used in estimating the value of the intangibles acquired, there are two approaches primarily used: discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the two approaches include: projected future cash flows (including timing); discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows; perpetual growth rate; determination of appropriate market comparables; and the determination of whether a premium or a discount should be applied to comparables. Most of these assumptions were based on available historical information. As a result of this valuation during the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company finalized the preliminary purchase price allocation recorded at the acquisition date and made a measurement period adjustment to the preliminary purchase price allocation which included: (i) an increase to technology development of $1,500,000; (ii) a decrease in goodwill of $1,390,000; (iii) a decrease to customer contracts of $10,000; and (iv) a decrease to non-compete agreements of $100,000. The measurement period adjustment also resulted in a $166,250 net increase in accumulated amortization and amortization expense previously recorded for the nine-months ended September 30, 2017. This measurement period adjustment has been recorded in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Consolidated Financial Statements as if the measurement period adjustment had been made on February 8, 2017, the date of the acquisition. The company made these measurement period adjustments to reflect facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and did not result from intervening events subsequent to such date. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Acquisitions\u201d for additional discussion.\nGoodwill\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (also known as a component). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available, and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. The Company has concluded that currently it has one reporting unit.\nWe performed our test for impairment at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 using a two-step quantitative process. Under the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and step two of the impairment test (measurement) must be performed. Step two of the impairment test, if necessary, requires the estimation of the fair value for the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit in order to calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined by management and includes the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Management utilized the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow technique as a means for estimating fair value. This discounted cash flow analysis requires various assumptions including those about future cash flows, transactional and customer growth rates and discount rates. Expected cash flows will be based on historical customer growth and the growth in transactions, including attrition, future strategic initiatives and continued long-term growth of the business. The discount rates used for the analysis will reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk and size risk premiums. These estimates can be affected by factors such as customer and transaction growth, pricing, and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. There was no impairment of goodwill as of December 31, 2017.\nCommon Stock Warrants\nThe Company accounts for common stock warrants in accordance with applicable accounting guidance provided in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity, as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement. Any warrants that (i) require physical settlement or net-share settlement or (ii) provide the Company with a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement) provided that such warrants are indexed to the Company's own stock is classified as equity. The Company classifies as assets or liabilities any warrants that (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the Company's control), (ii) gives the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement) or (iii) that contain reset provisions that do not qualify for the scope exception. The Company assesses classification of its common stock warrants at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification between assets and liabilities is required. The Company's freestanding derivatives consisting of 218,250 warrants to purchase common stock that were issued to underwriters in connection with the October 23, 2017 public offering of Class B common stock satisfied the criteria for classification as equity instruments as these warrants do not contain cash settlement features or variable settlement provision that cause them to not be indexed to the Company's own common stock. We use the Black-Scholes pricing model to value the derivative warrant as an equity instrument. The Black-Scholes pricing model, which is based, in part, upon unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which requires the Company to develop its own assumptions for: (i) risk-free interest rate; (ii) volatility of the market price of the Company's common stock; and (iii) expected dividend yield. As a result, if factors change and different assumptions are used, the warrant equity value and the change in estimated fair value could be materially different. Generally, as the market price of our common stock increases, the fair value of the warrant increases, and conversely, as the market price of our common stock decreases, the fair value of the warrant decreases. Also, a significant increase in the volatility of the market price of the Company's common stock, in isolation, would result in a significantly higher fair value measurement; and a significant decrease in volatility would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement.\nStock Based Compensation\nThe Company is required to make estimates and assumptions related to our valuation and recording of stock-based compensation expense under current accounting standards. These standards require all share-based compensation to employees to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their respective grant date fair values over the requisite service periods and also requires an estimation of forfeitures when calculating compensation expense.\nOn June 30, 2017, the Company's shareholders approved a Stock Incentive Plan (the Plan\u201d) under which restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) and other equity awards may be granted to employees and non-employee members of the Board of Directors. Twelve percent (12%) of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock from time to time are reserved for issuance under the Plan. The Company estimates the fair value of awards granted under the Plan on the date of grant. The fair value of an RSU is based on the average of the high and low market prices of the Company's Class B Common Stock on the date of grant and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over its vesting period. Stock incentive plans requires judgment, including estimating the expected term the award will be outstanding, volatility of the market price of the Company's common stock and the amount of the awards that are expected to be forfeited. We have estimated forfeitures based on historic employee behavior under similar stock-based compensation plans. The fair value of stock-based compensation is affected by the assumptions selected. A significant increase in the market price of the Company's common stock, in isolation, would result in a significantly higher fair value measurement on future issuances; and a significant decrease in would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement on future issuances. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies-Stock-Based Compensation.\u201d\nNewly Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company has adopted Accounting Standards Update 2015-11 Inventory (Topic 330), Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires inventory to be stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Vehicle inventory cost is determined by specific identification. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less costs to complete, dispose and transport the vehicles. Selling prices are derived from historical data and trends, such as sales price and inventory turn times of similar vehicles, as well as independent, market resources. Each reporting period the Company recognizes any necessary adjustments to reflect vehicle inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value through cost of revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance, ASU No. 2017-4, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the test for Goodwill Impairment. This guidance simplifies subsequent goodwill measurement by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under this update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The new standard is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted for annual goodwill impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. The standard must be applied prospectively. Upon adoption, the standard will impact how the Company assesses goodwill for impairment.

The increase in revenue was driven by the initial launch of our e-commerce platform, including the launch of the RumbleOn website, expanded inventory selection, enhanced social media advertising, aggressive event marketing efforts, increased brand awareness and customer referrals. We anticipate that pre-owned vehicle sales will continue to grow as we increase our available online pre-owned vehicle inventory while continuing to efficiently source and scale our addressable markets of consumers and dealers through brand building and direct response marketing.\nSales of pre-owned vehicles to consumers and dealers through our online marketplace increased $7,020,070 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016.

The average selling price of the pre-owned vehicles sold for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $10,363. The average selling price of pre-owned vehicles sold will fluctuate from period to period as a result of changes in the sales mix to consumers and dealers in any given period. The Company continues to transition from its initial focus on solely acquiring and selling higher priced Harley-Davidson motorcycles to acquiring a mix of both Harley Davidson and lower priced powersports vehicles that is a better representation of the overall powersport market. Because of this change in mix our average selling price will decline from current levels; however, we anticipate the decrease in average selling price to be offset, in part, by an increase in volume sales of metric brands. We anticipate however that our gross margin percentage will be the same or could improve from current levels.

( NextGear\u201d) in the amount of $2,000,000, or such lesser sum which may be advanced to or on behalf of the Borrower from time to time, pursuant to that certain Demand Promissory Note and Loan and Security Agreement.

At the time of the notification, there was no indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Line.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016\nOn July 13, 2016, the Company entered into an unsecured convertible note (the BHLP Note\u201d) with Berrard Holdings, an entity owned and controlled by a current officer and director, Mr. Berrard, pursuant to which the Company was required to repay $191,858 on or before July 13, 2026 plus interest at 6% per annum. The BHLP Note was also convertible into common stock, in whole, at any time before maturity at the option of the holder at the greater of $0.06 per share or 50% of the price per share of the next qualified financing which is defined as $500,000 or greater. Effective August 31, 2016, the principal amount of the BHLP Note was amended to include an additional $5,500 loaned to the Company, on the same terms. On November 28, 2016, the Company completed its qualified financing at $1.50 per share which established the conversion price per share for the BHLP Note of $0.75 per share, resulting in the principal amount of the BHLP Note being convertible into 263,144 shares of Class B Common Stock. As such, November 28, 2016 became the commitment date\u201d for determining the value of the BHLP Note conversion feature. Because there had been no trading in the Company's common stock since July 2014, other than the purchase by Berrard Holdings of 99.5% of the outstanding shares in a single transaction, the Company used the Monte Carlo simulation to determine the intrinsic value of the conversion feature of the BHLP Note, which resulted in a value in excess of the principal amount of the BHLP Note. Thus, the Company recorded a note discount of $197,358 with the corresponding amount as an addition to paid in capital. This note discount was amortized to interest expense until the scheduled maturity of the BHLP Note in July 2026 or until it was converted using the effective interest method. On March 31, 2017, the Company issued 275,312 shares of Class B Common Stock upon full conversion of the BHLP Note, having an aggregate principal amount, including accrued interest, of $206,484 and a conversion price of $0.75 per share. In connection with the conversion of the BHLP Note, the remaining debt discount of $196,076 was charged to interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the related deferred tax liability was credited to Additional paid in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 5-Notes Payable\u201d for additional discussion.\nOn November 28, 2016, the Company completed a private placement with certain purchasers, with respect to the sale of an aggregate of 900,000 shares of common stock of the Company at a purchase price of $1.50 per share for total consideration of $1,350,000 (the 2016 Private Placement\u201d). In connection with the 2016 Private Placement, the Company also entered into loan agreements, pursuant to which the purchasers would loan to the Company their pro rata share of up to $1,350,000 in the aggregate upon the request of the Company at any time on or after January 31, 2017 and before November 1, 2020. On March 31, 2017, the Company completed the second tranche of the 2016 Private Placement. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 5-Notes Payable\u201d for additional discussion.\u201d\nInvestment in Growth\nAt December 31, 2017, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $9,170,652. Since inception, our operations have been financed primarily by net proceeds from the sales of shares of our Class B common stock and proceeds from the issuance of indebtedness. We have incurred cumulative losses of $9,019,300 from our operations through December 31, 2017 and expect to incur additional losses in the future. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, our cash requirements for the next twelve months are significant as we have begun to aggressively invest in the growth of our business and we expect this investment to continue. We plan to invest heavily in inventory, marketing, technology and infrastructure to support the growth of the business. These investments are expected to increase our negative cash flow from operations and operating losses at least in the near term, and our limited operating history makes predictions of future operating results difficult to ascertain. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies that are early in their development, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. Such risks for us include an evolving business model, advancement of technology and the management of growth. To address these risks, we must, among other things, continue our development of relevant applications, stay abreast of changes in the marketplace, as well as implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so can have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlso, on February 16, 2018, the Company, through Borrower, entered into an Inventory Financing and Security Agreement (the Credit Facility\u201d) with Ally Bank, a Utah chartered state bank ( Ally Bank\u201d) and Ally Financial, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Ally\u201d together with Ally Bank, the Lender\u201d), pursuant to which the Lender may provide up to $25 million in financing, or such lesser sum which may be advanced to or on behalf of the Borrower from time to time, as part of its floorplan vehicle financing program. Advances under the Credit Facility require the Company maintain 10.0% of the advance amount as restricted cash. Advances under the Credit Facility will bear interest at a per annum rate designated from time to time by the Lender and will be determined using a 365/360 simple interest method of calculation, unless expressly prohibited by law. Advances under the Credit Facility, if not demanded earlier, are due and payable for each vehicle financed under the Credit Facility as and when such vehicle is sold, leased, consigned, gifted, exchanged, transferred, or otherwise disposed of. Interest under the Credit Facility is due and payable upon demand, but, in general, in no event later than 60 days from the date of request for payment. Upon any event of default (including, without limitation, the Borrower's obligation to pay upon demand any outstanding liabilities of the Credit Facility), the Lender may, at its option and without notice to the Borrower, exercise its right to demand immediate payment of all liabilities and other indebtedness and amounts owed to Lender and its affiliates by the Borrower and its affiliates. The Credit Facility is secured by a grant of a security interest in the vehicle inventory and other assets of the Borrower and payment is guaranteed by the Company pursuant to a guaranty in favor of the Lender, and secured by the Company pursuant to a General Security Agreement.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2017, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nEmerging Growth Company\nWe are an emerging growth company\u201d under the federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing not to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements and involves risks and uncertainties that could materially affect expected results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, and business prospects.

Our goal is to transform the way pre-owned vehicles are bought and sold by providing users with the most efficient, timely and transparent transaction experience. Our initial focus is the market for vin specific pre-owned vehicles with an emphasis on motorcycles and other powersports.\nServing both consumers and dealers, through our online marketplace platform, we make cash offers for the purchase of pre-owned vehicles. In addition, we offer a large inventory of pre-owned vehicles for sale along with third-party financing and associated products. Our operations are designed to be scalable by working through an infrastructure and capital light model that is achievable by virtue of a synergistic relationship with our regional partners, including dealers and auctions. We utilize regional partners in the acquisition of pre-owned vehicles as well as to provide inspection, reconditioning and distribution services. Correspondingly, we can earn fees and transaction income, while our regional partners can earn incremental revenue and enhance profitability through increased sales and fees from inspection, reconditioning and distribution programs.\nOur business model is driven by a technology platform we acquired in February 2017, through our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of NextGen. The acquired system provides integrated vehicle appraisal, inventory management, customer relationship and lead management, equity mining, and other key services necessary to drive the online marketplace. Over the past 16 years, the developers of the software have designed and built, for large multi-national clients, a number of dealer and, what we believe to be, high quality applications solutions.\nKey Operation Metrics\nAs our business expands we will regularly review a number of metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our progress, and make strategic decisions. Our key operating metrics reflect what we believe will be the key drivers of our growth, including increasing brand awareness, maximizing the opportunity to source the purchase of low cost pre-owned vehicles from consumers and dealers while enhancing the selection of vehicles we make available to our customers. Our key operating metrics also demonstrate our ability to translate these drivers into sales and to monetize these retail sales through a variety of product offerings.\n\nVehicles Sold\nWe define vehicles sold as the number of pre-owned vehicles sold to consumers and dealers in each period, net of returns under our three-day return policy. We view vehicles sold as a key measure of our growth for several reasons. First, vehicles sold is the primary driver of our revenue and, indirectly, gross profit, since vehicle sales enable multiple complementary revenue streams, including financing, vehicle service contracts and trade-ins. Second, growth in vehicles sold increases the base of available customers for referrals and repeat sales. Third, growth in vehicles sold is an indicator of our ability to successfully scale our logistics, fulfillment, and customer service operations.\nRegional Partners\nOur operations are designed to be scalable by working through an infrastructure and capital light model that is achievable by virtue of a synergistic relationship with regional partners. We utilize these regional partners in the acquisition of powersport vehicles and regional partner locations provide inspection, reconditioning and distribution services. Correspondingly, we earn fees and transaction income, and regional partners earn incremental revenue and enhance profitability through increased sales, leads, and fees from inspection, reconditioning and distribution programs. As regional partners are added throughout the U.S., the cost and time associated with distribution programs will be significantly reduced as the pickup and delivery of pre-owned vehicles will become more localized thus reducing shipping costs and the average days to sale for pre-owned vehicles.\nAverage Monthly Unique Users\nWe define a monthly unique user as an individual who has visited our website within a calendar month, based on data provided by Google Analytics. We calculate average monthly unique users as the sum of monthly unique users in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period, including vehicles of our dealer partners. We view average monthly unique users as a key indicator of the strength of our brand, the effectiveness of our advertising and merchandising campaigns and consumer awareness.\nVehicle Inventory Available on Website\nWe define vehicle inventory available on website as the number of pre-owned vehicles listed for sale on our website on the last day of a given reporting period, including vehicles of our dealer partners. Until we reach an optimal pooled inventory level, we view pre-owned vehicle inventory available as a key measure of our growth. Growth in available pre-owned vehicle inventory increases the selection of pre-owned vehicles available to consumers and dealers on a nationwide basis, which we believe will allow us to increase the number of pre-owned vehicles we sell.\nAverage Days to Sale\nWe define average days to sale as the average number of days between vehicle acquisition by us and delivery to a customer for all pre-owned vehicles sold in a period. However, this metric does not include any pre-owned vehicles that remain unsold at period end. We view average days to sale as a useful metric due to its impact on pre-owned vehicle average selling price. We anticipate that average days to sale will increase in future periods until we reach an optimal pooled inventory level and fully scale our acquisition and sales channel processes.\nTotal Average Gross Margin per Vehicle\nWe define total average gross margin per vehicle as the aggregate gross margin in a given period divided by pre-owned vehicles sold in that period. Total average gross margin per vehicle is driven by sales of pre-owned vehicles to consumers and dealers which, provides an opportunity to generate finance and vehicle service contract revenue from consumer sales. We believe average gross margin per vehicle is a key measure of our growth and long-term profitability.\nCOMPONENTS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRevenue\nRevenue is derived from two primary sources: (1) the Company's online marketplace, which is the largest source of revenue and includes: (i) the sale of pre-owned vehicles through consumer and dealer sales channels; (ii) vehicle financing; (iii) vehicle service contracts; and (iv) retail merchandise sales; and (2) subscription and other fees relating to the RumbleOn software solution, which includes: (i) a vehicle appraisal process; (ii) inventory management system; (iii) customer relationship and lead management program; (iv) equity mining (v) implementation: and (vi) training.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (ii) the product or service has been provided to the customer; (iii) the amount to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (iv) the collection of the Company's payment is probable.\nSee Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 1- Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition\u201d for a further description of the Company's revenue recognition.\nPre-owned Vehicle Sales\nWe sell pre-owned vehicles through consumer and dealer sales channels. These multiple sales channels provide us the opportunity to maximize profitability through increased sales volume and lower average days to sale by selling to the channel where the opportunity is the greatest at any given time based on customer demand, market conditions or inventory availability. The number of pre-owned vehicles sold to any given channel may vary from period to period based on customer demand, market conditions and available inventory.\nPre-owned vehicle sales represent the aggregate sales of pre-owned vehicles to consumers and dealers through our website or at auctions. We generate gross profit on pre-owned vehicle sales from the difference between the vehicle selling price and our cost of sales associated with acquiring the vehicle and preparing it for sale. We expect pre-owned vehicle sales to increase as we begin to utilize a combination of brand building as well as direct response channels to efficiently source and scale our addressable markets while expanding our suite of product offerings to consumers who may wish to trade-in or to sell us their vehicle independent of a retail sale. Factors affecting pre-owned vehicle sales include the number of retail pre-owned vehicles sold and the average selling price of these vehicles. At this stage of our development, changes in both retail pre-owned vehicles sold and in average selling price will drive changes in revenue.\nThe number of pre-owned vehicles we sell depends on our volume of website traffic, our inventory levels and selection, the effectiveness of our branding and marketing efforts, the quality of our customer sales experience, our volume of referrals and repeat customers, the competitiveness of our pricing, competition and general economic conditions. On a quarterly basis, the number of pre-owned vehicles we sell is also affected by seasonality, with demand for pre-owned vehicles reaching the high point in the first half of each year, commensurate with the timing of tax refunds, and diminishing through the rest of the year, with the lowest relative level of pre-owned vehicle sales expected to occur in the fourth calendar quarter.\nOur average retail selling price depends on the mix of pre-owned vehicles we acquire and hold in inventory, retail market prices in our markets, our average days to sale, and our pricing strategy. We may choose to shift our inventory mix to higher or lower cost pre-owned vehicles, or to opportunistically raise or lower our prices relative to market to take advantage of supply or demand imbalances, which could temporarily lead to average selling prices increasing or decreasing. Additionally, we have shifted away from our initial focus on solely acquiring and selling of higher priced pre-owned Harley-Davidson motorcycles to acquiring a mix of both Harley Davidson and lower priced pre-owned powersports vehicles that is a better representation of the overall powersport market. As a result of this change in mix, we expect our average selling price of pre-owned vehicles will decline from current levels, however we anticipated the decrease in average selling price to be offset, in part, by an increase in volume sales of metric brands. We anticipate however that our gross margin percentage will be the same or could improve.\nThe number of pre-owned vehicles sold to dealers at auctions is determined based on a number of factors including: (i) filling auction sales channel market demand opportunities to maximize sales and gross margin; (ii) a need to balance the Company's overall inventory mix and quantity levels against days to sales targets; and (iii) a need to liquidate those pre-owned vehicles that do not meet the Company's quality standards to be sold through Rumbleon.com.\nOther Sales and Revenue\nWe generate other sales and revenue primarily through:\n\u25cf\nVehicle Financing. Customers can pay for their pre-owned vehicle using cash or we offer a range of finance options through unrelated third-parties such as banks or credit unions. These third-party providers generally pay us a fee either in a flat amount or in an amount equal to the difference between the interest rates charged to customers over the predetermined interest rates set by the financial institution. We may be charged back for fees in the event a contract is prepaid, defaulted upon, or terminated.\n\u25cf\nVehicle Service Contracts. At the time of pre-owned vehicle sale, we provide customers, on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors, a range of other related products and services, including EPP products and vehicle appearance protection. EPP products include extended service plans ( ESPs\u201d), which are designed to cover unexpected expenses associated with mechanical breakdowns and guaranteed asset protection ( GAP\u201d), which is intended to cover the unpaid balance on a vehicle loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft. Vehicle appearance protection includes products aimed at maintaining vehicle appearance. We receive commissions from the sale of these product and service contracts and have no contractual liability to customers for claims under these products. The EPPs and vehicle appearance protection currently offered to consumers provides coverage up to 60 months (subject to mileage limitations), while GAP covers the customer for the term of their finance contract. At that time commission revenue will be recognized at the time of sale, net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations. The reserve for cancellations will be estimated based upon historical industry experience and recent trends and will be reflected as a reduction of Other sales revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and a component of Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our risk related to contract cancellations is limited to the revenue that we receive.\n\u25cf\nRetail Merchandise Sales. We sell branded and other merchandise and accessories at events.\nSubscription and other fees\nWe generate subscription fees from regional partners under a license arrangement that provides access to our software solution and ongoing support. Regional partners and other dealers pay a monthly subscription fee for access to and ongoing support for portions of the RumbleOn software solution, which includes: (i) vehicle appraisal process; (ii) inventory management system; (iii) customer relationship and lead management program; (iv) equity mining; (v) implementations and (vi) training. Regional partners and dealers may also be charged an initial software installation and training fee. Regional Partners and dealers do not have the contractual right to take possession of the software and may cancel the license for these products and services by providing a 30-day notice. Installation and training do not have value to the user without the license and ongoing support and maintenance.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue is comprised of: (i) cost of pre-owned vehicle sales; (ii) cost of other sales and revenue products; and (iii) costs of subscription and other fees.\nCost of vehicle sales to consumers and dealers includes the cost to acquire pre-owned vehicles and the reconditioning and transportation costs associated with preparing these vehicles for resale. Vehicle acquisition costs are driven by the mix of vehicles we acquire, the source of those vehicles and supply and demand dynamics in the vehicle market. Reconditioning costs are billed by third-party providers and include parts, labor, and other repair expenses directly attributable to specific pre-owned vehicles. Transportation costs consist of costs incurred to transport the vehicles from the point of acquisition. Cost of pre-owned vehicle sales also includes any necessary adjustments to reflect vehicle inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\nCost of other sales and revenue products includes primarily the costs of (i) extended service protection; (ii) vehicle appearance products; and (iii) guaranteed asset protection.\nCost of subscription fee revenue includes the (i) cost of various data feeds from third parties; (ii) costs for hosting of the customer-facing website; (iii) commissions for new sales; and (iv) implementation and training costs for new and existing dealers.\nVehicle Gross Margin\nGross margin is generated on pre-owned vehicle sales from the difference between the vehicle selling price and our cost of sales associated with acquiring the vehicle and preparing it for sale. The aggregate dollar gross margins achieved from the consumer and dealer sales channels are different. Pre-owned vehicles sold to consumers through our website generally have the highest dollar gross margin since the vehicle is sold directly to the consumer. Pre-owned vehicles sold to dealers are sold at a price below the retail price offered to consumers, thus the dealer and RumbleOn are sharing the gross margin. Factors affecting gross margin from period to period include the mix of pre-owned vehicles we acquire and hold in inventory, retail market prices, our average days to sale, and our pricing strategy. We may opportunistically choose to shift our inventory mix to higher or lower cost vehicles, or to opportunistically raise or lower our prices relative to market to take advantage of supply or demand imbalances in our sales channels, which could temporarily lead to average selling prices and gross margins increasing or decreasing in any given channel. Additionally, the Company has shifted away from its initial focus on solely acquiring and selling higher priced pre-owned Harley-Davidson motorcycles to acquiring a mix of both Harley Davidson and lower priced pre-owned powersports vehicles that is a better representation of the overall powersport market. Because of this change in mix our average selling price of pre-owned vehicles will decline from current levels; however, we anticipate the decrease in average selling price to be offset, in part, by an increase in volume sales of metric brands. We anticipate however that our gross margin percentage will be the same or could improve.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include costs and expenses for compensation and benefits, advertising and marketing, development and operating our product procurement and distribution system, managing our logistics system, establishing our dealer partner arrangements, and other corporate overhead expenses, including expenses associated with technology development, legal, accounting, finance, and business development. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include the transportation cost associated with selling vehicles but excludes the cost of reconditioning, inspecting, and auction fees which are included in Cost of revenue. Selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase substantially in future periods as we execute and aggressively expand our business through increased marketing spending and the addition of management and support personnel to ensure we adequately develop and maintain operational, financial and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization is comprised of the: (i) amortization of capitalized and acquired technology development; and (ii) depreciation of vehicle, furniture and equipment. Depreciation and amortization will continue to increase as continued investments are made in connection with the expansion and growth of the business.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense includes interest incurred on notes payable and other long-term debt, which was used to fund, startup costs and expenses, technology development, inventory, our transportation fleet, property and equipment and the acquisition of NextGen.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States ( GAAP\u201d) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is derived from two primary sources: (1) the Company's online marketplace, which is the largest source of revenue and includes: (i) the sale of pre-owned vehicles through consumer and dealer sales channels; (ii) vehicle financing; (iii) vehicle service contracts; (iv) retail merchandise sales; and (2) subscription and other fees relating to the RumbleOn software solution, which includes: (i) a vehicle appraisal process; (ii) inventory management system; (iii) customer relationship and lead management program; (iv) equity mining; (v) implementation: and (vi) training.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (ii) the product or service has been provided to the customer; (iii) the amount to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (iv) the collection of the Company's payment is probable.\nThe Company sells pre-owned vehicles to consumers and dealers primarily through our website or regional partners, which include auctions. Revenue from pre-owned vehicle sales is recognized when the vehicle is delivered, a sales contract is signed, and the purchase price has either been received or collectability has been established, net of a reserve for returns. Our return policy allows customers to return their purchases within three days from delivery. Our reserve for sales returns is estimated using historical experience and trends. The establishment of reserves for sales returns is dependent on a number of variables. In future periods additional provisions may be necessary due to a variety of factors, including changing customer return patterns due to the maturation of the online vehicle buying market, macro- and micro- economic factors that could influence customer return behavior and future pricing environments. If these factors result in adjustments to sales returns, they could significantly impact our future operating results.\nRevenue for sales fees is recognized upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer, when the sales contract is signed, and the purchase price has either been received or collectability has been established.\nVehicle finance fee revenue is recognized upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer, when the sales contract is signed, and the financing has been arranged. The Company may be charged back for a fee in the event a contract is prepaid, defaulted upon, or terminated. Our risk related to contract cancellations is limited to the commissions that we receive. Cancellations will fluctuate depending on the customer financing default or prepayment rates and shifts in customer behavior. To the extent that actual experience differs from historical trends, there could be adjustments to our finance contract cancellation reserves.\nCommission revenue on vehicle service contracts is recognized at the time of sale, net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations. The reserve for cancellations is estimated based on historical experience and recent trends. Our risk related to contract cancellations is limited to the commissions that we receive. Cancellations will fluctuate depending on the customer financing default or prepayment rates, and shifts in customer behavior, including those related to changes in the coverage or term of the product. To the extent that actual experience differs from historical trends, there could be adjustments to our contract cancellation reserves.\nSubscription fees for access to the RumbleOn software solution are paid monthly and revenue recognition commences when the installation of the software is complete, acceptance has occurred, and collectability of a determinable amount is probable. Other fees are comprised of software installation and training. Revenue is recognized when installation and training is complete, acceptance has occurred, and collectability of a determinable amount is probable.\nVehicle Inventory\nPre-owned vehicle inventory is accounted for pursuant to ASC 330, Inventory and consists of pre-owned vehicles primarily acquired from consumers and includes the cost to acquire and recondition a pre-owned vehicle. Reconditioning costs are billed by third-party providers and includes parts, labor, and other repair expenses directly attributable to a specific vehicle. Transportation costs are expensed as incurred. Pre-owned inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Vehicle inventory cost is determined by specific identification. Net realizable value is based on the estimated selling price less costs to complete, dispose and transport the vehicles. Selling prices are derived from historical data and trends, such as sales price and inventory turn data of similar vehicles, as well as independent market resources. Each reporting period, the Company recognizes any necessary adjustments to reflect pre-owned vehicle inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is recognized in Cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nPurchase Accounting for Business Combinations\nOn February 8, 2017, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of NextGen, which was accounted under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations. Under the purchase method of accounting, the cost, including transaction costs, of approximately $4,750,000 to acquire NextGen was preliminarily allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. at the time the acquisition was consummated, the Company valued the purchase price to acquire NextGen based upon the fair value of the consideration paid which included 1,523,809 shares of Class B Common Stock issued at a negotiated fair value.\nThe judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly impact net income (loss). For example, different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ. Consequently, to the extent a longer-lived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorter-lived asset there may be less amortization recorded in a given period.\nDetermining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired requires significant judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. As provided by the accounting rules, the Company used the one-year period following the consummation of the acquisition to finalize the estimates of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. One of the areas that requires more judgment in determining fair values and useful lives is intangible assets. To assist in this process, the Company obtained an appraisal from an independent valuation firm for certain intangible assets. While there are a number of different methods used in estimating the value of the intangibles acquired, there are two approaches primarily used: discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the two approaches include: projected future cash flows (including timing); discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows; perpetual growth rate; determination of appropriate market comparables; and the determination of whether a premium or a discount should be applied to comparables. Most of these assumptions were based on available historical information. As a result of this valuation during the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company finalized the preliminary purchase price allocation recorded at the acquisition date and made a measurement period adjustment to the preliminary purchase price allocation which included: (i) an increase to technology development of $1,500,000; (ii) a decrease in goodwill of $1,390,000; (iii) a decrease to customer contracts of $10,000; and (iv) a decrease to non-compete agreements of $100,000. The measurement period adjustment also resulted in a $166,250 net increase in accumulated amortization and amortization expense previously recorded for the nine-months ended September 30, 2017. This measurement period adjustment has been recorded in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Consolidated Financial Statements as if the measurement period adjustment had been made on February 8, 2017, the date of the acquisition. The company made these measurement period adjustments to reflect facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and did not result from intervening events subsequent to such date. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Acquisitions\u201d for additional discussion.\nGoodwill\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (also known as a component). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available, and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. The Company has concluded that currently it has one reporting unit.\nWe performed our test for impairment at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 using a two-step quantitative process. Under the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and step two of the impairment test (measurement) must be performed. Step two of the impairment test, if necessary, requires the estimation of the fair value for the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit in order to calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined by management and includes the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Management utilized the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow technique as a means for estimating fair value. This discounted cash flow analysis requires various assumptions including those about future cash flows, transactional and customer growth rates and discount rates. Expected cash flows will be based on historical customer growth and the growth in transactions, including attrition, future strategic initiatives and continued long-term growth of the business. The discount rates used for the analysis will reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk and size risk premiums. These estimates can be affected by factors such as customer and transaction growth, pricing, and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. There was no impairment of goodwill as of December 31, 2017.\nCommon Stock Warrants\nThe Company accounts for common stock warrants in accordance with applicable accounting guidance provided in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity, as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement. Any warrants that (i) require physical settlement or net-share settlement or (ii) provide the Company with a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement) provided that such warrants are indexed to the", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes included in this annual report.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nRumbleOn operates a capital light disruptive e-commerce platform facilitating the ability of both consumers and dealers to Buy-Sell-Trade-Finance pre-owned vehicles in one online location. Our goal is to transform the way pre-owned vehicles are bought and sold by providing users with the most efficient, timely and transparent transaction experience. Our initial focus is the market for vin specific pre-owned vehicles with an emphasis on motorcycles and other powersports.\nServing both consumers and dealers, through our online marketplace platform, we make cash offers for the purchase of pre-owned vehicles. In addition, we offer a large inventory of pre-owned vehicles for sale along with third-party financing and associated products. Our operations are designed to be scalable by working through an infrastructure and capital light model that is achievable by virtue of a synergistic relationship with our regional partners, including dealers and auctions. We utilize regional partners in the acquisition of pre-owned vehicles as well as to provide inspection, reconditioning and distribution services. Correspondingly, we can earn fees and transaction income, while our regional partners can earn incremental revenue and enhance profitability through increased sales and fees from inspection, reconditioning and distribution programs.\nOur business model is driven by a technology platform we acquired in February 2017, through our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of NextGen. The acquired system provides integrated vehicle appraisal, inventory management, customer relationship and lead management, equity mining, and other key services necessary to drive the online marketplace. Over the past 16 years, the developers of the software have designed and built, for large multi-national clients, a number of dealer and, what we believe to be, high quality applications solutions.\nKey Operation Metrics\nAs our business expands we will regularly review a number of metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our progress, and make strategic decisions. Our key operating metrics reflect what we believe will be the key drivers of our growth, including increasing brand awareness, maximizing the opportunity to source the purchase of low cost pre-owned vehicles from consumers and dealers while enhancing the selection of vehicles we make available to our customers. Our key operating metrics also demonstrate our ability to translate these drivers into sales and to monetize these retail sales through a variety of product offerings.\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vehicles sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Regional partners\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average monthly unique users\n</td> <td> 97,877\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vehicle inventory available on website\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average days to sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total average gross margin per vehicle\n</td> <td> $750\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nVehicles Sold\nWe define vehicles sold as the number of pre-owned vehicles sold to consumers and dealers in each period, net of returns under our three-day return policy. We view vehicles sold as a key measure of our growth for several reasons. First, vehicles sold is the primary driver of our revenue and, indirectly, gross profit, since vehicle sales enable multiple complementary revenue streams, including financing, vehicle service contracts and trade-ins. Second, growth in vehicles sold increases the base of available customers for referrals and repeat sales. Third, growth in vehicles sold is an indicator of our ability to successfully scale our logistics, fulfillment, and customer service operations.\nRegional Partners\nOur operations are designed to be scalable by working through an infrastructure and capital light model that is achievable by virtue of a synergistic relationship with regional partners. We utilize these regional partners in the acquisition of powersport vehicles and regional partner locations provide inspection, reconditioning and distribution services. Correspondingly, we earn fees and transaction income, and regional partners earn incremental revenue and enhance profitability through increased sales, leads, and fees from inspection, reconditioning and distribution programs. As regional partners are added throughout the U.S., the cost and time associated with distribution programs will be significantly reduced as the pickup and delivery of pre-owned vehicles will become more localized thus reducing shipping costs and the average days to sale for pre-owned vehicles.\nAverage Monthly Unique Users\nWe define a monthly unique user as an individual who has visited our website within a calendar month, based on data provided by Google Analytics. We calculate average monthly unique users as the sum of monthly unique users in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period, including vehicles of our dealer partners. We view average monthly unique users as a key indicator of the strength of our brand, the effectiveness of our advertising and merchandising campaigns and consumer awareness.\nVehicle Inventory Available on Website\nWe define vehicle inventory available on website as the number of pre-owned vehicles listed for sale on our website on the last day of a given reporting period, including vehicles of our dealer partners. Until we reach an optimal pooled inventory level, we view pre-owned vehicle inventory available as a key measure of our growth. Growth in available pre-owned vehicle inventory increases the selection of pre-owned vehicles available to consumers and dealers on a nationwide basis, which we believe will allow us to increase the number of pre-owned vehicles we sell.\nAverage Days to Sale\nWe define average days to sale as the average number of days between vehicle acquisition by us and delivery to a customer for all pre-owned vehicles sold in a period. However, this metric does not include any pre-owned vehicles that remain unsold at period end. We view average days to sale as a useful metric due to its impact on pre-owned vehicle average selling price. We anticipate that average days to sale will increase in future periods until we reach an optimal pooled inventory level and fully scale our acquisition and sales channel processes.\nTotal Average Gross Margin per Vehicle\nWe define total average gross margin per vehicle as the aggregate gross margin in a given period divided by pre-owned vehicles sold in that period. Total average gross margin per vehicle is driven by sales of pre-owned vehicles to consumers and dealers which, provides an opportunity to generate finance and vehicle service contract revenue from consumer sales. We believe average gross margin per vehicle is a key measure of our growth and long-term profitability.\nCOMPONENTS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRevenue\nRevenue is derived from two primary sources: (1) the Company's online marketplace, which is the largest source of revenue and includes: (i) the sale of pre-owned vehicles through consumer and dealer sales channels; (ii) vehicle financing; (iii) vehicle service contracts; and (iv) retail merchandise sales; and (2) subscription and other fees relating to the RumbleOn software solution, which includes: (i) a vehicle appraisal process; (ii) inventory management system; (iii) customer relationship and lead management program; (iv) equity mining (v) implementation: and (vi) training.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (ii) the product or service has been provided to the customer; (iii) the amount to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (iv) the collection of the Company's payment is probable.\nSee Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 1- Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition\u201d for a further description of the Company's revenue recognition.\nPre-owned Vehicle Sales\nWe sell pre-owned vehicles through consumer and dealer sales channels. These multiple sales channels provide us the opportunity to maximize profitability through increased sales volume and lower average days to sale by selling to the channel where the opportunity is the greatest at any given time based on customer demand, market conditions or inventory availability. The number of pre-owned vehicles sold to any given channel may vary from period to period based on customer demand, market conditions and available inventory.\nPre-owned vehicle sales represent the aggregate sales of pre-owned vehicles to consumers and dealers through our website or at auctions. We generate gross profit on pre-owned vehicle sales from the difference between the vehicle selling price and our cost of sales associated with acquiring the vehicle and preparing it for sale. We expect pre-owned vehicle sales to increase as we begin to utilize a combination of brand building as well as direct response channels to efficiently source and scale our addressable markets while expanding our suite of product offerings to consumers who may wish to trade-in or to sell us their vehicle independent of a retail sale. Factors affecting pre-owned vehicle sales include the number of retail pre-owned vehicles sold and the average selling price of these vehicles. At this stage of our development, changes in both retail pre-owned vehicles sold and in average selling price will drive changes in revenue.\nThe number of pre-owned vehicles we sell depends on our volume of website traffic, our inventory levels and selection, the effectiveness of our branding and marketing efforts, the quality of our customer sales experience, our volume of referrals and repeat customers, the competitiveness of our pricing, competition and general economic conditions. On a quarterly basis, the number of pre-owned vehicles we sell is also affected by seasonality, with demand for pre-owned vehicles reaching the high point in the first half of each year, commensurate with the timing of tax refunds, and diminishing through the rest of the year, with the lowest relative level of pre-owned vehicle sales expected to occur in the fourth calendar quarter.\nOur average retail selling price depends on the mix of pre-owned vehicles we acquire and hold in inventory, retail market prices in our markets, our average days to sale, and our pricing strategy. We may choose to shift our inventory mix to higher or lower cost pre-owned vehicles, or to opportunistically raise or lower our prices relative to market to take advantage of supply or demand imbalances, which could temporarily lead to average selling prices increasing or decreasing. Additionally, we have shifted away from our initial focus on solely acquiring and selling of higher priced pre-owned Harley-Davidson motorcycles to acquiring a mix of both Harley Davidson and lower priced pre-owned powersports vehicles that is a better representation of the overall powersport market. As a result of this change in mix, we expect our average selling price of pre-owned vehicles will decline from current levels, however we anticipated the decrease in average selling price to be offset, in part, by an increase in volume sales of metric brands. We anticipate however that our gross margin percentage will be the same or could improve.\nThe number of pre-owned vehicles sold to dealers at auctions is determined based on a number of factors including: (i) filling auction sales channel market demand opportunities to maximize sales and gross margin; (ii) a need to balance the Company's overall inventory mix and quantity levels against days to sales targets; and (iii) a need to liquidate those pre-owned vehicles that do not meet the Company's quality standards to be sold through Rumbleon.com.\nOther Sales and Revenue\nWe generate other sales and revenue primarily through:\n\u25cf\nVehicle Financing. Customers can pay for their pre-owned vehicle using cash or we offer a range of finance options through unrelated third-parties such as banks or credit unions. These third-party providers generally pay us a fee either in a flat amount or in an amount equal to the difference between the interest rates charged to customers over the predetermined interest rates set by the financial institution. We may be charged back for fees in the event a contract is prepaid, defaulted upon, or terminated.\n\u25cf\nVehicle Service Contracts. At the time of pre-owned vehicle sale, we provide customers, on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors, a range of other related products and services, including EPP products and vehicle appearance protection. EPP products include extended service plans ( ESPs\u201d), which are designed to cover unexpected expenses associated with mechanical breakdowns and guaranteed asset protection ( GAP\u201d), which is intended to cover the unpaid balance on a vehicle loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft. Vehicle appearance protection includes products aimed at maintaining vehicle appearance. We receive commissions from the sale of these product and service contracts and have no contractual liability to customers for claims under these products. The EPPs and vehicle appearance protection currently offered to consumers provides coverage up to 60 months (subject to mileage limitations), while GAP covers the customer for the term of their finance contract. At that time commission revenue will be recognized at the time of sale, net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations. The reserve for cancellations will be estimated based upon historical industry experience and recent trends and will be reflected as a reduction of Other sales revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and a component of Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our risk related to contract cancellations is limited to the revenue that we receive.\n\u25cf\nRetail Merchandise Sales. We sell branded and other merchandise and accessories at events.\nSubscription and other fees\nWe generate subscription fees from regional partners under a license arrangement that provides access to our software solution and ongoing support. Regional partners and other dealers pay a monthly subscription fee for access to and ongoing support for portions of the RumbleOn software solution, which includes: (i) vehicle appraisal process; (ii) inventory management system; (iii) customer relationship and lead management program; (iv) equity mining; (v) implementations and (vi) training. Regional partners and dealers may also be charged an initial software installation and training fee. Regional Partners and dealers do not have the contractual right to take possession of the software and may cancel the license for these products and services by providing a 30-day notice. Installation and training do not have value to the user without the license and ongoing support and maintenance.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue is comprised of: (i) cost of pre-owned vehicle sales; (ii) cost of other sales and revenue products; and (iii) costs of subscription and other fees.\nCost of vehicle sales to consumers and dealers includes the cost to acquire pre-owned vehicles and the reconditioning and transportation costs associated with preparing these vehicles for resale. Vehicle acquisition costs are driven by the mix of vehicles we acquire, the source of those vehicles and supply and demand dynamics in the vehicle market. Reconditioning costs are billed by third-party providers and include parts, labor, and other repair expenses directly attributable to specific pre-owned vehicles. Transportation costs consist of costs incurred to transport the vehicles from the point of acquisition. Cost of pre-owned vehicle sales also includes any necessary adjustments to reflect vehicle inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\nCost of other sales and revenue products includes primarily the costs of (i) extended service protection; (ii) vehicle appearance products; and (iii) guaranteed asset protection.\nCost of subscription fee revenue includes the (i) cost of various data feeds from third parties; (ii) costs for hosting of the customer-facing website; (iii) commissions for new sales; and (iv) implementation and training costs for new and existing dealers.\nVehicle Gross Margin\nGross margin is generated on pre-owned vehicle sales from the difference between the vehicle selling price and our cost of sales associated with acquiring the vehicle and preparing it for sale. The aggregate dollar gross margins achieved from the consumer and dealer sales channels are different. Pre-owned vehicles sold to consumers through our website generally have the highest dollar gross margin since the vehicle is sold directly to the consumer. Pre-owned vehicles sold to dealers are sold at a price below the retail price offered to consumers, thus the dealer and RumbleOn are sharing the gross margin. Factors affecting gross margin from period to period include the mix of pre-owned vehicles we acquire and hold in inventory, retail market prices, our average days to sale, and our pricing strategy. We may opportunistically choose to shift our inventory mix to higher or lower cost vehicles, or to opportunistically raise or lower our prices relative to market to take advantage of supply or demand imbalances in our sales channels, which could temporarily lead to average selling prices and gross margins increasing or decreasing in any given channel. Additionally, the Company has shifted away from its initial focus on solely acquiring and selling higher priced pre-owned Harley-Davidson motorcycles to acquiring a mix of both Harley Davidson and lower priced pre-owned powersports vehicles that is a better representation of the overall powersport market. Because of this change in mix our average selling price of pre-owned vehicles will decline from current levels; however, we anticipate the decrease in average selling price to be offset, in part, by an increase in volume sales of metric brands. We anticipate however that our gross margin percentage will be the same or could improve.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include costs and expenses for compensation and benefits, advertising and marketing, development and operating our product procurement and distribution system, managing our logistics system, establishing our dealer partner arrangements, and other corporate overhead expenses, including expenses associated with technology development, legal, accounting, finance, and business development. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include the transportation cost associated with selling vehicles but excludes the cost of reconditioning, inspecting, and auction fees which are included in Cost of revenue. Selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase substantially in future periods as we execute and aggressively expand our business through increased marketing spending and the addition of management and support personnel to ensure we adequately develop and maintain operational, financial and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization is comprised of the: (i) amortization of capitalized and acquired technology development; and (ii) depreciation of vehicle, furniture and equipment. Depreciation and amortization will continue to increase as continued investments are made in connection with the expansion and growth of the business.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense includes interest incurred on notes payable and other long-term debt, which was used to fund, startup costs and expenses, technology development, inventory, our transportation fleet, property and equipment and the acquisition of NextGen.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States ( GAAP\u201d) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is derived from two primary sources: (1) the Company's online marketplace, which is the largest source of revenue and includes: (i) the sale of pre-owned vehicles through consumer and dealer sales channels; (ii) vehicle financing; (iii) vehicle service contracts; (iv) retail merchandise sales; and (2) subscription and other fees relating to the RumbleOn software solution, which includes: (i) a vehicle appraisal process; (ii) inventory management system; (iii) customer relationship and lead management program; (iv) equity mining; (v) implementation: and (vi) training.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (ii) the product or service has been provided to the customer; (iii) the amount to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (iv) the collection of the Company's payment is probable.\nThe Company sells pre-owned vehicles to consumers and dealers primarily through our website or regional partners, which include auctions. Revenue from pre-owned vehicle sales is recognized when the vehicle is delivered, a sales contract is signed, and the purchase price has either been received or collectability has been established, net of a reserve for returns. Our return policy allows customers to return their purchases within three days from delivery. Our reserve for sales returns is estimated using historical experience and trends. The establishment of reserves for sales returns is dependent on a number of variables. In future periods additional provisions may be necessary due to a variety of factors, including changing customer return patterns due to the maturation of the online vehicle buying market, macro- and micro- economic factors that could influence customer return behavior and future pricing environments. If these factors result in adjustments to sales returns, they could significantly impact our future operating results.\nRevenue for sales fees is recognized upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer, when the sales contract is signed, and the purchase price has either been received or collectability has been established.\nVehicle finance fee revenue is recognized upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer, when the sales contract is signed, and the financing has been arranged. The Company may be charged back for a fee in the event a contract is prepaid, defaulted upon, or terminated. Our risk related to contract cancellations is limited to the commissions that we receive. Cancellations will fluctuate depending on the customer financing default or prepayment rates and shifts in customer behavior. To the extent that actual experience differs from historical trends, there could be adjustments to our finance contract cancellation reserves.\nCommission revenue on vehicle service contracts is recognized at the time of sale, net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations. The reserve for cancellations is estimated based on historical experience and recent trends. Our risk related to contract cancellations is limited to the commissions that we receive. Cancellations will fluctuate depending on the customer financing default or prepayment rates, and shifts in customer behavior, including those related to changes in the coverage or term of the product. To the extent that actual experience differs from historical trends, there could be adjustments to our contract cancellation reserves.\nSubscription fees for access to the RumbleOn software solution are paid monthly and revenue recognition commences when the installation of the software is complete, acceptance has occurred, and collectability of a determinable amount is probable. Other fees are comprised of software installation and training. Revenue is recognized when installation and training is complete, acceptance has occurred, and collectability of a determinable amount is probable.\nVehicle Inventory\nPre-owned vehicle inventory is accounted for pursuant to ASC 330, Inventory and consists of pre-owned vehicles primarily acquired from consumers and includes the cost to acquire and recondition a pre-owned vehicle. Reconditioning costs are billed by third-party providers and includes parts, labor, and other repair expenses directly attributable to a specific vehicle. Transportation costs are expensed as incurred. Pre-owned inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Vehicle inventory cost is determined by specific identification. Net realizable value is based on the estimated selling price less costs to complete, dispose and transport the vehicles. Selling prices are derived from historical data and trends, such as sales price and inventory turn data of similar vehicles, as well as independent market resources. Each reporting period, the Company recognizes any necessary adjustments to reflect pre-owned vehicle inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is recognized in Cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nPurchase Accounting for Business Combinations\nOn February 8, 2017, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of NextGen, which was accounted under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations. Under the purchase method of accounting, the cost, including transaction costs, of approximately $4,750,000 to acquire NextGen was preliminarily allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. at the time the acquisition was consummated, the Company valued the purchase price to acquire NextGen based upon the fair value of the consideration paid which included 1,523,809 shares of Class B Common Stock issued at a negotiated fair value.\nThe judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly impact net income (loss). For example, different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ. Consequently, to the extent a longer-lived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorter-lived asset there may be less amortization recorded in a given period.\nDetermining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired requires significant judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. As provided by the accounting rules, the Company used the one-year period following the consummation of the acquisition to finalize the estimates of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. One of the areas that requires more judgment in determining fair values and useful lives is intangible assets. To assist in this process, the Company obtained an appraisal from an independent valuation firm for certain intangible assets. While there are a number of different methods used in estimating the value of the intangibles acquired, there are two approaches primarily used: discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the two approaches include: projected future cash flows (including timing); discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows; perpetual growth rate; determination of appropriate market comparables; and the determination of whether a premium or a discount should be applied to comparables. Most of these assumptions were based on available historical information. As a result of this valuation during the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company finalized the preliminary purchase price allocation recorded at the acquisition date and made a measurement period adjustment to the preliminary purchase price allocation which included: (i) an increase to technology development of $1,500,000; (ii) a decrease in goodwill of $1,390,000; (iii) a decrease to customer contracts of $10,000; and (iv) a decrease to non-compete agreements of $100,000. The measurement period adjustment also resulted in a $166,250 net increase in accumulated amortization and amortization expense previously recorded for the nine-months ended September 30, 2017. This measurement period adjustment has been recorded in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Consolidated Financial Statements as if the measurement period adjustment had been made on February 8, 2017, the date of the acquisition. The company made these measurement period adjustments to reflect facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and did not result from intervening events subsequent to such date. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Acquisitions\u201d for additional discussion.\nGoodwill\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (also known as a component). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available, and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. The Company has concluded that currently it has one reporting unit.\nWe performed our test for impairment at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 using a two-step quantitative process. Under the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and step two of the impairment test (measurement) must be performed. Step two of the impairment test, if necessary, requires the estimation of the fair value for the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit in order to calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined by management and includes the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Management utilized the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow technique as a means for estimating fair value. This discounted cash flow analysis requires various assumptions including those about future cash flows, transactional and customer growth rates and discount rates. Expected cash flows will be based on historical customer growth and the growth in transactions, including attrition, future strategic initiatives and continued long-term growth of the business. The discount rates used for the analysis will reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk and size risk premiums. These estimates can be affected by factors such as customer and transaction growth, pricing, and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. There was no impairment of goodwill as of December 31, 2017.\nCommon Stock Warrants\nThe Company accounts for common stock warrants in accordance with applicable accounting guidance provided in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity, as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement.
