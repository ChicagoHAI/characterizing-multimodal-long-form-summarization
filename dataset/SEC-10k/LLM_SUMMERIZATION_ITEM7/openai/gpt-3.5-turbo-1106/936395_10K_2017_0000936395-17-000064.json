Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report.\nOverview\nWe are a network strategy and technology company, providing solutions that enable a wide range of network operators to deploy and manage next-generation communication architectures that deliver a broad array of services. We provide network hardware, software and services that support the transport, switching, aggregation, service delivery and management of video, data, and voice traffic on communications networks. Our high-capacity hardware and network management and control software solutions enable open, programmable networks that enhance automation, reduce network complexity and support changing service requirements. Our solutions create business and operational value for our customers by enabling them to introduce new revenue-generating services and reduce network costs.\nOur solutions include a diverse set of Networking Platform products, which are used by a broad range of network operator customers and market segments, including communications service providers, cable and multiservice operators, Web-scale providers, submarine network operators, governments, enterprises, research and education (R&E) institutions, and other emerging network operators. These products, which can be applied from the network core to network access points, allow network operators to scale capacity, increase transmission speeds, allocate traffic and adapt dynamically to changing end-user service demands. In addition to our portfolio of high-capacity hardware systems and components, we offer network management and domain control software platforms, along with advanced applications software, designed to simplify the creation, automation and delivery of services across multi-vendor and multi-domain network environments. To complement our hardware and software solutions, we offer a broad range of services that help our customers design, optimize, integrate, deploy, manage and maintain their networks.\nOur quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, annual reports on Form 10-K, and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC are available through the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file these documents. We routinely post the reports above, recent news and announcements, financial results and other information about Ciena that is important to investors in the Investors\u201d section of our website at www.ciena.com. Investors are encouraged to review the Investors\u201d section of our website because, as with the other disclosure channels that we use, from time to time we may post material information on that site that is not otherwise disseminated by us.\nMarket Opportunity\nThe markets in which we sell our communications networking solutions have seen significant changes in recent years, including rapid growth in bandwidth demand, proliferation of cloud-based services and heightened end-user service demands. We have also seen the impact of Web-scale network operators and their services on service provider architectures. These conditions have placed significant demands on networks, challenged the business models of network operators, and altered the overall competitive landscape of network operators. Existing and emerging network operators are competing to distinguish their service offerings and rapidly introduce differentiated, revenue-generating services, while managing the costs of their networks and seeking to ensure a profitable business model. We believe that these dynamics, and the need to adapt to rapidly changing business and network demands, will cause network operators to leverage increased software-based network control and programmability, and that network operators will adopt or evolve their infrastructures to be more open, programmable and automated.\nWhile drivers of bandwidth growth and network evolution remain strong, our customers are under constant pressure to constrain their capital expenditure budgets and cannot grow their network spending at the rate of bandwidth growth. As a result, as we innovate and introduce new and more robust solutions that increase capacity or features, there is a market expectation of solutions that are more cost-effective than existing or competing solutions. The combination of this regular technology-driven price compression in our industry and ongoing customer efforts to manage network costs can impact growth rates in our markets, and requires that we increase our volume of product shipments to grow revenue. During fiscal 2017, we saw slower market growth rates in a number of our geographies. Notwithstanding these market dynamics, we grew annual revenue and benefited meaningfully from our continued efforts to diversify our business and to take market share from competitors. Specifically, we continued to diversify our customer base to include additional customer segments, such as Web-scale providers and data center operators and enterprise customers, which contributed to our growth in North America during fiscal 2017. We also benefited from geographic diversification and growth of our business in Asia-Pacific during fiscal 2017,\nincluding sales to additional service provider customers in India. We believe that continued diversification of our business and share capture are important parts of our strategy and necessary for continued revenue growth.\nOur strategy to capitalize on these market dynamics and drive the profitable growth of our business includes the initiatives set forth in the Strategy\u201d section of the description of our business in Item 1 of Part 1 of this annual report.\nCompetitive Landscape\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, frequent introduction of new networking solutions and aggressive selling and pricing efforts to gain or retain market share. The markets for our solutions are both highly competitive and fragmented, as we regularly compete with number of large, multi-national vendors with greater financial, operational and marketing resources, and significantly broader product offerings. Our sales of Converged Packet Optical solutions face an intense competitive environment as we and our competitors introduce new, higher-capacity, higher-speed network solutions with improved reach, spectral efficiency, automation, power consumption and cost per bit. We expect competition in our industry to continue to broaden and to remain challenging and dynamic. As we expand our Packet Networking solutions and our Waveserver DCI platform, our solutions have become increasingly competitive with IP router vendors, data center switch providers, and other IT suppliers or integrators. Similarly, as we seek increased customer adoption of our Blue Planet software platform, we expect to compete more directly with additional software vendors and information technology vendors or integrators of these solutions.\nNetwork operators are pursuing a variety of consumption models,\u201d or approaches to the design and procurement of their network infrastructure. While broader adoption of procurement models that emphasize disaggregation of hardware and software remains uncertain, we expect that a diversity of consumption models will require us and other system vendors to broaden our existing offering and commercial models over time. We may face competition from component vendors, including those in our supply chain, that develop networking products based on off-the-shelf or commoditized hardware technology, referred to as white box\u201d hardware. Further, some of our competitors, both large and small, are not vertically integrated in their packet optical supply chain, and sell solutions that rely upon third-party coherent modem technology from merchant modem providers. We may compete with these providers as we pursue merchant modem sales opportunities. We have entered into global distribution relationships to sell our WaveLogic coherent optical technology into this market through Lumentum, NeoPhotonics and Oclaro. Each has the unrestricted ability to sell such optical modules to end users, including our customers, our competitors, and other vendors or network operators that plan to build or use white box\u201d hardware. Accordingly, we may ultimately compete with these partners in the marketplace. In connection with consumption models involving greater disaggregation, the continued use of such third-party modem technology and/or the availability of such technology in the market may increase overall pricing pressure in this space and may negatively impact our ability to derive higher gross margins for Converged Packet Optical solutions.\nSee the Industry Background\u201d and Competition\u201d sections of the description of our business in Item 1 of Part 1 of this annual report for more information related to the competitive landscape of our markets.\nBalance Sheet Initiatives\nShare Repurchase Authorization. On December 7, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $300 million of our outstanding common stock through the end of fiscal 2020. We may purchase shares at management's discretion in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, in transactions structured through investment banking institutions, or a combination of the foregoing. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of shares under this authorization. The amount and timing of repurchases are subject to a variety of factors including liquidity, cash flow, stock price, and general business and market conditions.\nExchange Offer for 2018 Convertible Notes to Add Cash Settlement Conversion Options. On August 2, 2017, we completed an offer to exchange our currently outstanding 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (the Original Notes\u201d) for a new series of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (the New Notes\u201d) and an exchange fee of $2.50 per $1,000 original principal amount. The New Notes give us the option, at our election, to settle conversions of the New Notes for cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares. It is our current intent that upon any conversion of the New Notes we will settle the principal amount thereof in cash. Accordingly, we used the treasury stock method for the New Notes in our diluted earnings per share calculation starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Following settlement of the exchange offer, approximately $61.3 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of Original Notes and $288.7 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of New Notes were outstanding. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for more information relating to our outstanding convertible notes.\nRepurchase and Repayment at Maturity of 0.875% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2017. During fiscal 2017, we repurchased $46.3 million of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 0.875% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2017 (the 2017 Notes\u201d) in private transactions. We repaid in cash the remaining $185.3 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2017 Notes at maturity on June 15, 2017.\nTerm Loan Refinancing. On January 30, 2017, we refinanced our existing term loans in the aggregate principal amount of $250 million, maturing on July 15, 2019 (the \"2019 Term Loan\") and $250 million, maturing on April 25, 2021 (the \"2021 Term Loan\") into a single term loan with an aggregate principal amount of $400 million maturing on January 30, 2022 (the 2022 Term Loan\u201d). The remaining balances under the 2019 Term Loan and 2021 Term Loan were refinanced and replaced by the 2022 Term Loan and the aggregate amount of borrowing was reduced. This arrangement was accounted for as a modification of debt. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for more information relating to our term loan refinancing.\nReversal of Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance\nOur fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2017 results of operations reflect a non-cash $1.1 billion deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversal. See Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for more information relating to this reversal. The value of the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet as of October 31, 2017 would decrease significantly if the U.S. corporate income tax rate is reduced, as proposed in tax reform legislation recently passed by both houses of the U.S. Congress on December 20, 2017. Consequently, if the President signs this proposed legislation into law as expected, we expect that our results of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 would be materially adversely affected by a non-cash charge to reflect the reduction in value of these assets.\nFinancial Results for Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2017 and Sequential Comparison\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $744.4 million, representing a sequential increase of 2.2% from $728.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Revenue-related details reflecting sequential changes from the third quarter of fiscal 2017 include the following:\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Product revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 increased by $5.5 million, primarily reflecting an increase of $6.6 million in Networking Platforms partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 million in software platforms within our Software-Related Services segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Services revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 increased by $10.2 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>North America revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $440.5 million, a decrease from $465.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.

AT&T accounted for 16.6% and Verizon accounted for 11.4% of total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was 43.7%, a decrease from 45.0% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The reduced gross margin was primarily due to aggressive efforts to take market share from competitors and secure new customers and the effects of the early stages of these deployments. Our gross margin can fluctuate, particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis, as a result of a number of factors, including the additional costs we incur associated with the early stages of new network deployments that typically include a higher concentration of lower margin common\u201d equipment sales. Part of our strategy for fiscal 2018 is to leverage our technology leadership and to aggressively capture additional market share and displace competitors, particularly with communications service providers internationally. Accordingly, we may encounter fluctuations or reductions in quarterly gross margin during this period.\nOperating expense was $269.9 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, a $23.8 million increase from $246.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. This reflects increases of $9.1 million in selling and marketing expense, primarily due to increased incentive sales compensation and $1.4 million in research and development expenses. Operating expense also reflects a $13.7 million significant asset impairment related to a trade receivable for a single customer in the APAC region. No revenue was recognized from this customer in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and $4.8 million of the impairment was related to revenue recorded during the first nine months of fiscal 2017.\nIncome from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $55.8 million, as compared to $82.0 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Our net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $1.2 billion, or $7.32 per diluted common share which reflects a tax benefit of $1.1 billion related to the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance. This compares to a net income of $60.0 million or $0.39 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nWe generated $138.5 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. This compares with $50.6 million in cash generated from operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. As of October 31, 2017, we had $640.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, $279.1 million of short-term investments in U.S. treasury securities and commercial paper and $49.8 million of long-term investments in U.S. treasury securities. This compares to $559.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, $234.7 million of short-term investments in U.S. treasury securities and commercial paper, and $59.9 million of long-term investments in U.S. treasury securities at July 31, 2017.\nAs of October 31, 2017, we had 5,737 employees, a decrease from 5,780 as of July 31, 2017 and an increase from 5,555 and 5,345 at October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nOperating Segments\nCiena has the following operating segments for reporting purposes: (i) Networking Platforms, (ii) Software and Software-Related Services, and (iii) Global Services. See Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.\nFiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016\nRevenue\nDuring fiscal 2017, approximately 17.4% of our revenue was non-U.S. Dollar denominated, including sales in Euros, Canadian Dollars, Brazilian Reais, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. During fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against these currencies. Consequently, our revenue reported in U.S. Dollars was slightly reduced by approximately $4.9 million, or 0.2%, as compared to fiscal 2016 due to fluctuations in foreign currency. The table below (in thousands, except percentage data) sets forth the changes in our operating segment revenue for the periods indicated:\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

Results for North America include only activities in the United States and Canada. Part of our business and growth strategy is to continue to diversify our customer base and secure additional service provider customers outside of North America, including in high-growth geographies such as India. We believe that this is an important part of our strategy, and that it is required for continued revenue growth. The following table reflects our geographic distribution of revenue principally based on the relevant location for our delivery of products and performance of services. Our revenue, particularly when considered by geographic distribution, can fluctuate significantly and the timing of revenue recognition for large network projects, particularly outside of North America, can result in large variations in geographic revenue results in any particular quarter.

A sizable portion of our revenue continues to be derived from sales to large service provider customers. Consequently, our financial results are closely correlated with the spending of a relatively small number of customers and can be significantly affected by market, industry or competitive dynamics affecting their businesses. Our reliance upon a relatively small number of customers also increases our exposure to changes in their spending levels, network priorities and purchasing strategies. The loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and our results of operations can fluctuate quarterly depending upon sales volumes and purchasing priorities with these large customers.\nSales to AT&T were $448.9 million, or 16.0% of total revenue in fiscal 2017, and $479.1 million, or 18.4% of total revenue in fiscal 2016. Verizon accounted for $288.0 million or 10.3% of total revenue for fiscal 2017. Some customers, including AT&T, are pursuing network strategies that seek to utilize enhanced software programmability, management and control of networks and to deploy off-the-shelf or commoditized hardware technology, referred to as white box\u201d hardware, in lieu of existing solutions. These strategies may present challenges and opportunities for our business, particularly where we are an incumbent equipment vendor. No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue in fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2016.\nAs our business has diversified, we have taken a number of steps to increase the velocity of our business and improve our operating efficiency, including through inventory management and lead time reduction. As a result, the percentage of quarterly product revenue that we generate from customer orders placed during that particular quarter has increased meaningfully, as compared to our historical periods. Our increased reliance upon orders placed during a particular quarter may make it harder to predict our revenue and results of operations, and may further increase the likelihood of fluctuations in our results.\nCost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit\nProduct cost of goods sold consists primarily of amounts paid to third-party contract manufacturers, component costs, employee-related costs and overhead, shipping and logistics costs associated with manufacturing-related operations, warranty and other contractual obligations, royalties, license fees, amortization of intangible assets, cost of excess and obsolete inventory and, when applicable, estimated losses on committed customer contracts.\nServices cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct and third-party costs associated with our provision of services including installation, deployment, maintenance support, consulting and training activities and, when applicable, estimated losses on committed customer contracts. The majority of these costs relate to personnel, including employee and third-party contractor-related costs.\nOur gross profit as a percentage of revenue, or gross margin,\u201d has remained relatively consistent in recent fiscal years. However, gross margin, particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis, can fluctuate due to a number of factors. Our gross margin remains highly dependent upon on our continued ability to drive product cost reductions relative to the price erosion that we regularly encounter in our markets. Moreover, we are often required to compete with aggressive pricing and commercial terms and to secure business with new and existing customers we may agree to pricing or other unfavorable commercial terms that adversely affect our gross margin. Our success in taking share and winning new business can result in additional costs associated with the early stages of network deployments, including an increased concentration of lower margin common\u201d equipment sales and installation services, as compared to higher margin products including channel cards, software services and maintenance services. Gross margin can be impacted by technology-based price compression and the introduction or substitution of new platforms for existing solutions that carry higher margins. Gross margin can also be impacted by changes in expense for excess and obsolete inventory and warranty obligations and our revenue concentration within a particular segment, product line, geography, or customer.\nService gross margin can be affected by the mix of customers and services, particularly the mix between deployment and maintenance services, geographic mix and the timing and extent of any investments in internal resources to support this business.\nThe tables below (in thousands, except percentage data) set forth the changes in revenue, cost of goods sold and gross profit for the

Expense\nOperating expense increased in fiscal 2017 from the level reported for fiscal 2016 primarily due to increased research and development initiatives, investments in information technology related to the re-engineering of company-wide enterprise resource planning platforms, and the transition costs of key facilities. In particular, the development of our new facilities and the transition of our operations in Ottawa, Canada required significant effort, time and cost. For additional information regarding this lease and the facility transitions, see Item 2 of Part I of this annual report.\nOperating expense consists of the component elements described below.\nResearch and development expense primarily consists of salaries and related employee expense (including share-based compensation expense), prototype costs relating to design, development, and testing of our products, depreciation expense and third-party consulting costs.\nSelling and marketing expense primarily consists of salaries, incentive-based sales commissions and related employee expense (including share-based compensation expense), and sales and marketing support expense, including travel, demonstration units, trade show expense and third-party consulting costs.\nGeneral and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and related employee expense (including share-based compensation expense), and costs for third-party consulting and other services.\nAmortization of intangible assets primarily reflects the amortization of both purchased technology and the value of customer relationships derived from our acquisitions.\nAcquisition and integration costs consist of expenses for financial, legal and accounting advisors and severance and other employee-related costs, associated with our acquisition activity.\nSignificant asset impairments and restructuring costs primarily reflect actions we have taken to better align our workforce, facilities and operating costs with perceived market opportunities, business strategies and changes in market and business conditions and significant impairment of assets.\nDuring fiscal 2017, approximately 51.8% of our operating expense was non-U.S. Dollar denominated, including Canadian Dollars, British Pounds, Euros, Indian Rupees and Brazilian Reais. During fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against these currencies. Consequently, our operating expense reported in U.S. Dollars was slightly reduced by approximately $2.1 million, or 0.2%, as compared to fiscal 2016 due to fluctuations in foreign currency.

For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, we generated $234.9 million in cash to fund our operating needs, as our net income (adjusted for non-cash charges) of $390.6 million exceeded our working capital requirements of $155.7 million. Our net income (adjusted for non-cash charges) reflects a non-cash tax benefit of $1.1 billion related to a reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance. For additional details on this reversal, see Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. For additional details of our cash from operations, see the discussion below entitled Cash from Operations.\u201d\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and investments decreased by $173.6 million during fiscal 2017. This decrease principally reflects the use of cash to:\n\u2022fund the repurchase of $46.3 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2017 notes;\n\u2022repay at maturity the remaining $185.3 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2017 Notes; and\nTable 280: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>reduce the principal balance of our outstanding Term Loans by $93.6 million in connection with the refinancing and consolidation of our 2019 and 2021Term Loans into a new 2022 Term Loan.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for information relating to these transactions. The decrease also reflects cash used in investing activities for capital expenditures totaling $94.6 million, and our settlement of certain foreign currency forward contracts of $2.8 million and cash used in financing activities for capital lease obligations totaling $3.6 million and payments on our term loans of $2.0 million. Proceeds from the issuance of equity under our employee stock purchase plans provided approximately $20.4 million in cash during the period. The following table sets forth changes in our cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities (in thousands):\nTable 281: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>640,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>777,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(137,102\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments in marketable debt securities\n</td> <td>279,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>275,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term investments in marketable debt securities\n</td> <td>49,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40,389\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>969,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,143,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(173,606\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrincipal Sources of Liquidity. Our principal sources of liquidity on hand include our cash and investments, which as of October 31, 2017 totaled $1.0 billion, as well as our ABL credit facility. Ciena and certain of its subsidiaries are parties to a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Facility\u201d) providing for a total commitment of $250 million with a maturity date of December 31, 2020. We principally use the ABL Credit Facility to support the issuance of letters of credit that arise in the ordinary course of our business and thereby to reduce our use of cash required to collateralize these instruments. As of October 31, 2017, letters of credit totaling $69.6 million were collateralized by our ABL Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility as of October 31, 2017.\nForeign Liquidity. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries was $41.6 million as of October 31, 2017. Given this amount, we do not believe that there are significant amounts held by foreign subsidiaries in which we consider earnings to be permanently reinvested, that may not be available for U.S. operations. In the event such funds held by our foreign subsidiaries were repatriated, we believe that any resulting tax implications would not be material.\nIntent to Cash Settle New 2018 Convertible Notes. As more fully described in Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report, following the settlement of an exchange offer on August 2, 2017, approximately $288.7 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of Original Notes were exchanged for New Notes, which provide us with the option, at our election, to settle conversions for cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares. It is our current intent that upon any conversion of the New Notes we will settle the principal amount thereof in cash.\nShare Repurchase Authorization. On December 7, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $300 million of our outstanding common stock through the end of fiscal 2020. We may purchase shares at management's discretion in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, in transactions structured through investment banking institutions, or a combination of the foregoing. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of shares under this authorization. The amount and timing of repurchases are subject to a variety of factors including liquidity, cash flow, stock price, and general business and market conditions.\nLiquidity Position. We regularly evaluate our liquidity position, debt obligations, and anticipated cash needs to fund our operating or investment plans and may consider capital raising and other market opportunities that may be available to us.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report.\nOverview\nWe are a network strategy and technology company, providing solutions that enable a wide range of network operators to deploy and manage next-generation communication architectures that deliver a broad array of services. We provide network hardware, software and services that support the transport, switching, aggregation, service delivery and management of video, data, and voice traffic on communications networks. Our high-capacity hardware and network management and control software solutions enable open, programmable networks that enhance automation, reduce network complexity and support changing service requirements. Our solutions create business and operational value for our customers by enabling them to introduce new revenue-generating services and reduce network costs.\nOur solutions include a diverse set of Networking Platform products, which are used by a broad range of network operator customers and market segments, including communications service providers, cable and multiservice operators, Web-scale providers, submarine network operators, governments, enterprises, research and education (R&E) institutions, and other emerging network operators. These products, which can be applied from the network core to network access points, allow network operators to scale capacity, increase transmission speeds, allocate traffic and adapt dynamically to changing end-user service demands. In addition to our portfolio of high-capacity hardware systems and components, we offer network management and domain control software platforms, along with advanced applications software, designed to simplify the creation, automation and delivery of services across multi-vendor and multi-domain network environments. To complement our hardware and software solutions, we offer a broad range of services that help our customers design, optimize, integrate, deploy, manage and maintain their networks.\nOur quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, annual reports on Form 10-K, and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC are available through the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file these documents. We routinely post the reports above, recent news and announcements, financial results and other information about Ciena that is important to investors in the Investors\u201d section of our website at www.ciena.com. Investors are encouraged to review the Investors\u201d section of our website because, as with the other disclosure channels that we use, from time to time we may post material information on that site that is not otherwise disseminated by us.\nMarket Opportunity\nThe markets in which we sell our communications networking solutions have seen significant changes in recent years, including rapid growth in bandwidth demand, proliferation of cloud-based services and heightened end-user service demands. We have also seen the impact of Web-scale network operators and their services on service provider architectures. These conditions have placed significant demands on networks, challenged the business models of network operators, and altered the overall competitive landscape of network operators. Existing and emerging network operators are competing to distinguish their service offerings and rapidly introduce differentiated, revenue-generating services, while managing the costs of their networks and seeking to ensure a profitable business model. We believe that these dynamics, and the need to adapt to rapidly changing business and network demands, will cause network operators to leverage increased software-based network control and programmability, and that network operators will adopt or evolve their infrastructures to be more open, programmable and automated.\nWhile drivers of bandwidth growth and network evolution remain strong, our customers are under constant pressure to constrain their capital expenditure budgets and cannot grow their network spending at the rate of bandwidth growth. As a result, as we innovate and introduce new and more robust solutions that increase capacity or features, there is a market expectation of solutions that are more cost-effective than existing or competing solutions. The combination of this regular technology-driven price compression in our industry and ongoing customer efforts to manage network costs can impact growth rates in our markets, and requires that we increase our volume of product shipments to grow revenue. During fiscal 2017, we saw slower market growth rates in a number of our geographies. Notwithstanding these market dynamics, we grew annual revenue and benefited meaningfully from our continued efforts to diversify our business and to take market share from competitors. Specifically, we continued to diversify our customer base to include additional customer segments, such as Web-scale providers and data center operators and enterprise customers, which contributed to our growth in North America during fiscal 2017. We also benefited from geographic diversification and growth of our business in Asia-Pacific during fiscal 2017,\nincluding sales to additional service provider customers in India. We believe that continued diversification of our business and share capture are important parts of our strategy and necessary for continued revenue growth.\nOur strategy to capitalize on these market dynamics and drive the profitable growth of our business includes the initiatives set forth in the Strategy\u201d section of the description of our business in Item 1 of Part 1 of this annual report.\nCompetitive Landscape\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, frequent introduction of new networking solutions and aggressive selling and pricing efforts to gain or retain market share. The markets for our solutions are both highly competitive and fragmented, as we regularly compete with number of large, multi-national vendors with greater financial, operational and marketing resources, and significantly broader product offerings. Our sales of Converged Packet Optical solutions face an intense competitive environment as we and our competitors introduce new, higher-capacity, higher-speed network solutions with improved reach, spectral efficiency, automation, power consumption and cost per bit. We expect competition in our industry to continue to broaden and to remain challenging and dynamic. As we expand our Packet Networking solutions and our Waveserver DCI platform, our solutions have become increasingly competitive with IP router vendors, data center switch providers, and other IT suppliers or integrators. Similarly, as we seek increased customer adoption of our Blue Planet software platform, we expect to compete more directly with additional software vendors and information technology vendors or integrators of these solutions.\nNetwork operators are pursuing a variety of consumption models,\u201d or approaches to the design and procurement of their network infrastructure. While broader adoption of procurement models that emphasize disaggregation of hardware and software remains uncertain, we expect that a diversity of consumption models will require us and other system vendors to broaden our existing offering and commercial models over time. We may face competition from component vendors, including those in our supply chain, that develop networking products based on off-the-shelf or commoditized hardware technology, referred to as white box\u201d hardware. Further, some of our competitors, both large and small, are not vertically integrated in their packet optical supply chain, and sell solutions that rely upon third-party coherent modem technology from merchant modem providers. We may compete with these providers as we pursue merchant modem sales opportunities. We have entered into global distribution relationships to sell our WaveLogic coherent optical technology into this market through Lumentum, NeoPhotonics and Oclaro. Each has the unrestricted ability to sell such optical modules to end users, including our customers, our competitors, and other vendors or network operators that plan to build or use white box\u201d hardware. Accordingly, we may ultimately compete with these partners in the marketplace. In connection with consumption models involving greater disaggregation, the continued use of such third-party modem technology and/or the availability of such technology in the market may increase overall pricing pressure in this space and may negatively impact our ability to derive higher gross margins for Converged Packet Optical solutions.\nSee the Industry Background\u201d and Competition\u201d sections of the description of our business in Item 1 of Part 1 of this annual report for more information related to the competitive landscape of our markets.\nBalance Sheet Initiatives\nShare Repurchase Authorization. On December 7, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $300 million of our outstanding common stock through the end of fiscal 2020. We may purchase shares at management's discretion in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, in transactions structured through investment banking institutions, or a combination of the foregoing. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of shares under this authorization. The amount and timing of repurchases are subject to a variety of factors including liquidity, cash flow, stock price, and general business and market conditions.\nExchange Offer for 2018 Convertible Notes to Add Cash Settlement Conversion Options. On August 2, 2017, we completed an offer to exchange our currently outstanding 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (the Original Notes\u201d) for a new series of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (the New Notes\u201d) and an exchange fee of $2.50 per $1,000 original principal amount. The New Notes give us the option, at our election, to settle conversions of the New Notes for cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares. It is our current intent that upon any conversion of the New Notes we will settle the principal amount thereof in cash. Accordingly, we used the treasury stock method for the New Notes in our diluted earnings per share calculation starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Following settlement of the exchange offer, approximately $61.3 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of Original Notes and $288.7 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of New Notes were outstanding. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for more information relating to our outstanding convertible notes.\nRepurchase and Repayment at Maturity of 0.875% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2017. During fiscal 2017, we repurchased $46.3 million of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 0.875% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2017 (the 2017 Notes\u201d) in private transactions. We repaid in cash the remaining $185.3 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2017 Notes at maturity on June 15, 2017.\nTerm Loan Refinancing. On January 30, 2017, we refinanced our existing term loans in the aggregate principal amount of $250 million, maturing on July 15, 2019 (the \"2019 Term Loan\") and $250 million, maturing on April 25, 2021 (the \"2021 Term Loan\") into a single term loan with an aggregate principal amount of $400 million maturing on January 30, 2022 (the 2022 Term Loan\u201d). The remaining balances under the 2019 Term Loan and 2021 Term Loan were refinanced and replaced by the 2022 Term Loan and the aggregate amount of borrowing was reduced. This arrangement was accounted for as a modification of debt. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for more information relating to our term loan refinancing.\nReversal of Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance\nOur fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2017 results of operations reflect a non-cash $1.1 billion deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversal. See Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for more information relating to this reversal. The value of the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet as of October 31, 2017 would decrease significantly if the U.S. corporate income tax rate is reduced, as proposed in tax reform legislation recently passed by both houses of the U.S. Congress on December 20, 2017. Consequently, if the President signs this proposed legislation into law as expected, we expect that our results of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 would be materially adversely affected by a non-cash charge to reflect the reduction in value of these assets.\nFinancial Results for Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2017 and Sequential Comparison\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $744.4 million, representing a sequential increase of 2.2% from $728.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Revenue-related details reflecting sequential changes from the third quarter of fiscal 2017 include the following:\n \u2022 Product revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 increased by $5.5 million, primarily reflecting an increase of $6.6 million in Networking Platforms partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 million in software platforms within our Software-Related Services segment. \n \u2022 Services revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 increased by $10.2 million. \n \u2022 North America revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $440.5 million, a decrease from $465.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. This primarily reflects decreases of $27.4 million in Networking Platforms and $1.0 million in Software and Software-Related Services. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $3.7 million in Global Services. \n \u2022 Europe, Middle East and Africa (\"EMEA\") revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $110.7 million, an increase from $96.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. This primarily reflects increases of $8.5 million in Networking Platforms and $6.5 million in Global Services. \n \u2022 Caribbean and Latin America ( CALA\u201d) revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $43.5 million, a decrease from $51.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, primarily reflecting a decrease of $9.0 million in Networking Platforms. \n \u2022 Asia Pacific ( APAC\u201d) revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $149.7 million, an increase from $115.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. This reflects an increase of $34.5 million in Networking Platforms partially offset by a decrease of $1.2 million in Global Services. \n \u2022 For the fourth quarter fiscal 2017, AT&T accounted for 16.7% and Verizon accounted for 11.0% of total revenue. AT&T accounted for 16.6% and Verizon accounted for 11.4% of total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. \nGross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was 43.7%, a decrease from 45.0% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The reduced gross margin was primarily due to aggressive efforts to take market share from competitors and secure new customers and the effects of the early stages of these deployments. Our gross margin can fluctuate, particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis, as a result of a number of factors, including the additional costs we incur associated with the early stages of new network deployments that typically include a higher concentration of lower margin common\u201d equipment sales. Part of our strategy for fiscal 2018 is to leverage our technology leadership and to aggressively capture additional market share and displace competitors, particularly with communications service providers internationally. Accordingly, we may encounter fluctuations or reductions in quarterly gross margin during this period.\nOperating expense was $269.9 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, a $23.8 million increase from $246.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. This reflects increases of $9.1 million in selling and marketing expense, primarily due to increased incentive sales compensation and $1.4 million in research and development expenses. Operating expense also reflects a $13.7 million significant asset impairment related to a trade receivable for a single customer in the APAC region. No revenue was recognized from this customer in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and $4.8 million of the impairment was related to revenue recorded during the first nine months of fiscal 2017.\nIncome from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $55.8 million, as compared to $82.0 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Our net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $1.2 billion, or $7.32 per diluted common share which reflects a tax benefit of $1.1 billion related to the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance. This compares to a net income of $60.0 million or $0.39 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nWe generated $138.5 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. This compares with $50.6 million in cash generated from operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. As of October 31, 2017, we had $640.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, $279.1 million of short-term investments in U.S. treasury securities and commercial paper and $49.8 million of long-term investments in U.S. treasury securities. This compares to $559.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, $234.7 million of short-term investments in U.S. treasury securities and commercial paper, and $59.9 million of long-term investments in U.S. treasury securities at July 31, 2017.\nAs of October 31, 2017, we had 5,737 employees, a decrease from 5,780 as of July 31, 2017 and an increase from 5,555 and 5,345 at October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nOperating Segments\nCiena has the following operating segments for reporting purposes: (i) Networking Platforms, (ii) Software and Software-Related Services, and (iii) Global Services. See Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.\nFiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016\nRevenue\nDuring fiscal 2017, approximately 17.4% of our revenue was non-U.S. Dollar denominated, including sales in Euros, Canadian Dollars, Brazilian Reais, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. During fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against these currencies. Consequently, our revenue reported in U.S. Dollars was slightly reduced by approximately $4.9 million, or 0.2%, as compared to fiscal 2016 due to fluctuations in foreign currency. The table below (in thousands, except percentage data) sets forth the changes in our operating segment revenue for the periods indicated:\n\n_________________________________\n\n \u2022 Networking Platforms revenue increased, primarily reflecting product line sales increases of $146.2 million of our Converged Packet Optical products and $60.2 million of our Packet Networking products, partially offset by a product line sales decrease of $22.5 million in our Optical Transport products. \n \u25e6 Converged Packet Optical sales primarily reflect increases of $100.8 million of our Waveserver stackable interconnect system, $61.5 million of our 6500 Packet-Optical Platform, $34.2 million of our 5430 Reconfigurable Switching System and $6.8 million of our OTN configuration for the 5410 Reconfigurable \nSwitching System. These increases were partially offset by sales decreases of $49.9 million of our Z-Series Packet-Optical Platform and $7.4 million of our CoreDirector\u00ae Multiservice Optical Switches.\n \u25e6 Packet Networking sales primarily reflect increases of $38.7 million of our 3000 and 5000 families of service delivery and aggregation switches, $11.9 million in initial sales of packet networking platform independent software and $10.2 million of our 8700 Packetwave Platform. \n \u25e6 Optical Transport sales have continued to experience significant declines, as expected. Our Optical Transport products have either been previously discontinued, or are expected to be discontinued, reflecting network operators' transition toward next-generation converged network architectures addressed by solutions within our Converged Packet Optical product line. Accordingly, commencing in fiscal 2018, sales of Optical Transport will be reflected within the Converged Packet Optical product line of our Networking Platforms segment. \n \u2022 Software and Software-Related Services revenue increased, primarily reflecting sales increases of $19.0 million in software-related services and $17.2 million of our software platforms. The increase in software-related services is primarily due to sales increases of $12.5 million of software subscription services, $4.2 million of services supporting our Blue Planet software platform and advance software applications and $1.5 million of software-enabled services. The increase in software platform sales primarily reflects increases of $9.0 million in sales of our Blue Planet software platform and advanced software applications and $6.5 million in sales of our OneControl Unified Management System. \n \u2022 Global Services revenue decreased, primarily reflecting sales decreases of $13.4 million of our installation and deployment services, $3.9 million of our consulting and network design services and $1.6 million of our maintenance support and training services. These sales decreases were primarily due to reduced activity in the North America and CALA regions as described below.  Our operating segments each engage in business and operations across four geographic regions: North America; EMEA; CALA; and APAC. Results for North America include only activities in the United States and Canada. Part of our business and growth strategy is to continue to diversify our customer base and secure additional service provider customers outside of North America, including in high-growth geographies such as India. We believe that this is an important part of our strategy, and that it is required for continued revenue growth. The following table reflects our geographic distribution of revenue principally based on the relevant location for our delivery of products and performance of services. Our revenue, particularly when considered by geographic distribution, can fluctuate significantly and the timing of revenue recognition for large network projects, particularly outside of North America, can result in large variations in geographic revenue results in any particular quarter. The table below (in thousands, except percentage data) sets forth the changes in geographic distribution of revenue for the periods indicated:\n\n_________________________________\n\n \u2022 North America revenue primarily reflects increases of $34.7 million within our Networking Platforms segment and $25.7 million within our Software and Software-Related Services segment, partially offset by a revenue decrease of $13.6 million within our Global Services segment. \n \u25e6 Networking Platforms revenue primarily reflects product line increases of $29.0 million of Packet Networking sales and $11.5 million of Converged Packet Optical sales, partially offset by a product line decrease of $5.7 million in Optical Transport sales. \n \u25aa The revenue increase within Converged Packet Optical sales primarily reflects increases of $85.7 million in sales of our Waveserver stackable interconnect system, partially offset by decreases in sales of $48.2 million of our Z-Series Packet-Optical Platform, $14.8 million of our 6500 Packet-Optical Platform and $13.3 million of our 5430 Reconfigurable Switching System. The revenue increase for our Waveserver stackable interconnect system primarily reflects increased sales to Web-scale providers. \n \u25aa The revenue increase within Packet Networking primarily reflects increases of $15.5 million in sales of our 3000 and 5000 families of service delivery and aggregation switches and $11.9 million of packet networking platform independent software. Packet Networking sales have traditionally been concentrated, with significant sales to AT&T. However, during fiscal 2017, a significant portion of the growth benefited from sales to other network operators. \n \u25e6 Software and Software-Related Services revenue primarily reflects sales increases of $10.7 million of our software subscription services, $5.3 million of our OneControl Unified Management System, $5.2 million of our Blue Planet software platform and $2.8 million of services supporting our Blue Planet software platform and advance software applications. \n \u25e6 Global Services revenue primarily reflects decreases of $9.0 million for installation and deployment activities and $5.0 million in maintenance support and training. Installation and deployment activities were impacted by the contribution of sales of our Waveserver stackable interconnect system, which does not typically include installation services. \n \u2022 EMEA revenue primarily reflects increases of $5.4 million within our Networking Platforms segment and $5.4 million within our Software and Software-Related Services segment. \n \u25e6 Networking Platforms segment revenue primarily reflects product line increases of $9.7 million in Converged Packet Optical sales and $3.7 million in Packet Networking sales. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in Optical Transport sales. The increase in Converged Packet Optical sales primarily reflects an increase of $10.8 million in sales from our Waveserver stackable interconnect system. \n \u2022 CALA revenue primarily reflects decreases of $22.1 million within our Networking Platforms segment and $8.9 million within our Global Services segment. The decrease in CALA revenue primarily relates to decreased sales to certain communications service providers in Brazil and to AT&T in Mexico. \n \u25e6 Networking Platforms segment revenue primarily reflects product line decreases of $20.4 million of Converged Packet Optical sales and $5.4 million in Optical Transport sales partially offset by a product line increase of $3.7 million of Packet Networking sales. The decrease in Converged Packet Optical sales primarily reflects $15.8 million in sales of our 5430 Reconfigurable Switching System and $3.4 million in sales of our 6500 Packet-Optical Platform. \n \u25e6 Global Services segment revenue primarily reflects reduced installation and deployment activities which reflect the decrease in sales of our Networking Platforms products as described above. \n \u2022 APAC revenue primarily reflects increases of $165.9 million within our Networking Platforms segment, $4.9 million within our Software and Software-Related Services segment and $3.9 million within our Global Services segment. Revenue contribution from India, which increased by $115.5 million in fiscal 2017, was a significant driver of our annual revenue growth. \n \u25e6 Networking Platforms segment revenue primarily reflects product line increases of $145.4 million of Converged Packet Optical sales and $23.9 million of Packet Networking sales, partially offset by a product line decrease of $3.4 million in Optical Transport sales. \n \u25aa Converged Packet Optical revenue primarily reflects an increase of $79.5 million in sales of our 6500 Packet-Optical Platform primarily due to increases in sales through our strategic relationship with Ericsson in Australia, sales to Reliance Jio Infocomm in India and sales to service providers in Japan. The revenue increase within Converged Packet Optical also reflects an increase of $64.3 million of our 5430 Reconfigurable Switching System sales primarily due to increased sales to Reliance Jio Infocomm in India. \n \u25aa Packet Networking revenue primarily reflects increases of $15.9 million in sales of our 3000 and 5000 families of service delivery and aggregation switches and $8.0 million in sales of our 8700 Packetwave Platform primarily to certain communication service providers in India. \nIn fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, our top ten customers contributed 55.6% and 51.1% of revenue, respectively. A sizable portion of our revenue continues to be derived from sales to large service provider customers. Consequently, our financial results are closely correlated with the spending of a relatively small number of customers and can be significantly affected by market, industry or competitive dynamics affecting their businesses. Our reliance upon a relatively small number of customers also increases our exposure to changes in their spending levels, network priorities and purchasing strategies. The loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report.\nOverview\nWe are a network strategy and technology company, providing solutions that enable a wide range of network operators to deploy and manage next-generation communication architectures that deliver a broad array of services. We provide network hardware, software and services that support the transport, switching, aggregation, service delivery and management of video, data, and voice traffic on communications networks. Our high-capacity hardware and network management and control software solutions enable open, programmable networks that enhance automation, reduce network complexity and support changing service requirements. Our solutions create business and operational value for our customers by enabling them to introduce new revenue-generating services and reduce network costs.\nOur solutions include a diverse set of Networking Platform products, which are used by a broad range of network operator customers and market segments, including communications service providers, cable and multiservice operators, Web-scale providers, submarine network operators, governments, enterprises, research and education (R&E) institutions, and other emerging network operators. These products, which can be applied from the network core to network access points, allow network operators to scale capacity, increase transmission speeds, allocate traffic and adapt dynamically to changing end-user service demands. In addition to our portfolio of high-capacity hardware systems and components, we offer network management and domain control software platforms, along with advanced applications software, designed to simplify the creation, automation and delivery of services across multi-vendor and multi-domain network environments. To complement our hardware and software solutions, we offer a broad range of services that help our customers design, optimize, integrate, deploy, manage and maintain their networks.\nOur quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, annual reports on Form 10-K, and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC are available through the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file these documents. We routinely post the reports above, recent news and announcements, financial results and other information about Ciena that is important to investors in the Investors\u201d section of our website at www.ciena.com. Investors are encouraged to review the Investors\u201d section of our website because, as with the other disclosure channels that we use, from time to time we may post material information on that site that is not otherwise disseminated by us.\nMarket Opportunity\nThe markets in which we sell our communications networking solutions have seen significant changes in recent years, including rapid growth in bandwidth demand, proliferation of cloud-based services and heightened end-user service demands. We have also seen the impact of Web-scale network operators and their services on service provider architectures. These conditions have placed significant demands on networks, challenged the business models of network operators, and altered the overall competitive landscape of network operators. Existing and emerging network operators are competing to distinguish their service offerings and rapidly introduce differentiated, revenue-generating services, while managing the costs of their networks and seeking to ensure a profitable business model. We believe that these dynamics, and the need to adapt to rapidly changing business and network demands, will cause network operators to leverage increased software-based network control and programmability, and that network operators will adopt or evolve their infrastructures to be more open, programmable and automated.\nWhile drivers of bandwidth growth and network evolution remain strong, our customers are under constant pressure to constrain their capital expenditure budgets and cannot grow their network spending at the rate of bandwidth growth. As a result, as we innovate and introduce new and more robust solutions that increase capacity or features, there is a market expectation of solutions that are more cost-effective than existing or competing solutions. The combination of this regular technology-driven price compression in our industry and ongoing customer efforts to manage network costs can impact growth rates in our markets, and requires that we increase our volume of product shipments to grow revenue. During fiscal 2017, we saw slower market growth rates in a number of our geographies. Notwithstanding these market dynamics, we grew annual revenue and benefited meaningfully from our continued efforts to diversify our business and to take market share from competitors. Specifically, we continued to diversify our customer base to include additional customer segments, such as Web-scale providers and data center operators and enterprise customers, which contributed to our growth in North America during fiscal 2017. We also benefited from geographic diversification and growth of our business in Asia-Pacific during fiscal 2017,\nincluding sales to additional service provider customers in India. We believe that continued diversification of our business and share capture are important parts of our strategy and necessary for continued revenue growth.\nOur strategy to capitalize on these market dynamics and drive the profitable growth of our business includes the initiatives set forth in the Strategy\u201d section of the description of our business in Item 1 of Part 1 of this annual report.\nCompetitive Landscape\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, frequent introduction of new networking solutions and aggressive selling and pricing efforts to gain or retain market share. The markets for our solutions are both highly competitive and fragmented, as we regularly compete with number of large, multi-national vendors with greater financial, operational and marketing resources, and significantly broader product offerings. Our sales of Converged Packet Optical solutions face an intense competitive environment as we and our competitors introduce new, higher-capacity, higher-speed network solutions with improved reach, spectral efficiency, automation, power consumption and cost per bit. We expect competition in our industry to continue to broaden and to remain challenging and dynamic. As we expand our Packet Networking solutions and our Waveserver DCI platform, our solutions have become increasingly competitive with IP router vendors, data center switch providers, and other IT suppliers or integrators. Similarly, as we seek increased customer adoption of our Blue Planet software platform, we expect to compete more directly with additional software vendors and information technology vendors or integrators of these solutions.\nNetwork operators are pursuing a variety of consumption models,\u201d or approaches to the design and procurement of their network infrastructure. While broader adoption of procurement models that emphasize disaggregation of hardware and software remains uncertain, we expect that a diversity of consumption models will require us and other system vendors to broaden our existing offering and commercial models over time. We may face competition from component vendors, including those in our supply chain, that develop networking products based on off-the-shelf or commoditized hardware technology, referred to as white box\u201d hardware. Further, some of our competitors, both large and small, are not vertically integrated in their packet optical supply chain, and sell solutions that rely upon third-party coherent modem technology from merchant modem providers. We may compete with these providers as we pursue merchant modem sales opportunities. We have entered into global distribution relationships to sell our WaveLogic coherent optical technology into this market through Lumentum, NeoPhotonics and Oclaro. Each has the unrestricted ability to sell such optical modules to end users, including our customers, our competitors, and other vendors or network operators that plan to build or use white box\u201d hardware. Accordingly, we may ultimately compete with these partners in the marketplace. In connection with consumption models involving greater disaggregation, the continued use of such third-party modem technology and/or the availability of such technology in the market may increase overall pricing pressure in this space and may negatively impact our ability to derive higher gross margins for Converged Packet Optical solutions.\nSee the Industry Background\u201d and Competition\u201d sections of the description of our business in Item 1 of Part 1 of this annual report for more information related to the competitive landscape of our markets.\nBalance Sheet Initiatives\nShare Repurchase Authorization. On December 7, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $300 million of our outstanding common stock through the end of fiscal 2020. We may purchase shares at management's discretion in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, in transactions structured through investment banking institutions, or a combination of the foregoing. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of shares under this authorization. The amount and timing of repurchases are subject to a variety of factors including liquidity, cash flow, stock price, and general business and market conditions.\nExchange Offer for 2018 Convertible Notes to Add Cash Settlement Conversion Options. On August 2, 2017, we completed an offer to exchange our currently outstanding 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (the Original Notes\u201d) for a new series of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (the New Notes\u201d) and an exchange fee of $2.50 per $1,000 original principal amount. The New Notes give us the option, at our election, to settle conversions of the New Notes for cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares. It is our current intent that upon any conversion of the New Notes we will settle the principal amount thereof in cash. Accordingly, we used the treasury stock method for the New Notes in our diluted earnings per share calculation starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Following settlement of the exchange offer, approximately $61.3 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of Original Notes and $288.7 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of New Notes were outstanding. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for more information relating to our outstanding convertible notes.\nRepurchase and Repayment at Maturity of 0.875% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2017. During fiscal 2017, we repurchased $46.3 million of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 0.875% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2017 (the 2017 Notes\u201d) in private transactions. We repaid in cash the remaining $185.3 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2017 Notes at maturity on June 15, 2017.\nTerm Loan Refinancing. On January 30, 2017, we refinanced our existing term loans in the aggregate principal amount of $250 million, maturing on July 15, 2019 (the \"2019 Term Loan\") and $250 million, maturing on April 25, 2021 (the \"2021 Term Loan\") into a single term loan with an aggregate principal amount of $400 million maturing on January 30, 2022 (the 2022 Term Loan\u201d). The remaining balances under the 2019 Term Loan and 2021 Term Loan were refinanced and replaced by the 2022 Term Loan and the aggregate amount of borrowing was reduced. This arrangement was accounted for as a modification of debt. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for more information relating to our term loan refinancing.\nReversal of Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance\nOur fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2017 results of operations reflect a non-cash $1.1 billion deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversal. See Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for more information relating to this reversal. The value of the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet as of October 31, 2017 would decrease significantly if the U.S. corporate income tax rate is reduced, as proposed in tax reform legislation recently passed by both houses of the U.S. Congress on December 20, 2017. Consequently, if the President signs this proposed legislation into law as expected, we expect that our results of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 would be materially adversely affected by a non-cash charge to reflect the reduction in value of these assets.\nFinancial Results for Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2017 and Sequential Comparison\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $744.4 million, representing a sequential increase of 2.2% from $728.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Revenue-related details reflecting sequential changes from the third quarter of fiscal 2017 include the following:\n \u2022 Product revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 increased by $5.5 million, primarily reflecting an increase of $6.6 million in Networking Platforms partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 million in software platforms within our Software-Related Services segment. \n \u2022 Services revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 increased by $10.2 million. \n \u2022 North America revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $440.5 million, a decrease from $465.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. This primarily reflects decreases of $27.4 million in Networking Platforms and $1.0 million in Software and Software-Related Services. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $3.7 million in Global Services. \n \u2022 Europe, Middle East and Africa (\"EMEA\") revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $110.7 million, an increase from $96.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. This primarily reflects increases of $8.5 million in Networking Platforms and $6.5 million in Global Services. \n \u2022 Caribbean and Latin America ( CALA\u201d) revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $43.5 million, a decrease from $51.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, primarily reflecting a decrease of $9.0 million in Networking Platforms. \n \u2022 Asia Pacific ( APAC\u201d) revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $149.7 million, an increase from $115.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. This reflects an increase of $34.5 million in Networking Platforms partially offset by a decrease of $1.2 million in Global Services. \n \u2022 For the fourth quarter fiscal 2017, AT&T accounted for 16.7% and Verizon accounted for 11.0% of total revenue. AT&T accounted for 16.6% and Verizon accounted for 11.4% of total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. \nGross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was 43.7%, a decrease from 45.0% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The reduced gross margin was primarily due to aggressive efforts to take market share from competitors and secure new customers and the effects of the early stages of these deployments. Our gross margin can fluctuate, particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis, as a result of a number of factors, including the additional costs we incur associated with the early stages of new network deployments that typically include a higher concentration of lower margin common\u201d equipment sales. Part of our strategy for fiscal 2018 is to leverage our technology leadership and to aggressively capture additional market share and displace competitors, particularly with communications service providers internationally. Accordingly, we may encounter fluctuations or reductions in quarterly gross margin during this period.\nOperating expense was $269.9 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, a $23.8 million increase from $246.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. This reflects increases of $9.1 million in selling and marketing expense, primarily due to increased incentive sales compensation and $1.4 million in research and development expenses. Operating expense also reflects a $13.7 million significant asset impairment related to a trade receivable for a single customer in the APAC region. No revenue was recognized from this customer in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and $4.8 million of the impairment was related to revenue recorded during the first nine months of fiscal 2017.\nIncome from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $55.8 million, as compared to $82.0 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Our net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $1.2 billion, or $7.32 per diluted common share which reflects a tax benefit of $1.1 billion related to the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance. This compares to a net income of $60.0 million or $0.39 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nWe generated $138.5 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. This compares with $50.6 million in cash generated from operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. As of October 31, 2017, we had $640.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, $279.1 million of short-term investments in U.S. treasury securities and commercial paper and $49.8 million of long-term investments in U.S. treasury securities. This compares to $559.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, $234.7 million of short-term investments in U.S. treasury securities and commercial paper, and $59.9 million of long-term investments in U.S. treasury securities at July 31, 2017.\nAs of October 31, 2017, we had 5,737 employees, a decrease from 5,780 as of July 31, 2017 and an increase from 5,555 and 5,345 at October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nOperating Segments\nCiena has the following operating segments for reporting purposes: (i) Networking Platforms, (ii) Software and Software-Related Services, and (iii) Global Services. See Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.\nFiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016\nRevenue\nDuring fiscal 2017, approximately 17.4% of our revenue was non-U.S. Dollar denominated, including sales in Euros, Canadian Dollars, Brazilian Reais, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. During fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against these currencies. Consequently, our revenue reported in U.S. Dollars was slightly reduced by approximately $4.9 million, or 0.2%, as compared to fiscal 2016 due to fluctuations in foreign currency. The table below (in thousands, except percentage data) sets forth the changes in our operating segment revenue for the periods indicated:\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

Networking Platforms revenue increased, primarily reflecting product line sales increases of $146.2 million of our Converged Packet Optical products and $60.2 million of our Packet Networking products, partially offset by a product line sales decrease of $22.5 million in our Optical Transport products. \n \u25e6 Converged Packet Optical sales primarily reflect increases of $100.8 million of our Waveserver stackable interconnect system, $61.5 million of our 6500 Packet-Optical Platform, $34.2 million of our 5430 Reconfigurable Switching System and $6.8 million of our OTN configuration for the 5410 Reconfigurable \nSwitching System. These increases were partially offset by sales decreases of $49.9 million of our Z-Series Packet-Optical Platform and $7.4 million of our CoreDirector\u00ae Multiservice Optical Switches.\n \u25e6 Packet Networking sales primarily reflect increases of $38.7 million of our 3000 and 5000 families of service delivery and aggregation switches, $11.9 million in initial sales of packet networking platform independent software and $10.2 million of our 8700 Packetwave Platform. \n \u25e6 Optical Transport sales have continued to experience significant declines, as expected. Our Optical Transport products have either been previously discontinued, or are expected to be discontinued, reflecting network operators' transition toward next-generation converged network architectures addressed by solutions within our Converged Packet Optical product line. Accordingly, commencing in fiscal 2018, sales of Optical Transport will be reflected within the Converged Packet Optical product line of our Networking Platforms segment. \n \u2022 Software and Software-Related Services revenue increased, primarily reflecting sales increases of $19.0 million in software-related services and $17.2 million of our software platforms. The increase in software-related services is primarily due to sales increases of $12.5 million of software subscription services, $4.2 million of services supporting our Blue Planet software platform and advance software applications and $1.5 million of software-enabled services. The increase in software platform sales primarily reflects increases of $9.0 million in sales of our Blue Planet software platform and advanced software applications and $6.5 million in sales of our OneControl Unified Management System. \n \u2022 Global Services revenue decreased, primarily reflecting sales decreases of $13.4 million of our installation and deployment services, $3.9 million of our consulting and network design services and $1.6 million of our maintenance support and training services. These sales decreases were primarily due to reduced activity in the North America and CALA regions as described below.  Our operating segments each engage in business and operations across four geographic regions: North America; EMEA; CALA; and APAC. Results for North America include only activities in the United States and Canada. Part of our business and growth strategy is to continue to diversify our customer base and secure additional service provider customers outside of North America, including in high-growth geographies such as India. We believe that this is an important part of our strategy, and that it is required for continued revenue growth. The following table reflects our geographic distribution of revenue principally based on the relevant location for our delivery of products and performance of services. Our revenue, particularly when considered by geographic distribution, can fluctuate significantly and the timing of revenue recognition for large network projects, particularly outside of North America, can result in large variations in geographic revenue results in any particular quarter. The table below (in thousands, except percentage data) sets forth the changes in geographic distribution of revenue for the periods indicated:\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%**\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,736,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,689,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA\n</td> <td>404,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>393,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CALA\n</td> <td>164,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,777\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>APAC\n</td> <td>497,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>322,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>174,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,801,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,600,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>201,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________________\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*\n</td> <td>Denotes % of total revenue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>**\n</td> <td>Denotes % change from 2016 to 2017\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 North America revenue primarily reflects increases of $34.7 million within our Networking Platforms segment and $25.7 million within our Software and Software-Related Services segment, partially offset by a revenue decrease of $13.6 million within our Global Services segment. \n \u25e6 Networking Platforms revenue primarily reflects product line increases of $29.0 million of Packet Networking sales and $11.5 million of Converged Packet Optical sales, partially offset by a product line decrease of $5.7 million in Optical Transport sales. \n \u25aa The revenue increase within Converged Packet Optical sales primarily reflects increases of $85.7 million in sales of our Waveserver stackable interconnect system, partially offset by decreases in sales of $48.2 million of our Z-Series Packet-Optical Platform, $14.8 million of our 6500 Packet-Optical Platform and $13.3 million of our 5430 Reconfigurable Switching System. The revenue increase for our Waveserver stackable interconnect system primarily reflects increased sales to Web-scale providers. \n \u25aa The revenue increase within Packet Networking primarily reflects increases of $15.5 million in sales of our 3000 and 5000 families of service delivery and aggregation switches and $11.9 million of packet networking platform independent software. Packet Networking sales have traditionally been concentrated, with significant sales to AT&T. However, during fiscal 2017, a significant portion of the growth benefited from sales to other network operators. \n \u25e6 Software and Software-Related Services revenue primarily reflects sales increases of $10.7 million of our software subscription services, $5.3 million of our OneControl Unified Management System, $5.2 million of our Blue Planet software platform and $2.8 million of services supporting our Blue Planet software platform and advance software applications. \n \u25e6 Global Services revenue primarily reflects decreases of $9.0 million for installation and deployment activities and $5.0 million in maintenance support and training. Installation and deployment activities were impacted by the contribution of sales of our Waveserver stackable interconnect system, which does not typically include installation services. \n \u2022 EMEA revenue primarily reflects increases of $5.4 million within our Networking Platforms segment and $5.4 million within our Software and Software-Related Services segment. \n \u25e6 Networking Platforms segment revenue primarily reflects product line increases of $9.7 million in Converged Packet Optical sales and $3.7 million in Packet Networking sales. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in Optical Transport sales. The increase in Converged Packet Optical sales primarily reflects an increase of $10.8 million in sales from our Waveserver stackable interconnect system. \n \u2022 CALA revenue primarily reflects decreases of $22.1 million within our Networking Platforms segment and $8.9 million within our Global Services segment. The decrease in CALA revenue primarily relates to decreased sales to certain communications service providers in Brazil and to AT&T in Mexico. \n \u25e6 Networking Platforms segment revenue primarily reflects product line decreases of $20.4 million of Converged Packet Optical sales and $5.4 million in Optical Transport sales partially offset by a product line increase of $3.7 million of Packet Networking sales. The decrease in Converged Packet Optical sales primarily reflects $15.8 million in sales of our 5430 Reconfigurable Switching System and $3.4 million in sales of our 6500 Packet-Optical Platform. \n \u25e6 Global Services segment revenue primarily reflects reduced installation and deployment activities which reflect the decrease in sales of our Networking Platforms products as described above. \n \u2022 APAC revenue primarily reflects increases of $165.9 million within our Networking Platforms segment, $4.9 million within our Software and Software-Related Services segment and $3.9 million within our Global Services segment. Revenue contribution from India, which increased by $115.5 million in fiscal 2017, was a significant driver of our annual revenue growth. \n \u25e6 Networking Platforms segment revenue primarily reflects product line increases of $145.4 million of Converged Packet Optical sales and $23.9 million of Packet Networking sales, partially offset by a product line decrease of $3.4 million in Optical Transport sales. \n \u25aa Converged Packet Optical revenue primarily reflects an increase of $79.5 million in sales of our 6500 Packet-Optical Platform primarily due to increases in sales through our strategic relationship with Ericsson in Australia, sales to Reliance Jio Infocomm in India and sales to service providers in Japan. The revenue increase within Converged Packet Optical also reflects an increase of $64.3 million of our 5430 Reconfigurable Switching System sales primarily due to increased sales to Reliance Jio Infocomm in India. \n \u25aa Packet Networking revenue primarily reflects increases of $15.9 million in sales of our 3000 and 5000 families of service delivery and aggregation switches and $8.0 million in sales of our 8700 Packetwave Platform primarily to certain communication service providers in India. \nIn fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, our top ten customers contributed 55.6% and 51.1% of revenue, respectively. A sizable portion of our revenue continues to be derived from sales to large service provider customers. Consequently, our financial results are closely correlated with the spending of a relatively small number of customers and can be significantly affected by market, industry or competitive dynamics affecting their businesses. Our reliance upon a relatively small number of customers also increases our exposure to changes in their spending levels, network priorities and purchasing strategies. The loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect"}
