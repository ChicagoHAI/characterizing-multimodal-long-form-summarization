MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nThe Parking REIT, Inc., formerly known as MVP REIT II, Inc., is a Maryland corporation formed on May 4, 2015 and intends to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the filing of the federal tax return for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company believes that it has been organized and has operated in a manner that has enabled it to qualify as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 2017; however, if the Company is unable to meet the REIT qualification for 2017, the Company will continue to operate as a C corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2016, the Company ceased all selling efforts for the Common Stock Offering of its common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, at $25.00 per share, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 (No. 333-205893) filed with the SEC under the Securities Act. The Company accepted additional subscriptions through March 31, 2017, the last day of the Common Stock Offering.\nOn October 27, 2016, the Company filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland Articles Supplementary to the charter of the Company classifying and designating 50,000 shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. The Company commenced the private placement of the shares of Series A, together with warrants to acquire the Company's common stock, to accredited investors on November 1, 2016 and closed the offering on March 24, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the Company raised approximately $2.7 million, net of offering costs, in the Series A private placements and has 2,862 shares of Series A issued and outstanding.\nOn March 29, 2017, the Company filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland Articles Supplementary to the charter of the Company classifying and designating 97,000 shares of its authorized capital stock as shares of Series 1 Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (\"Series 1\"), par value $0.0001 per share. On April 7, 2017, the Company commenced the private placement of shares of Series 1, together with warrants to acquire the Company's common stock, to accredited investors. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had raised gross proceeds of approximately $27.4 million, net of offering costs, in the Series 1 private placements and had 29,789 shares of Series 1 issued and outstanding. On January 31, 2018, the Company closed the Series 1 offering.\nThe Company was formed to focus primarily on investments in parking facilities, including parking lots, parking garages and other parking structures throughout the United States and Canada. No more than 10% of the proceeds of the Common Stock Offering will be used for investment in Canadian properties. The Company currently has no investments in Canada. To a lesser extent, the Company may also invest in properties other than parking facilities.\nThe Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. The Company intends to own substantially all of its assets and conduct its operations through the Operating Partnership. The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, MVP REIT II Holdings, LLC, is the sole limited partner of the Operating Partnership. The operating agreement provides that the Operating Partnership is operated in a manner that enables the Company to (1) satisfy the requirements for being classified as a REIT for tax purposes, (2) avoid any federal income or excise tax liability and (3) ensure that the Operating Partnership is not classified as a \"publicly traded partnership\" for purposes of Section 7704 of the Code, which classification could result in the Operating Partnership being taxed as a corporation.\nThe Company utilizes an UPREIT structure to enable the Company to acquire real property in exchange for limited partnership interests in the Company's Operating Partnership from owners who desire to defer taxable gain that would otherwise normally be recognized by them upon the disposition of their real property or transfer of their real property to the Company in exchange for shares of the Company's common stock or cash.\nAs part of the Company's initial capitalization, 8,000 shares of common stock were sold for $200,000 to the Sponsor. The Sponsor is owned 60% by VRM II and 40% by VRM I, which were both managed by Vestin Mortgage prior to being internalized in January 2018.\nThe Company's Advisor is owned 60% by VRM II and 40% by VRM I. The Advisor is responsible for managing the Company's affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying and making investments on the Company's behalf pursuant to the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement. As of June 21, 2018, the Company had no paid employees.\nThe following table is a summary of the acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2017:\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> Property\n</td> <td> Location\n</td> <td> Date Acquired\n</td> <td> Property Type\n</td> <td> # Spaces\n</td> <td> Size / Acreage\n</td> <td> Retail Sq.

The remaining 49% of the equity portion was funded through short-term investments by the Advisor, which were then later sold to unrelated third parties in the private placement of beneficial interest in MVP St. Louis DST.\nDuring February 2018, the Company, through MVP New Orleans Rampart, LLC (\"MVP New Orleans\"), an entity owned by the Company, closed on the purchase of a parking lot consisting of approximately 78 parking spaces, located in New Orleans, Louisiana, for the purchase price of $8.0 million plus closing costs. The parking lot will be operated by 342 N. Rampart, LLC.\nThe Company believes that it operated in a manner necessary for qualification as a REIT for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company is neither a mutual fund nor an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act nor subject to any regulation thereunder. As a REIT, the Company is required to have a December 31 fiscal year end. As a REIT, the Company will generally not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of its REIT taxable income that is distributed to stockholders. Among other requirements, REITs are required to satisfy certain gross income and asset tests, which may affect the composition of assets the Company acquires with the proceeds of the Common Stock Offering. In addition, REITs are required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of their annual REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain).\nIf the Company does not qualify as a REIT for the tax year ended December 31, 2017, the Company will continue to file as a C corporation, and deferred tax assets and liabilities will be established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets is provided if we believe that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the tax benefit of deferred tax assets based on the available evidence at the time the determination is made. For the tax year ended December 31, 2017, the Company concluded that, due to our cumulative book losses, a valuation allowance should be recorded against our net deferred tax assets.\nThe Company's board of directors will at all times have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over the Company, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to the Company's Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, however, the Company's board of directors has delegated to the Advisor the authority to manage the Company's day-to-day business, in accordance with the Company's investment objectives, strategy, guidelines, policies and limitations. VRM II owns 60% of the Advisor, and the remaining 40% is owned by VRM I; both were managed by Vestin Mortgage until such entity was internalized in January 2018. The Company's Sponsor is owned 60% by VRM II and 40% by VRM I, which were both managed by Vestin Mortgage prior to being internalized in January 2018. The Company also sold 5,000 shares of common stock directly to VRM II.\nVRM I and VRM II are engaged primarily in the business of investing in commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate. As the owners of the Advisor, VRM I and VRM II may benefit from any fees and other compensation that the Company pays to the Advisor under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement. In this regard, the Company notes that the Advisor has agreed to waive certain fees and expenses it otherwise would be entitled under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement. Please refer to Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements - Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection With the Operations of the Company in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report for more information. If the owners of the Advisor determine that such waivers are no longer in the best interests of their stockholders or otherwise refuse to grant future waivers of fees or expenses if requested by the Company, then the Company's operating expenses could increase significantly, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and the amount of distributions to stockholders.\nIn addition, the Company may compete against VRM I and VRM II, both of which are managed by affiliates of the Company's Sponsor, for the acquisition of investments. The Company believes this potential conflict is mitigated, in part, by the Company's focus on parking facilities as its core investments, while the investment strategy of VRM I and VRM II focuses on acquiring office buildings and other commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate.\nFor additional discussion regarding potential conflicts of interests, please see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest\" and \"Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\" in this Annual Report.\nIn October 2016, the board of directors appointed a special committee to evaluate liquidity options. After consideration, in January 2017, the special committee of the board of directors decided to explore a merger with MVP I.\nOn May 26, 2017, the Company, MVI I, Merger Sub and the Advisor entered into the Merger Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, MVP I merged with and into Merger Sub on December 15, 2017, with Merger Sub surviving the Merger such that following the Merger, Merger Sub continued as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger is intended to qualify as a \"reorganization\" under, and within the meaning of, Section 368(a) of the Code. The combined company was subsequently renamed \"The Parking REIT, Inc.\"\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of MVP I Common Stock was automatically cancelled and retired, and converted into the right to receive 0.365 shares of common stock of the Company. Holders of shares of MVP I Common Stock received cash in lieu of fractional shares.\nAt the effective time of the Merger, each share of MVP I Common Stock, if any, then held by any wholly owned subsidiary of MVP I or by the Company or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries became no longer outstanding and was automatically retired and ceased to exist, and no consideration was paid, nor will any other payment or right inure or be made with respect to such shares of MVP I Common Stock in connection with or as a consequence of the Merger. In addition, each share of MVP I's Non-Participating, Non-Voting Convertible Stock, $0.001 par value per share (\"MVP I Convertible Stock\"), all 1,000 of which were held by the Advisor, were automatically retired and ceased to exist, and no consideration was paid, nor will any other payment or right inure or be made with respect to such shares of MVP I Convertible Stock in connection with or as a consequence of the Merger.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company's board of directors increased the number of directors to eight from five prior to the Merger, and Nicholas Nilsen, Robert J. Aalberts and Shawn Nelson, previous directors of MVP I, were elected to the board of directors.\nAmended and Restated Advisory Agreement\nConcurrently with the entry into the Merger Agreement, on May 26, 2017, the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Advisor entered into the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, which became effective at the effective time of the Merger. The Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions upon which we appoint the Advisor to serve as our advisor. The Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement amended the Company's existing advisory agreement, dated October 5, 2015, to provide for, among other amendments, (i) elimination of acquisition fees, disposition fees and subordinated performance fees and (ii) the payment of an asset management fee by the Company to the Advisor calculated and paid monthly in an amount equal to one-twelfth of 1.1% of the (a) cost of each asset then held by the Company, without deduction for depreciation, bad debts or other non-cash reserves, or (b) the Company's proportionate share thereof in the case of an investment made through a joint venture or other co-ownership arrangement excluding (only for clause (b)) debt financing on the investment. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, the asset management fee may not exceed the Asset Management Fee Cap until the earlier of such time, if ever, that (i) the Company holds assets with an Appraised Value (as defined Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement) equal to or in excess of $500,000,000 or (ii) the Company reports AFFO (as defined in the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement) equal to or greater than $0.3125 per share of Company Common Stock (an amount intended to reflect a 5% or greater annualized return on $25.00 per share of the Company's common stock) (the \"Per Share Amount\") for two consecutive quarters, on a fully diluted basis. All amounts of the asset management fee in excess of the Asset Management Fee Cap, plus interest thereon at a rate of 3.5% per annum, will be due and payable by the Company no later than ninety (90) days after the earlier of the date that (i) the Company holds assets with an Appraised Value equal to or in excess of $500,000,000 or (ii) the Company reports AFFO per share of the Company's common stock equal to or greater than the Per Share Amount for two consecutive quarters, on a fully diluted basis.\nIn addition, the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement contains customary indemnification provisions for the Advisor and its affiliates for all liabilities, claims, damages or losses arising in the performance of their duties under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, as well as related expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees. Further, in the event that the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement is terminated for any reason, the Company is prohibited under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement from directly or indirectly soliciting or hiring the employees of the Advisor or any of its affiliates for one year after such termination, and the Company may need to pay the Advisor significant amounts to waive such prohibition. The Company is also prohibited from intentionally interfering with, or enticing away, the relationship of the Advisor or its affiliates with any person who, during the term of the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement or the preceding one-year period, was a tenant, co-investor, co-developer, joint venture or other customer of the Advisor or its affiliates. The Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement have an initial term of one year from the effective date, and may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive one-year terms upon the parties' mutual consent.\nTermination Agreement\nConcurrently with the entry into the Merger Agreement, on May 26, 2017, the Company, MVP I, the Advisor and the Operating Partnership entered into a termination and fee agreement (the \"Termination Agreement\"). Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, the Advisory Agreement, dated September 25, 2012, as amended, among MVP I and the Advisor was terminated, and the Company paid the Advisor an Advisor Acquisition Payment (as such term is defined in the Termination Agreement) of approximately $3.6 million, which was the only fee payable to the Advisor in connection with the Merger.\nThe foregoing description of the Merger Agreement, the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement and the Termination Agreement is only a summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the applicable agreements, each of which is filed with as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 31, 2017.\nAmended Charter\nIn connection with the Merger, at the Company's annual stockholders' meeting held on September 27, 2017, the Company's stockholders approved, among other matters, the amendment and restatement of its charter (the \"Amended Charter\"). As described in more detail in the final proxy statement distributed to our stockholders for the annual meeting, the Amended Charter is primarily intended to accomplish two objectives in connection with the possible listing of the Company's common stock after the closing of the Merger: (1) to remove provisions of our charter that the Company believes may unnecessarily restrict our ability to take advantage of further opportunities for liquidity events or are redundant with or otherwise addressed or permitted to be addressed under Maryland law and (2) to amend certain provisions in a manner that the Company believes would be more suitable for becoming a publicly-traded REIT.\nThe Amended Charter will become effective upon its filing with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland. The Company expects to file the proposed Amended Charter immediately before the Company's common stock becomes listed for trading on a national securities exchange. This means that the changes to the charter will not be effective unless and until we complete an exchange listing.\nReview of the Company's Policies\nThe Company's board of directors, including the independent directors, have reviewed the policies described in this Annual Report and determined that they are in the best interest of the Company's stockholders because: (1) they increase the likelihood that the Company will be able to acquire a diversified portfolio of income producing properties, thereby reducing risk in its portfolio; (2) the Company's executive officers, directors and affiliates of the Advisor have expertise with the type of real estate investments the Company seeks; and (3) borrowings should enable the Company to purchase assets and earn rental income more quickly, thereby increasing the likelihood of generating income for the Company's stockholders and preserving stockholder capital.\nResults of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe Company began purchasing properties in May 2016 and the results of operations below reflect start-up costs as well as acquisition expenses incurred in connection with purchasing properties as the Company seeks to deploy the Company's proceeds from the Common Stock Offering. The Company expects that income and expenses related to the Company's portfolio will increase in future years as a result of owning the properties acquired for a full year and as a result of anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related assets. The results of operations described below may not be indicative of future results of operations.\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Parking base rent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,603,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 82.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,091,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 68.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retail rent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 91,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Management Agreement (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 518,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 503,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 31.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage rent (b)(c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,173,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,385,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,602,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> a)\n</td> <td> During January 2017, MVP Detroit Center Garage, LLC (\"MVP Detroit\") received a settlement amount from the previous operator of approximately $408,000 for the operations of the garage until SP+ assumed operations under a longer-term lease agreement.

All of the properties held as of December 31, 2016 were purchased in May 2016 or later, not providing a full twelve months' worth of rental income in 2016. The increase in rental revenues and the number of properties held is a result of the Company's planned and continued growth through acquisitions of new properties and the Merger of the Company and MVP I. In particular, the acquisition of the $55.0 million garage in Detroit, which accounted for a large portion of the increase, generating approximately $4.7 million in rental income to the Company during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company expects to see a substantial increase in revenue related to the 25 consolidated parking facilities that were acquired through the Merger with MVP I on December 15, 2017. As the Company continues to acquire new properties, by means of equity raises and debt financing, we expect to see our rental revenue to continue to grow year over year. Approximately $0.4 million in revenue was recorded related to the merged assets for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFor additional information see Note I - Acquisitions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report.\nDuring the last week of August 2017, Houston, Texas experienced major flooding due to Hurricane Harvey. This resulted in limited access to the Houston area and a shutdown of most business and government operations. Our parking garage and parking lots located in Houston, Texas experienced minimal damage during this time and experienced no loss in base rental income.\nSince a majority of the Company's property leases call for additional percentage rent, the Company monitors the gross revenue generated by each property on a monthly basis. The higher the property's gross revenue the higher the Company's potential percentage rent. The graph below shows the comparison of the Company's monthly rental income to the gross revenue generated by the properties.\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 677,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property operating expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 981,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 395,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset management expense-related party\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,259,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 197,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,897,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,049,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Merger costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,216,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,695,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,472,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition expenses - related party\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,957,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,229,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Seminar\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,036,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 195,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,718,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,618,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by approximately $12.1 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. A significant portion of this increase ($6.2 million) was attributable to costs relating to the Merger. The balance of the increase in expenses is primarily attributable to the Company's growth in investments in parking facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company acquired a controlling interest in five parking facilities, unrelated to the Merger, totaling approximately $92.2 million, as compared to 12 properties totaling approximately $54.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in acquisitions resulted in increased property taxes, other property operating expense, asset management fees, acquisitions expenses and depreciation. As the Company continues to acquire new properties, by means of the equity raises and debt financing, we expect to see our operations and maintenance and depreciation expenses grow.\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,651,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (154,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Distribution income - related party\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 189,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 34,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain from sale of investment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,200,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain from acquisition of real estate-equity method\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 180,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from assets held for sale\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (19,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from DST\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 105,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from investment in equity method investee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,958,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (136,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016, is related to the Company's increased use of debt to acquire properties. To maximize the use of our cash, the Company will continue to look for opportunities to utilize financing on future acquisitions, including with the use of our line of credit with KeyBank or permanent debt at the time of acquisitions. The interest expense will vary based on the amount of our borrowings and current interest rates at the time of financing. The Company will seek to secure appropriate leverage with the lowest interest rate available to us. The terms of the loans will greatly depend on the quality of the property, the credit worthiness of the tenant and the amount of income the property is able to generate through our parking leases. There is no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms or at all. Interest expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes loan amortization costs. Total loan amortization cost for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $1.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively.\nFor additional information see Note J - Line of Credit and Note K - Notes Payable in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report.\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nThe Advisor believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Additionally, publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, the Company believes that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases.\nIn order to provide a more complete understanding of the operating performance of a REIT, NAREIT promulgated a measure known as FFO. FFO is defined as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property, adding back asset impairment write-downs, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets), and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Because FFO calculations exclude such items as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. As a result, the Company believes that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of the Company's performance relative to the Company's competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. It should be noted, however, that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than the Company does, making comparisons less meaningful.\nThe Investment Program Association (\"IPA\") issued Practice Guideline 2010-01 (the \"IPA MFFO Guideline\") on November 2, 2010, which extended financial measures to include modified funds from operations (\"MFFO\"). In computing MFFO, FFO is adjusted for certain non-operating cash items such as acquisition fees and expenses and certain non-cash items such as straight-line rent, amortization of in-place lease valuations, amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments, nonrecurring impairments of real estate-related investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (loss), and nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. Management is responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk. To achieve the Company's objectives, the Company may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates. In order to mitigate the Company's interest rate risk on certain financial instruments, if any, the Company may enter into interest rate cap agreements and in order to mitigate the Company's risk to foreign currency exposure, if any, the Company may enter into foreign currency hedges. The Company views fair value adjustments of derivatives, impairment charges and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as non-recurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized, and which are not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance. Additionally, the Company believes it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations, assessments regarding general market conditions, and the specific performance of properties owned, which can change over time.\nNo less frequently than annually, the Company evaluates events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the Company assesses whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted operating cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) expected from the use of the assets and the eventual disposition. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of MFFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the relatively limited term of the Company's operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through operational net revenues or cash flows prior to any liquidity event. The Company adopted the IPA MFFO Guideline as management believes that MFFO is a helpful indicator of the Company's on-going portfolio performance. More specifically, MFFO isolates the financial results of the REIT's operations. MFFO, however, is not considered an appropriate measure of historical earnings as it excludes certain significant costs that are otherwise included in reported earnings. Further, since the measure is based on historical financial information, MFFO for the period presented may not be indicative of future results or the Company's future ability to pay the Company's dividends. By providing FFO and MFFO, the Company presents information that assists investors in aligning their analysis with management's analysis of long-term operating activities. MFFO also allows for a comparison of the performance of the Company's portfolio with other REITs that are not currently engaging in acquisitions, as well as a comparison of the Company's performance with that of other non-traded REITs, as MFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by non-traded REITs, and the Company believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes. As explained below, management's evaluation of the Company's operating performance excludes items considered in the calculation of MFFO based on the following economic considerations:\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Straight-line rent. Most of the Company's leases provide for periodic minimum rent payment increases throughout the term of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, these periodic minimum rent payment increases during the term of a lease are recorded to rental revenue on a straight-line basis in order to reconcile the difference between accrual and cash basis accounting. As straight-line rent is a GAAP non-cash adjustment and is included in historical earnings, it is added back to FFO to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of the Company's portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Amortization of in-place lease valuation. As this item is a cash flow adjustment made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, it is added back to FFO to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of the Company's portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Acquisition-related costs. The Company was organized primarily with the purpose of acquiring or investing in income-producing real property in order to generate operational income and cash flow that will allow us to provide regular cash distributions to the Company's stockholders. In the process, the Company incurs non-reimbursable affiliated and non-affiliated acquisition-related costs, which in accordance with GAAP, are expensed as incurred and are included in the determination of income (loss) from operations and net income (loss). These costs have been and will continue to be funded with cash proceeds from the Offering or included as a component of the amount borrowed to acquire such real estate. If the Company acquires a property after all offering proceeds from the Offering have been invested, there will not be any offering proceeds to pay the corresponding acquisition-related costs. Accordingly, unless the Advisor determines to waive the payment of any then-outstanding acquisition-related costs otherwise payable to the Advisor, such costs will be paid from additional debt, operational earnings or cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or ancillary cash flows. In evaluating the performance of the Company's portfolio over time, management employs business models and analyses that differentiate the costs to acquire investments from the investments' revenues and expenses. Acquisition-related costs may negatively affect the Company's operating results, cash flows from operating activities and cash available to fund distributions during periods in which properties are acquired, as the proceeds to fund these costs would otherwise be invested in other real estate related assets. By excluding acquisition-related costs, MFFO may not provide an accurate indicator of the Company's operating performance during periods in which acquisitions are made. However, it can provide an indication of the Company's on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern after the Company ceases to acquire properties on a frequent and regular basis, which can be compared to the MFFO of other non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have similar operating characteristics to the Company. Management believes that excluding these costs from MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analysis used by management.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor all of these reasons, the Company believes the non-GAAP measures of FFO and MFFO, in addition to income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) and cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful to investors in evaluating the performance of the Company's real estate portfolio. However, a material limitation associated with FFO and MFFO is that they are not indicative of the Company's cash available to fund distributions since other uses of cash, such as capital expenditures at the Company's properties and principal payments of debt, are not deducted when calculating FFO and MFFO. Additionally, MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as the Company's where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value. The use of MFFO as a measure of long-term operating performance on value is also limited if the Company does not continue to operate under the Company's current business plan as noted above. MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the Company's ongoing ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern in future operating periods, and in particular, after the Common Stock Offering and acquisition stages are complete and NAV is disclosed. However, MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating NAV because impairments are taken into account in determining NAV but not in determining MFFO. Therefore, FFO and MFFO should not be viewed as more prominent a measure of performance than income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) or to cash flows from operating activities and each should be reviewed in connection with GAAP measurements.\nNone of the SEC, NAREIT or any other organization has opined on the acceptability of the adjustments contemplated to adjust FFO in order to calculate MFFO and its use as a non-GAAP performance measure. In the future, the SEC or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable exclusions across the REIT industry, and the Company may have to adjust the calculation and characterization of this non-GAAP measure.\nThe Company's calculation of FFO and MFFO attributable to shareholders is presented in the following table for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss attributable to The Parking REIT, Inc. common shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,751,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,268,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add (Subtract):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on Sale of real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,200,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and Amortization of real estate assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,036,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 195,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9,915,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,073,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition fees and expenses to non-affiliates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,695,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,472,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition fees and expenses to affiliates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,957,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,229,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition / Merger costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,216,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MFFO attributable to The Parking REIT, Inc. shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 953,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (372,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Distributions paid to Common Shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,296,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 732,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company commenced operations on December 30, 2015.\nThe Company's principal demand for funds is for the acquisition of real estate assets, the payment of operating expenses, capital expenditures, interest on the Company's outstanding indebtedness and the payment of distributions to the Company's stockholders. Over time, the Company intends to generally fund its operating expenses from its cash flow from operations. The cash required for acquisitions and investments in real estate is funded primarily from the sale of shares of the Company's preferred stock and common stock, including those offered for sale through the Company's distribution reinvestment plan, dispositions of properties in the Company's portfolio and through third party financing and the assumption of debt on acquired properties.\nThe Company may seek to raise additional funds through equity financings, such as private placements of its preferred stock, as well as through additional debt financing. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had raised approximately $2.7 million in funds from the private placements of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock and approximately $27.4 million in funds from the private placements of Series 1 Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. The Company continued to raise additional funds through private placements of Series 1 Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock until January 31, 2018, at which time the Preferred Series 1 offering was closed.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's debt consisted of approximately $123.8 million in fixed rate debt and $22.3 million in variable rate debt, net of loan issuance costs.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled approximately $16.6 million. Operating cash flows were used for the payment of normal operating expenses such as management fees, insurance, accounting fees and legal bills. Net cash used in investing activities totaled approximately $88.4 million and mainly consisted of purchase of investments in real estate totaling $92.2 million (with proceeds from non-controlling interest totaling $5.1 million and use of deposits from prior periods totaling $3.9 million), building improvements of approximately $3.2 million, additional investment in Houston Preston of approximately $1.0 million and the purchase of an investment in a DST for $2.8 million. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $108.6 million and mainly consisted of proceeds from notes payable of approximately $77.8 million, proceeds from the Company's KeyBank line of credit of approximately $64.4 million, proceeds from issuance of preferred stock of approximately $29.4 million, proceeds from issuance of common stock of approximately $4.9 million, netted with payments on the KeyBank line of credit of approximately $53.6 million, distributions to non-controlling interests of approximately $1.9 million, payments on notes payable of approximately $11.5 million and distributions to stockholders of approximately $1.6 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled approximately $3.6 million. Operating cash flows were used for the payment of normal operating expenses. Net cash used in investing activities totaled approximately $59.4 million and consisted of investments in real estate of approximately $53.7 million, investment in equity method investee of approximately $1.2 million, investments in cost method investees of approximately $2.0 million, investment in cost method investees held for sale of approximately $0.8 million and security deposits on future acquisitions of approximately $4.6 million. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $65.7 million and consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock of approximately $54.0 million, proceeds from notes payable related to a cost method investment property of approximately $6.5 million, distributions of approximately $2.6 million and payments on notes payable of approximately $0.2 million.\nOn October 5, 2016, the Company, through its Operating Partnership, and MVP I (the \"REITs\"), through a wholly owned subsidiary (the \"Borrowers\"), entered into a credit agreement (the \"Unsecured Credit Agreement\") with KeyBank, National Association (\"KeyBank\") as the administrative agent and KeyBank Capital Markets (\"KeyBank Capital Markets\") as the lead arranger. Pursuant to the Unsecured Credit Agreement, the Borrowers were provided with a $30 million unsecured credit facility (the \"Unsecured Credit Facility\"), which could be increased up to $100 million, in minimum increments of $10 million. The Unsecured Credit Facility had an initial term of two years, maturing on October 5, 2018, and could be extended for a one-year period if certain conditions were met and upon payment of an extension fee. The Unsecured Credit Facility had an interest rate calculated based on LIBOR Rate plus 2.25% or Base Rate plus 1.25%, both as provided in the Unsecured Credit Agreement. The Base Rate was calculated as the greater of (i) the KeyBank Prime rate or (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus \u00bd of 1%. Payments under the Unsecured Credit Facility were interest only and were due on the first day of each quarter. The obligations of the Borrowers of the Unsecured Credit Agreement were joint and several. The REITs entered into cross-indemnification provisions with respect to their joint and several obligations under the Unsecured Credit Agreement.\nOn June 26, 2017, the REITs, each through a wholly owned subsidiary, the Operating Partnership and MVP Real Estate Holdings, LLC (together, the \"Borrowers\"), entered into a credit agreement (the \"Working Capital Credit Agreement\") with KeyBank as the administrative agent and KeyBanc Capital Markets as the lead arranger. Pursuant to the Working Capital Credit Agreement, the Borrowers were provided with a $6.0 million credit facility (the \"Total Commitment\"), which could be increased up to $10 million, in minimum increments of $1 million. The Total Commitment had an initial term of six months, maturing on December 26, 2017. In October 2017, the term was extended to March 31, 2018. The Working Capital Credit Agreement had an interest rate calculated based on LIBOR Rate plus 4.5% or Base Rate plus 3.5%, both as provided in the Working Capital Credit Agreement. The Base Rate was calculated as the greater of (i) the KeyBank Prime rate or (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus \u00bd of 1%. Payments under the Working Capital Credit Facility require 100% of the net proceeds of all capital events and equity issuances by the REITs within five business days of receipt. The obligations of the Borrowers of the Unsecured Credit Agreement were joint and several. The REITs entered into cross-indemnification provisions with respect to their joint and several obligations under the Unsecured Credit Agreement.\nOn December 29, 2017, in connection with entering into the New Credit Agreement (as such term is defined below), the Operating Partnership and the Company terminated the existing credit facilities. The Operating Partnership repaid in full all amounts outstanding under the existing credit facilities with the proceeds from the New Credit Agreement. No prepayments fees or early termination penalties were incurred in connection with terminating the existing credit facilities.\nOn December 29, 2017, the Operating Partnership entered into a Credit Agreement (the \"New Credit Agreement\") with the lenders party thereto (the \"Lenders\"), KeyBank as administrative agent (the \"Administrative Agent\"), and KeyBanc Capital Markets as lead arranger. The New Credit Agreement provides for a $50 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"), which consists of a borrowing base revolving credit facility (the \"BB Revolving Credit Facility\") and a working capital revolving credit facility (the \"WC Revolving Credit Facility\"). The New Credit Agreement also provides the Operating Partnership with the option to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility and/or establish one or more new pari passu term loan facilities (each, a \"Term Loan Facility\") up to an aggregate commitment or principal amount of up to $350 million, subject to certain limitations. The BB Revolving Credit Facility and any Term Loan Facility mature on January 3, 2021, with two twelve-month extension options subject to certain conditions set forth in the New Credit Agreement, which, if exercised by the Operating Partnership, would extend the maturity date to January 3, 2023. The WC Revolving Credit Facility matures on January 4, 2019, unless earlier terminated by the Operating Partnership.\nIn connection with our Unsecured Credit Agreement, the Borrowers were required to maintain a minimum liquidity requirement of $2.0 million. The Company maintained compliance to this lender requirement through December 29, 2017, when the amount outstanding under the Unsecured Credit Agreement was paid in full.\nIn addition, the loan with Bank of America for the MVP Detroit garage requires the Company to maintain $2.3 million in liquidity at all times, which is defined as unencumbered cash and cash equivalents. As of June 21, 2018, the Company was in compliance with this lender requirement.\nBorrowings under the New Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of a Margin (as such term is defined below) plus either a rate based on LIBOR for 1, 2 or 3 months or a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the Administrative Agent's prime lending rate, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (3) the LIBOR rate that would be payable on such day for a LIBOR rate loan with a one-month interest period plus 1.00%. For the BB Revolving Credit Facility and any Term Loan Facility, the Margin is determined by the consolidated leverage ratio until the Operating Partnership achieves a senior unsecured credit rating of BBB-/Baa3 from S&P or Moody's at which time the Operating Partnership may elect to use an alternative pricing grid. The Margin for the BB Revolving Credit Facility ranges from 0.75% to 1.50% in the case of base rate loans, and 1.75% to 2.50%, in the case of LIBOR rate loans. The Margin for the Term Loan Facility ranges from 0.70% to 1.45%, in the case of base rate loans, and 1.70% to 2.450%, in the case of LIBOR rate loans. The Margin as of the date of effectiveness of the New Credit Agreement is (1) in respect of BB Revolving Credit Facility, 1.50%, in the case of base rate loans, and 2.50%, in the case of LIBOR rate loans, and (2) in respect of any Term Loan Facility, 1.45%, in the case of base rate loans, and 2.45%, in the case of LIBOR rate loans. For the WC Revolving Credit Facility, the Margin is 3.00% in the case of base rate loans, and 4.00% in the case of LIBOR rate loans.\nThe Company will experience a relative decrease in liquidity as proceeds from its debt or equity financings are used to acquire and operate assets and may experience a temporary, relative increase in liquidity if and when investments are sold, to the extent such sales generate proceeds that are available for additional investments. The Advisor may, but is not required to, establish working capital reserves from proceeds from the Common Stock Offering of cash flow generated by the Company's investments or out of proceeds from the sale of investments. The Company does not anticipate establishing a general working capital reserve; however, the Company may establish capital reserves with respect to particular investments. The Company also may, but is not required to, establish reserves out of cash flow generated by investments or out of net sale proceeds in non-liquidating sale transactions. Working capital reserves are typically utilized to fund tenant improvements, leasing commissions and major capital expenditures. The Company's lenders also may require working capital reserves.\nIn connection with the Company's New Credit Agreement, the Borrowers are required to maintain a minimum liquidity requirement of $2.0 million or 1.0% of the parking asset value, which was defined as the sum of unencumbered cash and cash equivalents of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries.\nThe Company's existing credit agreement also requires the Company to comply with various financial and other covenants. In addition, the failure of Mr. Shustek to be a non-member manager of the Advisor or for the Advisor to continue to manage the Company is an event of default under approximately $71 million of the Company's secured mortgage debt. Please see, for more information, \"Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Financing Strategy - If we breach covenants under our existing credit facility and other indebtedness, we could be held in default under such loans, which could accelerate our repayment date and materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\"\nOn June 19, 2018, the Company (as \"Guarantor\"), the Borrowers and the Lenders entered into an amendment and waiver to the New Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the amendment and waiver, the Lenders agreed to waive the Borrowers' breach of the fixed charge coverage ratio for the period ended March 31, 2018, and the Borrowers' requirement to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio for the period ended June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2018, and the Guarantor's breach of the financial reporting obligations under the credit agreement for the periods ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018. Pursuant to the amendment and waiver, the Lenders, the Borrowers and the Company (as Guarantor) also agreed to the following, among other changes:\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall not be less than (i) at any time on or prior to June 30, 2019, 1.35:1.00, and (ii) at any time thereafter, 1.60:1.00;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the Lenders shall advance approximately $27.4 million to fund the Borrowers' acquisition costs of pending property purchases;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the Borrowers shall make mandatory principal payments on the WC Revolving Credit Facility in the amounts and at the times scheduled therein;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the WC Revolving Credit Facility shall be reduced to $16.1 million and the Lenders' obligations to make WC Revolving Loans shall be terminated;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the Company shall file to list and register its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange or other recognized exchange in the United States by no later than July 31, 2018, obtain approval of such listing application by August 31, 2018 and complete the listing by September 30, 2018;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the Company shall redeem all of its outstanding Series A and Series 1 preferred stock and pay the entire redemption price in the form of shares of the Company's common stock (as is permitted by the articles supplementary governing each series of preferred stock), within 30 days after the completion of the listing of its common stock on a national securities exchange;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the Company shall make no cash distributions to its preferred shareholders after the earlier of (i) 30 days after the completion of the public listing or (ii) September 30, 2018;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the collateral under the existing credit facility shall include certain recently purchased properties and Borrowers shall not be entitled to release any collateral prior to the retirement in full of the WC Revolving Credit Facility; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> prior to the retirement of the WC Revolving Credit Facility, management fees paid by the Company to the Advisor shall not exceed $200,000 per quarter.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo the extent that the working capital reserve is insufficient to satisfy the Company's cash requirements, additional funds may be provided from cash generated from operations or through short-term borrowing. In addition, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, the Company may incur indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of any real estate asset, refinance the debt thereon, arrange for the leveraging of any previously unfinanced property or reinvest the proceeds of financing or refinancing in additional properties.\nGoing Concern Evaluation\nIn connection with preparing consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, management evaluated whether there were conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raised substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date that the financial statements are issued.\nThe Company considered the following:\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Net losses of $11.4 million and $4.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Negative cash flow from operating activities for 2017 and 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOrdinarily, conditions or events that raises substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern relate to the entity's ability to meet its obligations as they become due.\nThe Company evaluated its ability to meet its obligations as they become due within one year from the date that the financial statements are issued by considering the following:\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The Company raised approximately $142 million and $34 million of debt and equity financing, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The Company has historically raised funds from debt and equity financings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> As a result of the Company's restructurings that were implemented during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company's cost structure is now in line with its future revenue projections.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the recent capital raised in 2017, management also believes that the Company will generate enough cash from operations to satisfy its obligations for the next twelve months from the issuance date.\nThe Company will take one or more of the following actions if it starts to trend unfavorably to its internal profitability and cash flow projections, in order to mitigate conditions or events that would raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern:\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Implement additional restructuring and cost reductions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Raise additional capital through short-term loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Raise additional capital by placing secured mortgage debt on unencumbered assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Raise additional capital through a private placement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Dispose of one or more assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had $8.5 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nManagement is not aware of any additional material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, other than national economic conditions affecting the Company's targeted portfolio, the U.S. parking facility industry, which may reasonably be expected to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or incomes to be derived from the operation of the Company's assets.\nIn addition to making investments in accordance with the Company's investment objectives, the Company expects to use its capital resources to make certain payments to the Advisor and the selling agent(s). During the acquisition and development stage, the Company expects to make payments to the Advisor in connection with the selection or purchase of investments, the management of the Company's assets and costs incurred by the Advisor in providing services to us. For a discussion of the compensation to be paid to the Advisor, see \"Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection with the Operations of the Company\", included in Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report for more information. The Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement has a one-year term but may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual consent of the Advisor and the Company's board of directors.\nManagement Compensation Summary\nThe following table summarizes all compensation and fees incurred by us and paid or payable to the Advisor and its affiliates in connection with the Company's organization operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition Fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,957,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,229,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset Management Fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,259,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 197,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Merger Fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,600,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,816,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,426,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDistributions and Stock Dividends\nThe Company intends to make regular cash and stock distributions to its common stockholders and cash distributions to its Series A preferred stock and Series 1 preferred stock, typically on a monthly basis. The actual amount and timing of distributions will be determined by the Company's board of directors in its discretion and typically will depend on the amount of funds available for distribution, which is impacted by current and projected cash requirements, tax considerations and other factors. As a result, the Company's distribution rate and payment frequency may vary from time to time and could be reduced from current levels. However, to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company must make distributions equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income each year.\nCommon Stock\nOn October 23, 2015, the Company announced that its board of directors has approved a plan for payment of initial monthly cash distributions of $0.0625 per share and monthly stock dividends $0.0625 per share, based on a purchase price of $25.00 per common share, commencing after the Company breaks escrow upon receiving subscriptions for the minimum offering amount of $2 million. The initial cash distribution and stock dividend were paid on February 10, 2016 to stockholders of record as of January 24, 2016. The initial cash distributions were paid from offering proceeds rather than funds from operations and therefore may represent a return of capital. There can be no assurance that distributions and dividends will continue to be paid at this rate. The Company's board of directors may at any time change the distribution and dividend rate or suspend payment of distributions and dividends if it determines that such action is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. The Company expects that its board of directors will continue to authorize, and it will declare, distributions based on a record date on the 24th of each month, and it expects to continue to pay distributions on the 10th day of the following month (or the next business day if the 10th is not a business day), monthly in arrears. The Company has not established a minimum distribution level, and its charter does not require that it make distributions to its stockholders; however, the Company anticipates the payment of monthly distributions. The Company may also make special stock dividends.\nFrom inception through December 31, 2017, the Company had paid approximately $1.2 million in cash, issued 72,111 shares of its common stock as DRIP and issued 121,147 shares of its common stock as dividend in distributions to the Company's stockholders. All of the cash distributions were paid from offering proceeds and constituted a return of capital. The Company's total distributions paid for the period presented, the sources of such distributions, the cash flows provided by (used in) operations and the number of shares of common stock issued pursuant to the Company's DRIP are detailed below.\nTo date, all distributions were paid from offering proceeds and therefore may represent a return of capital.\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Distributions Paid in Cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Distributions Paid through DRIP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\nDistributions Paid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Cash Flows Used in Operations (GAAP basis)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1st Quarter, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 161,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 285,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 446,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,672,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2nd Quarter, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 168,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 306,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 474,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3,943,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3rd Quarter, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 172,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 309,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 481,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,329,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 4th Quarter, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 178,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 310,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 488,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (6,678,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 679,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,210,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,889,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (16,622,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Distributions Paid in Cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Distributions Paid through DRIP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\nDistributions Paid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Cash Flows Used in Operations (GAAP basis)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1st Quarter, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (134,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2nd Quarter, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 47,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 67,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 114,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (435,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3rd Quarter, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 85,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 136,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 221,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,181,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 4th Quarter, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 132,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 241,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 373,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,894,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 274,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 458,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 732,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,644,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had declared $952,000 in distributions for Common stockholders, $679,000 of which has been paid.

The Company will file an application to list its common stock on a national securities exchange by July 31, 2018, and the Company will seek to obtain approval of the listing application by August 31, 2018 and complete the listing by September 30, 2018.

However, there can be no assurance that the Company will cause a listing to occur within such time frame or at all.\nThe Company may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fully fund distributions. All or a portion of the distributions may be paid from other sources, such as cash flows from equity offerings, financing activities, borrowings, cash advances from the Advisor, or by way of waiver or deferral of fees. The Company has not established any limit on the extent to which distributions could be funded from these other sources. Accordingly, the amount of distributions paid may not reflect current cash flow from operations and distributions may include a return of capital, rather than a return on capital. If the Company continues to pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, the funds available to the Company for investments would be reduced and the share value may be diluted. The level of distributions will be determined by the board of directors and depend on a number of factors including current and projected liquidity requirements, anticipated operating cash flows and tax considerations, and other relevant items deemed applicable by the board of directors.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Arrangements\nThe Company has entered into agreements with affiliates of its Sponsor, whereby the Company will pay certain fees or reimbursements to the Advisor or its affiliates in connection with, among other things, acquisition and financing activities, asset management services and reimbursement of operating and offering related costs. For additional information see Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report for a discussion of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees.\nOn November 5, 2016, the Company purchased 338,409 shares of MVP I's common stock from an unrelated third party for $3.0 million or $8.865 per share. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company received approximately $189,000 and $34,000, respectively, in stock distributions, related to the Company's ownership of MVP I common stock.\nAt the effective time of the Merger, 174,026 shares of MVP I Common Stock held by the Company was retired.\nInflation\nThe Company expects to include provisions in its tenant leases designed to protect the Company from the impact of inflation. These provisions will include reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements, or in some cases annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain allowance. Due to the generally long-term nature of these leases, annual rent increases may not be sufficient to cover inflation and rent may be below market.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is organized and conducts operations to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Code and to comply with the provisions of the Code with respect thereto. A REIT is generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of its REIT taxable income, which is distributed to its stockholders, provided that at least 90% of such taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met. Our REIT taxable income may substantially exceed or be less than our net income as determined based on GAAP because differences in GAAP and taxable net income consist primarily of allowances for loan losses or doubtful account, write-downs on real estate held for sale, amortization of deferred financing cost, capital gains and losses, and deferred income.\nIf the Company does not qualify as a REIT for the tax year ended December 31, 2017, it will file as a C corporation and deferred tax assets and liabilities will be established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets is provided if the Company believes that it is more likely than not that it will not realize the tax benefit of deferred tax assets based on the available evidence at the time the determination is made. For the tax year ended December 31, 2017, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that it will not realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets, and thus a valuation allowance should be recorded against its net deferred tax assets.\nThe Company will be electing to be treated as a REIT for the tax year beginning January 1, 2017 and ending December 31, 2017 and believes that it has been organized and has operated during 2017 in such a manner to meet the qualifications to be treated as a REIT for federal and state income tax purposes. During 2016, the Company was subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes and filed income tax returns as a C corporation. As such, the Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company uses a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolutions of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions would be sustained upon examination; thus, the Company has not recorded any uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2017.\nA full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was provided since the Company believes that it is more likely than not that it will not realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets. A change in circumstances may cause the Company to change its judgment about whether deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized. The Company would generally report any change in the valuation allowance through its income statement in the period in which such changes in circumstances occur.\nAs a REIT, the Company will generally not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes on earnings distributed to our stockholders, and therefore may not realize deferred tax assets arising during the Company's pre-2017 periods before the Company became a REIT. The Company intends to distribute at least 100% of its taxable income annually and intends to do so for the tax year ending December 31, 2017 and future periods. The Company owns and rents real estate in various states and municipalities within the United States, and, as a result, the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries may have income or other tax return filing requirements, and may be subject to income or franchise taxes, in state and municipal jurisdictions.\nThe Company has a net deferred tax asset of $1.6 million which is subject to a full valuation allowance and thus is not recorded on the Company's balance sheet. The deferred tax asset is primarily made up of net operating losses and capitalized acquisition costs which are deducted for book but capitalized for tax purposes. If the Company makes a REIT election, the net operating losses will not be available to offset future income; however, they may be used to offset any built-in gains. Due to the valuation allowance, the Company's effective rate is approximately 0%.\nREIT Compliance\nThe Company intends to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the year ended December 31, 2017, and therefore the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that the Company distributes to its stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, including and after the taxable year in which the Company initially elects to be taxed as a REIT, the Company will be subject to federal income tax on the taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which qualification is denied. Failing to qualify as a REIT could materially and adversely affect the Company's net income.\nTo qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, the Company will be required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to the Company's stockholders. The Company must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. The Company will monitor the business and transactions that may potentially impact the Company's REIT status. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to federal income tax on the taxable income at regular corporate rates.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSeries A Preferred Stock\nEach investor in the Series A received, for every $1,000 in shares subscribed by such investor, detachable warrants to purchase 30 shares of the Company's common stock if the Company's common stock is listed on a national securities exchange. The warrants' exercise price is equal to 110% of the volume weighted average closing stock price of the Company's common stock over a specified period as determined in accordance with the terms of the warrant; however, in no event shall the exercise price be less than $25 per share. As of December 31, 2017, there were detachable warrants that may be exercised for 84,510 shares of the Company's common stock after the 90th day following the occurrence of a listing event. These potential warrants will expire five years from the 90th day after the occurrence of a listing event. If all the potential warrants outstanding at December 31, 2017 became exercisable because of a listing event and were exercised at the minimum price of $25 per share, gross proceeds to us would be approximately $2.1 million and we would as a result issue an additional 84,510 shares of common stock.\nFor additional information see \"- Liquidity and Capital Resources\" and \"-Preferred Series A Stock\" above and Note R - Preferred Stock and Warrants in in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report for a discussion of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees.\nSeries 1 Preferred Stock\nEach investor in the Series 1 received, for every $1,000 in shares subscribed by such investor, detachable warrants to purchase 35 shares of the Company's common stock if the Company's common stock is listed on a national securities exchange. The warrants' exercise price is equal to 110% of the volume weighted average closing stock price of the Company's common stock over a specified period as determined in accordance with the terms of the warrant; however, in no event shall the exercise price be less than $25 per share. As of December 31, 2017, there were detachable warrants that may be exercised for approximately 1,035,755 shares of the Company's common stock after the 90th day following the occurrence of a listing event. These potential warrants will expire five years from the 90th day after the occurrence of a listing event. If all the potential warrants outstanding at December 31, 2017 became exercisable because of a listing event and were exercised at the minimum price of $25 per share, we would issue an additional 1,035,755 shares of common stock and would receive gross proceeds of approximately $25.9 million.\nFor additional information see \"- Liquidity and Capital Resources\" and \"-Preferred Series A Stock\" above and Note R - Preferred Stock and Warrants in in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report for a discussion of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's accounting policies have been established in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If management's judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions is different, it is possible that different accounting policies will be applied, or different amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses will be recorded, resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements or different amounts reported in the financial statements.\nAdditionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of the Company's results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that management considers to be most critical once the Company commences significant operations. These policies require complex judgment in their application or estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nReal Estate Investments\nInvestments in real estate are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five years for fixtures and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.\nThe Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of the Company's properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to the Company's investments in real estate. These assessments have a direct impact on the Company's net income because if the Company were to shorten the expected useful lives of the Company's investments in real estate, the Company would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.\nThe Company is required to present the operations related to properties that have been sold, or properties that are intended to be sold, as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented. Properties that are intended to be sold are to be designated as \"held for sale\" on the balance sheet.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nThe Company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values. Tangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis. The Company utilizes various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value. Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods. Amounts allocated to land, land improvements, buildings and fixtures are based on cost segregation studies performed by independent third parties or on the Company's analysis of comparable properties in the Company's portfolio. Identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships, as applicable.\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to in-place leases is primarily the difference between the property valued with existing in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and the property valued as if vacant. Factors considered by the Company in its analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, the Company will include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up period. Estimates of costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses are also utilized. Above-market and below-market in-place lease values for owned properties are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. The capitalized above-market lease intangibles are amortized as a decrease to rental income over the remaining term of the lease. The capitalized below-market lease values will be amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining term and any fixed rate renewal periods provided within the respective leases. In determining the amortization period for below-market lease intangibles, the Company initially will consider, and periodically evaluate on a quarterly basis, the likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option. The likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option is determined by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to customer relationship, as applicable, is measured based on the Company's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and the Company's overall relationship with the tenant. Characteristics considered by the Company in determining these values include the nature and extent of the Company's existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors.\nThe value of in-place leases is amortized to expense over the initial term of the respective leases. The value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event, does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building. If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense.\nIn making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company will utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data. The Company will also consider information obtained about each property as a result of the pre-acquisition due diligence, as well as subsequent marketing and leasing activities, in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.\nDeferred Costs\nDeferred costs may consist of deferred financing costs, deferred offering costs and deferred leasing costs. Deferred financing costs represent commitment fees, legal fees and other costs associated with obtaining commitments for financing. These costs are amortized over the terms of the respective financing agreements using the effective interest method. Unamortized deferred financing costs are expensed when the associated debt is refinanced or repaid before maturity.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nThe Parking REIT, Inc., formerly known as MVP REIT II, Inc., is a Maryland corporation formed on May 4, 2015 and intends to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the filing of the federal tax return for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company believes that it has been organized and has operated in a manner that has enabled it to qualify as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 2017; however, if the Company is unable to meet the REIT qualification for 2017, the Company will continue to operate as a C corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2016, the Company ceased all selling efforts for the Common Stock Offering of its common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, at $25.00 per share, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 (No. 333-205893) filed with the SEC under the Securities Act. The Company accepted additional subscriptions through March 31, 2017, the last day of the Common Stock Offering.\nOn October 27, 2016, the Company filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland Articles Supplementary to the charter of the Company classifying and designating 50,000 shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. The Company commenced the private placement of the shares of Series A, together with warrants to acquire the Company's common stock, to accredited investors on November 1, 2016 and closed the offering on March 24, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the Company raised approximately $2.7 million, net of offering costs, in the Series A private placements and has 2,862 shares of Series A issued and outstanding.\nOn March 29, 2017, the Company filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland Articles Supplementary to the charter of the Company classifying and designating 97,000 shares of its authorized capital stock as shares of Series 1 Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (\"Series 1\"), par value $0.0001 per share. On April 7, 2017, the Company commenced the private placement of shares of Series 1, together with warrants to acquire the Company's common stock, to accredited investors. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had raised gross proceeds of approximately $27.4 million, net of offering costs, in the Series 1 private placements and had 29,789 shares of Series 1 issued and outstanding. On January 31, 2018, the Company closed the Series 1 offering.\nThe Company was formed to focus primarily on investments in parking facilities, including parking lots, parking garages and other parking structures throughout the United States and Canada. No more than 10% of the proceeds of the Common Stock Offering will be used for investment in Canadian properties. The Company currently has no investments in Canada. To a lesser extent, the Company may also invest in properties other than parking facilities.\nThe Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. The Company intends to own substantially all of its assets and conduct its operations through the Operating Partnership. The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, MVP REIT II Holdings, LLC, is the sole limited partner of the Operating Partnership. The operating agreement provides that the Operating Partnership is operated in a manner that enables the Company to (1) satisfy the requirements for being classified as a REIT for tax purposes, (2) avoid any federal income or excise tax liability and (3) ensure that the Operating Partnership is not classified as a \"publicly traded partnership\" for purposes of Section 7704 of the Code, which classification could result in the Operating Partnership being taxed as a corporation.\nThe Company utilizes an UPREIT structure to enable the Company to acquire real property in exchange for limited partnership interests in the Company's Operating Partnership from owners who desire to defer taxable gain that would otherwise normally be recognized by them upon the disposition of their real property or transfer of their real property to the Company in exchange for shares of the Company's common stock or cash.\nAs part of the Company's initial capitalization, 8,000 shares of common stock were sold for $200,000 to the Sponsor. The Sponsor is owned 60% by VRM II and 40% by VRM I, which were both managed by Vestin Mortgage prior to being internalized in January 2018.\nThe Company's Advisor is owned 60% by VRM II and 40% by VRM I. The Advisor is responsible for managing the Company's affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying and making investments on the Company's behalf pursuant to the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement. As of June 21, 2018, the Company had no paid employees.\nThe following table is a summary of the acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2017:\n\nThe following table is a summary of the properties acquired in the merger on December 15, 2017:\n\n (1) These properties are held by a single LLC. \nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had investments in the following facilities:\n\n(Table continued)\n\n* The Company acquired a 51.0% interest in MVP St. Louis Cardinal Lot, DST, a Delaware statutory trust, or MVP St Louis, for approximately $2.8 million. MVP St. Louis purchased the St. Louis parking lot from an unrelated third party for a purchase price of $11,350,000, plus payment of closing costs, financing costs (related to a $6.0 million note payable secured by the property), and related transactional costs. MVP St. Louis used the Company's investment to fund a portion of the purchase price for the property. The remaining 49% of the equity portion was funded through short-term investments by the Advisor, which were then later sold to unrelated third parties in the private placement of beneficial interest in MVP St. Louis DST.\nDuring February 2018, the Company, through MVP New Orleans Rampart, LLC (\"MVP New Orleans\"), an entity owned by the Company, closed on the purchase of a parking lot consisting of approximately 78 parking spaces, located in New Orleans, Louisiana, for the purchase price of $8.0 million plus closing costs. The parking lot will be operated by 342 N. Rampart, LLC.\nThe Company believes that it operated in a manner necessary for qualification as a REIT for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company is neither a mutual fund nor an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act nor subject to any regulation thereunder. As a REIT, the Company is required to have a December 31 fiscal year end. As a REIT, the Company will generally not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of its REIT taxable income that is distributed to stockholders. Among other requirements, REITs are required to satisfy certain gross income and asset tests, which may affect the composition of assets the Company acquires with the proceeds of the Common Stock Offering. In addition, REITs are required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of their annual REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain).\nIf the Company does not qualify as a REIT for the tax year ended December 31, 2017, the Company will continue to file as a C corporation, and deferred tax assets and liabilities will be established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets is provided if we believe that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the tax benefit of deferred tax assets based on the available evidence at the time the determination is made. For the tax year ended December 31, 2017, the Company concluded that, due to our cumulative book losses, a valuation allowance should be recorded against our net deferred tax assets.\nThe Company's board of directors will at all times have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over the Company, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to the Company's Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, however, the Company's board of directors has delegated to the Advisor the authority to manage the Company's day-to-day business, in accordance with the Company's investment objectives, strategy, guidelines, policies and limitations. VRM II owns 60% of the Advisor, and the remaining 40% is owned by VRM I; both were managed by Vestin Mortgage until such entity was internalized in January 2018. The Company's Sponsor is owned 60% by VRM II and 40% by VRM I, which were both managed by Vestin Mortgage prior to being internalized in January 2018. The Company also sold 5,000 shares of common stock directly to VRM II.\nVRM I and VRM II are engaged primarily in the business of investing in commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate. As the owners of the Advisor, VRM I and VRM II may benefit from any fees and other compensation that the Company pays to the Advisor under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement. In this regard, the Company notes that the Advisor has agreed to waive certain fees and expenses it otherwise would be entitled under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement. Please refer to Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements - Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection With the Operations of the Company in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report for more information. If the owners of the Advisor determine that such waivers are no longer in the best interests of their stockholders or otherwise refuse to grant future waivers of fees or expenses if requested by the Company, then the Company's operating expenses could increase significantly, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and the amount of distributions to stockholders.\nIn addition, the Company may compete against VRM I and VRM II, both of which are managed by affiliates of the Company's Sponsor, for the acquisition of investments. The Company believes this potential conflict is mitigated, in part, by the Company's focus on parking facilities as its core investments, while the investment strategy of VRM I and VRM II focuses on acquiring office buildings and other commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate.\nFor additional discussion regarding potential conflicts of interests, please see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest\" and \"Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\" in this Annual Report.\nIn October 2016, the board of directors appointed a special committee to evaluate liquidity options. After consideration, in January 2017, the special committee of the board of directors decided to explore a merger with MVP I.\nOn May 26, 2017, the Company, MVI I, Merger Sub and the Advisor entered into the Merger Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, MVP I merged with and into Merger Sub on December 15, 2017, with Merger Sub surviving the Merger such that following the Merger, Merger Sub continued as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger is intended to qualify as a \"reorganization\" under, and within the meaning of, Section 368(a) of the Code. The combined company was subsequently renamed \"The Parking REIT, Inc.\"\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of MVP I Common Stock was automatically cancelled and retired, and converted into the right to receive 0.365 shares of common stock of the Company. Holders of shares of MVP I Common Stock received cash in lieu of fractional shares.\nAt the effective time of the Merger, each share of MVP I Common Stock, if any, then held by any wholly owned subsidiary of MVP I or by the Company or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries became no longer outstanding and was automatically retired and ceased to exist, and no consideration was paid, nor will any other payment or right inure or be made with respect to such shares of MVP I Common Stock in connection with or as a consequence of the Merger. In addition, each share of MVP I's Non-Participating, Non-Voting Convertible Stock, $0.001 par value per share (\"MVP I Convertible Stock\"), all 1,000 of which were held by the Advisor, were automatically retired and ceased to exist, and no consideration was paid, nor will any other payment or right inure or be made with respect to such shares of MVP I Convertible Stock in connection with or as a consequence of the Merger.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company's board of directors increased the number of directors to eight from five prior to the Merger, and Nicholas Nilsen, Robert J. Aalberts and Shawn Nelson, previous directors of MVP I, were elected to the board of directors.\nAmended and Restated Advisory Agreement\nConcurrently with the entry into the Merger Agreement, on May 26, 2017, the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Advisor entered into the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, which became effective at the effective time of the Merger. The Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions upon which we appoint the Advisor to serve as our advisor. The Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement amended the Company's existing advisory agreement, dated October 5, 2015, to provide for, among other amendments, (i) elimination of acquisition fees, disposition fees and subordinated performance fees and (ii) the payment of an asset management fee by the Company to the Advisor calculated and paid monthly in an amount equal to one-twelfth of 1.1% of the (a) cost of each asset then held by the Company, without deduction for depreciation, bad debts or other non-cash reserves, or (b) the Company's proportionate share thereof in the case of an investment made through a joint venture or other co-ownership arrangement excluding (only for clause (b)) debt financing on the investment. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, the asset management fee may not exceed the Asset Management Fee Cap until the earlier of such time, if ever, that (i) the Company holds assets with an Appraised Value (as defined Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement) equal to or in excess of $500,000,000 or (ii) the Company reports AFFO (as defined in the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement) equal to or greater than $0.3125 per share of Company Common Stock (an amount intended to reflect a 5% or greater annualized return on $25.00 per share of the Company's common stock) (the \"Per Share Amount\") for two consecutive quarters, on a fully diluted basis. All amounts of the asset management fee in excess of the Asset Management Fee Cap, plus interest thereon at a rate of 3.5% per annum, will be due and payable by the Company no later than ninety (90) days after the earlier of the date that (i) the Company holds assets with an Appraised Value equal to or in excess of $500,000,000 or (ii) the Company reports AFFO per share of the Company's common stock equal to or greater than the Per Share Amount for two consecutive quarters, on a fully diluted basis.\nIn addition, the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement contains customary indemnification provisions for the Advisor and its affiliates for all liabilities, claims, damages or losses arising in the performance of their duties under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, as well as related expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees. Further, in the event that the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement is terminated for any reason, the Company is prohibited under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement from directly or indirectly soliciting or hiring the employees of the Advisor or any of its affiliates for one year after such termination, and the Company may need to pay the Advisor significant amounts to waive such prohibition. The Company is also prohibited from intentionally interfering with, or enticing away, the relationship of the Advisor or its affiliates with any person who, during the term of the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement or the preceding one-year period, was a tenant, co-investor, co-developer, joint venture or other customer of the Advisor or its affiliates. The Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement have an initial term of one year from the effective date, and may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive one-year terms upon the parties' mutual consent.\nTermination Agreement\nConcurrently with the entry into the Merger Agreement, on May 26, 2017, the Company, MVP I, the Advisor and the Operating Partnership entered into a termination and fee agreement (the \"Termination Agreement\"). Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, the Advisory Agreement, dated September 25, 2012, as amended, among MVP I and the Advisor was terminated, and the Company paid the Advisor an Advisor Acquisition Payment (as such term is defined in the Termination Agreement) of approximately $3.6 million, which was the only fee payable to the Advisor in connection with the Merger.\nThe foregoing description of the Merger Agreement, the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement and the Termination Agreement is only a summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the applicable agreements, each of which is filed with as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 31, 2017.\nAmended Charter\nIn connection with the Merger, at the Company's annual stockholders' meeting held on September 27, 2017, the Company's stockholders approved, among other matters, the amendment and restatement of its charter (the \"Amended Charter\"). As described in more detail in the final proxy statement distributed to our stockholders for the annual meeting, the Amended Charter is primarily intended to accomplish two objectives in connection with the possible listing of the Company's common stock after the closing of the Merger: (1) to remove provisions of our charter that the Company believes may unnecessarily restrict our ability to take advantage of further opportunities for liquidity events or are redundant with or otherwise addressed or permitted to be addressed under Maryland law and (2) to amend certain provisions in a manner that the Company believes would be more suitable for becoming a publicly-traded REIT.\nThe Amended Charter will become effective upon its filing with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland. The Company expects to file the proposed Amended Charter immediately before the Company's common stock becomes listed for trading on a national securities exchange. This means that the changes to the charter will not be effective unless and until we complete an exchange listing.\nReview of the Company's Policies\nThe Company's board of directors, including the independent directors, have reviewed the policies described in this Annual Report and determined that they are in the best interest of the Company's stockholders because: (1) they increase the likelihood that the Company will be able to acquire a diversified portfolio of income producing properties, thereby reducing risk in its portfolio; (2) the Company's executive officers, directors and affiliates of the Advisor have expertise with the type of real estate investments the Company seeks; and (3) borrowings should enable the Company to purchase assets and earn rental income more quickly, thereby increasing the likelihood of generating income for the Company's stockholders and preserving stockholder capital.\nResults of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe Company began purchasing properties in May 2016 and the results of operations below reflect start-up costs as well as acquisition expenses incurred in connection with purchasing properties as the Company seeks to deploy the Company's proceeds from the Common Stock Offering. The Company expects that income and expenses related to the Company's portfolio will increase in future years as a result of owning the properties acquired for a full year and as a result of anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related assets. The results of operations described below may not be indicative of future results of operations.\n For", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nThe Parking REIT, Inc., formerly known as MVP REIT II, Inc., is a Maryland corporation formed on May 4, 2015 and intends to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the filing of the federal tax return for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company believes that it has been organized and has operated in a manner that has enabled it to qualify as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 2017; however, if the Company is unable to meet the REIT qualification for 2017, the Company will continue to operate as a C corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2016, the Company ceased all selling efforts for the Common Stock Offering of its common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, at $25.00 per share, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 (No. 333-205893) filed with the SEC under the Securities Act. The Company accepted additional subscriptions through March 31, 2017, the last day of the Common Stock Offering.\nOn October 27, 2016, the Company filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland Articles Supplementary to the charter of the Company classifying and designating 50,000 shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. The Company commenced the private placement of the shares of Series A, together with warrants to acquire the Company's common stock, to accredited investors on November 1, 2016 and closed the offering on March 24, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the Company raised approximately $2.7 million, net of offering costs, in the Series A private placements and has 2,862 shares of Series A issued and outstanding.\nOn March 29, 2017, the Company filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland Articles Supplementary to the charter of the Company classifying and designating 97,000 shares of its authorized capital stock as shares of Series 1 Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (\"Series 1\"), par value $0.0001 per share. On April 7, 2017, the Company commenced the private placement of shares of Series 1, together with warrants to acquire the Company's common stock, to accredited investors. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had raised gross proceeds of approximately $27.4 million, net of offering costs, in the Series 1 private placements and had 29,789 shares of Series 1 issued and outstanding. On January 31, 2018, the Company closed the Series 1 offering.\nThe Company was formed to focus primarily on investments in parking facilities, including parking lots, parking garages and other parking structures throughout the United States and Canada. No more than 10% of the proceeds of the Common Stock Offering will be used for investment in Canadian properties. The Company currently has no investments in Canada. To a lesser extent, the Company may also invest in properties other than parking facilities.\nThe Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. The Company intends to own substantially all of its assets and conduct its operations through the Operating Partnership. The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, MVP REIT II Holdings, LLC, is the sole limited partner of the Operating Partnership. The operating agreement provides that the Operating Partnership is operated in a manner that enables the Company to (1) satisfy the requirements for being classified as a REIT for tax purposes, (2) avoid any federal income or excise tax liability and (3) ensure that the Operating Partnership is not classified as a \"publicly traded partnership\" for purposes of Section 7704 of the Code, which classification could result in the Operating Partnership being taxed as a corporation.\nThe Company utilizes an UPREIT structure to enable the Company to acquire real property in exchange for limited partnership interests in the Company's Operating Partnership from owners who desire to defer taxable gain that would otherwise normally be recognized by them upon the disposition of their real property or transfer of their real property to the Company in exchange for shares of the Company's common stock or cash.\nAs part of the Company's initial capitalization, 8,000 shares of common stock were sold for $200,000 to the Sponsor.

MVP St. Louis purchased the St. Louis parking lot from an unrelated third party for a purchase price of $11,350,000, plus payment of closing costs, financing costs (related to a $6.0 million note payable secured by the property), and related transactional costs. MVP St. Louis used the Company's investment to fund a portion of the purchase price for the property. The remaining 49% of the equity portion was funded through short-term investments by the Advisor, which were then later sold to unrelated third parties in the private placement of beneficial interest in MVP St. Louis DST.\nDuring February 2018, the Company, through MVP New Orleans Rampart, LLC (\"MVP New Orleans\"), an entity owned by the Company, closed on the purchase of a parking lot consisting of approximately 78 parking spaces, located in New Orleans, Louisiana, for the purchase price of $8.0 million plus closing costs. The parking lot will be operated by 342 N. Rampart, LLC.\nThe Company believes that it operated in a manner necessary for qualification as a REIT for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company is neither a mutual fund nor an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act nor subject to any regulation thereunder. As a REIT, the Company is required to have a December 31 fiscal year end. As a REIT, the Company will generally not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of its REIT taxable income that is distributed to stockholders. Among other requirements, REITs are required to satisfy certain gross income and asset tests, which may affect the composition of assets the Company acquires with the proceeds of the Common Stock Offering. In addition, REITs are required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of their annual REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain).\nIf the Company does not qualify as a REIT for the tax year ended December 31, 2017, the Company will continue to file as a C corporation, and deferred tax assets and liabilities will be established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets is provided if we believe that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the tax benefit of deferred tax assets based on the available evidence at the time the determination is made. For the tax year ended December 31, 2017, the Company concluded that, due to our cumulative book losses, a valuation allowance should be recorded against our net deferred tax assets.\nThe Company's board of directors will at all times have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over the Company, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to the Company's Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, however, the Company's board of directors has delegated to the Advisor the authority to manage the Company's day-to-day business, in accordance with the Company's investment objectives, strategy, guidelines, policies and limitations. VRM II owns 60% of the Advisor, and the remaining 40% is owned by VRM I; both were managed by Vestin Mortgage until such entity was internalized in January 2018. The Company's Sponsor is owned 60% by VRM II and 40% by VRM I, which were both managed by Vestin Mortgage prior to being internalized in January 2018. The Company also sold 5,000 shares of common stock directly to VRM II.\nVRM I and VRM II are engaged primarily in the business of investing in commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate. As the owners of the Advisor, VRM I and VRM II may benefit from any fees and other compensation that the Company pays to the Advisor under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement. In this regard, the Company notes that the Advisor has agreed to waive certain fees and expenses it otherwise would be entitled under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement. Please refer to Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements - Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection With the Operations of the Company in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report for more information. If the owners of the Advisor determine that such waivers are no longer in the best interests of their stockholders or otherwise refuse to grant future waivers of fees or expenses if requested by the Company, then the Company's operating expenses could increase significantly, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and the amount of distributions to stockholders.\nIn addition, the Company may compete against VRM I and VRM II, both of which are managed by affiliates of the Company's Sponsor, for the acquisition of investments. The Company believes this potential conflict is mitigated, in part, by the Company's focus on parking facilities as its core investments, while the investment strategy of VRM I and VRM II focuses on acquiring office buildings and other commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate.\nFor additional discussion regarding potential conflicts of interests, please see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest\" and \"Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\" in this Annual Report.\nIn October 2016, the board of directors appointed a special committee to evaluate liquidity options. After consideration, in January 2017, the special committee of the board of directors decided to explore a merger with MVP I.\nOn May 26, 2017, the Company, MVI I, Merger Sub and the Advisor entered into the Merger Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, MVP I merged with and into Merger Sub on December 15, 2017, with Merger Sub surviving the Merger such that following the Merger, Merger Sub continued as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger is intended to qualify as a \"reorganization\" under, and within the meaning of, Section 368(a) of the Code. The combined company was subsequently renamed \"The Parking REIT, Inc.\"\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of MVP I Common Stock was automatically cancelled and retired, and converted into the right to receive 0.365 shares of common stock of the Company. Holders of shares of MVP I Common Stock received cash in lieu of fractional shares.\nAt the effective time of the Merger, each share of MVP I Common Stock, if any, then held by any wholly owned subsidiary of MVP I or by the Company or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries became no longer outstanding and was automatically retired and ceased to exist, and no consideration was paid, nor will any other payment or right inure or be made with respect to such shares of MVP I Common Stock in connection with or as a consequence of the Merger. In addition, each share of MVP I's Non-Participating, Non-Voting Convertible Stock, $0.001 par value per share (\"MVP I Convertible Stock\"), all 1,000 of which were held by the Advisor, were automatically retired and ceased to exist, and no consideration was paid, nor will any other payment or right inure or be made with respect to such shares of MVP I Convertible Stock in connection with or as a consequence of the Merger.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company's board of directors increased the number of directors to eight from five prior to the Merger, and Nicholas Nilsen, Robert J. Aalberts and Shawn Nelson, previous directors of MVP I, were elected to the board of directors.\nAmended and Restated Advisory Agreement\nConcurrently with the entry into the Merger Agreement, on May 26, 2017, the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Advisor entered into the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, which became effective at the effective time of the Merger. The Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions upon which we appoint the Advisor to serve as our advisor. The Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement amended the Company's existing advisory agreement, dated October 5, 2015, to provide for, among other amendments, (i) elimination of acquisition fees, disposition fees and subordinated performance fees and (ii) the payment of an asset management fee by the Company to the Advisor calculated and paid monthly in an amount equal to one-twelfth of 1.1% of the (a) cost of each asset then held by the Company, without deduction for depreciation, bad debts or other non-cash reserves, or (b) the Company's proportionate share thereof in the case of an investment made through a joint venture or other co-ownership arrangement excluding (only for clause (b)) debt financing on the investment. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, the asset management fee may not exceed the Asset Management Fee Cap until the earlier of such time, if ever, that (i) the Company holds assets with an Appraised Value (as defined Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement) equal to or in excess of $500,000,000 or (ii) the Company reports AFFO (as defined in the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement) equal to or greater than $0.3125 per share of Company Common Stock (an amount intended to reflect a 5% or greater annualized return on $25.00 per share of the Company's common stock) (the \"Per Share Amount\") for two consecutive quarters, on a fully diluted basis. All amounts of the asset management fee in excess of the Asset Management Fee Cap, plus interest thereon at a rate of 3.5% per annum, will be due and payable by the Company no later than ninety (90) days after the earlier of the date that (i) the Company holds assets with an Appraised Value equal to or in excess of $500,000,000 or (ii) the Company reports AFFO per share of the Company's common stock equal to or greater than the Per Share Amount for two consecutive quarters, on a fully diluted basis.\nIn addition, the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement contains customary indemnification provisions for the Advisor and its affiliates for all liabilities, claims, damages or losses arising in the performance of their duties under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, as well as related expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees. Further, in the event that the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement is terminated for any reason, the Company is prohibited under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement from directly or indirectly soliciting or hiring the employees of the Advisor or any of its affiliates for one year after such termination, and the Company may need to pay the Advisor significant amounts to waive such prohibition. The Company is also prohibited from intentionally interfering with, or enticing away, the relationship of the Advisor or its affiliates with any person who, during the term of the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement or the preceding one-year period, was a tenant, co-investor, co-developer, joint venture or other customer of the Advisor or its affiliates. The Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement have an initial term of one year from the effective date, and may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive one-year terms upon the parties' mutual consent.\nTermination Agreement\nConcurrently with the entry into the Merger Agreement, on May 26, 2017, the Company, MVP I, the Advisor and the Operating Partnership entered into a termination and fee agreement (the \"Termination Agreement\"). Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, the Advisory Agreement, dated September 25, 2012, as amended, among MVP I and the Advisor was terminated, and the Company paid the Advisor an Advisor Acquisition Payment (as such term is defined in the Termination Agreement) of approximately $3.6 million, which was the only fee payable to the Advisor in connection with the Merger.\nThe foregoing description of the Merger Agreement, the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement and the Termination Agreement is only a summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the applicable agreements, each of which is filed with as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 31, 2017.\nAmended Charter\nIn connection with the Merger, at the Company's annual stockholders' meeting held on September 27, 2017, the Company's stockholders approved, among other matters, the amendment and restatement of its charter (the \"Amended Charter\"). As described in more detail in the final proxy statement distributed to our stockholders for the annual meeting, the Amended Charter is primarily intended to accomplish two objectives in connection with the possible listing of the Company's common stock after the closing of the Merger: (1) to remove provisions of our charter that the Company believes may unnecessarily restrict our ability to take advantage of further opportunities for liquidity events or are redundant with or otherwise addressed or permitted to be addressed under Maryland law and (2) to amend certain provisions in a manner that the Company believes would be more suitable for becoming a publicly-traded REIT.\nThe Amended Charter will become effective upon its filing with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland. The Company expects to file the proposed Amended Charter immediately before the Company's common stock becomes listed for trading on a national securities exchange. This means that the changes to the charter will not be effective unless and until we complete an exchange listing.\nReview of the Company's Policies\nThe Company's board of directors, including the independent directors, have reviewed the policies described in this Annual Report and determined that they are in the best interest of the Company's stockholders because: (1) they increase the likelihood that the Company will be able to acquire a diversified portfolio of income producing properties, thereby reducing risk in its portfolio; (2) the Company's executive officers, directors and affiliates of the Advisor have expertise with the type of real estate investments the Company seeks; and (3) borrowings should enable the Company to purchase assets and earn rental income more quickly, thereby increasing the likelihood of generating income for the Company's stockholders and preserving stockholder capital.\nResults of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe Company began purchasing properties in May 2016 and the results of operations below reflect start-up costs as well as acquisition expenses incurred in connection with purchasing properties as the Company seeks to deploy the Company's proceeds from the Common Stock Offering. The Company expects that income and expenses related to the Company's portfolio will increase in future years as a result of owning the properties acquired for a full year and as a result of anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related assets. The results of operations described below may not be indicative of future results of operations.\n For"}
