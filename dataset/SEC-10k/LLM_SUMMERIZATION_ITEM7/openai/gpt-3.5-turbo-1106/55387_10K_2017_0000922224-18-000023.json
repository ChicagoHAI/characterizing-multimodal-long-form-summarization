Business.\"\nBusiness Strategy\n(All Registrants)\nFollowing the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, PPL completed its strategic transformation to a fully regulated business model operating seven diverse, high-performing utilities. These utilities are located in the U.K., Pennsylvania and Kentucky and each jurisdiction has different regulatory structures and customer classes. The Company believes this diverse portfolio provides strong earnings and dividend growth potential that will create significant value for its shareowners and positions PPL well for continued growth and success.\nPPL's businesses of WPD, PPL Electric, LG&E and KU plan to achieve growth by providing efficient, reliable and safe operations and strong customer service, maintaining constructive regulatory relationships and achieving timely recovery of costs. These businesses are expected to achieve strong, long-term growth in rate base in the U.S. and RAV in the U.K., driven by planned significant capital expenditures to maintain existing assets and improve system reliability and, for LKE, LG&E and\nKU, to comply with federal and state environmental regulations related to coal-fired electricity generation facilities. Additionally, significant transmission rate base growth is expected through at least 2020 at PPL Electric.\nFor the U.S. businesses, our strategy is to recover capital project costs efficiently through various rate-making mechanisms, including periodic base rate case proceedings using forward test years, annual FERC formula rate mechanisms and other regulatory agency-approved recovery mechanisms designed to limit regulatory lag. In Kentucky, the KPSC has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ECR, DSM, GLT, fuel adjustment clause, gas supply clause and recovery on construction work-in-progress) that reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. In addition, the KPSC requires a utility to obtain a CPCN prior to constructing a facility, unless the construction is an ordinary extension of existing facilities in the usual course of business or does not involve sufficient capital outlay to materially affect the utility's financial condition. Although such KPSC proceedings do not directly address cost recovery issues, the KPSC, in awarding a CPCN, concludes that the public convenience and necessity require the construction of the facility on the basis that the facility is the lowest reasonable cost alternative to address the need. In Pennsylvania, the FERC transmission formula rate, DSIC mechanism, Smart Meter Rider and other recovery mechanisms are in place to reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs.\nRate base growth in the domestic utilities is expected to result in earnings growth for the foreseeable future. In 2017, earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment declined mainly due to the unfavorable impact of lower GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rates. RAV growth is expected in the U.K. Regulated segment during the RIIO-ED1 price control period which ends on March 31, 2023 and to result in earnings growth in 2018 through at least 2020. See \"Item 1. Business - Segment Information - U.K. Regulated Segment\" for additional information on RIIO-ED1.\nTo manage financing costs and access to credit markets, and to fund capital expenditures, a key objective of the Registrants is to maintain their investment grade credit ratings and adequate liquidity positions. In addition, the Registrants have financial and operational risk management programs that, among other things, are designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility, as applicable, related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and counterparty credit quality. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and swaps. See \"Financial Condition - Risk Management\" below for further information.\nEarnings generated by PPL's U.K. subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency translation risk. Because WPD's earnings represent such a significant portion of PPL's consolidated earnings, PPL enters into foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the value of the GBP versus the U.S. dollar. These hedges do not receive hedge accounting treatment under GAAP. See \"Financial and Operational Developments - U.K. Membership in European Union\" for additional discussion of the U.K. earnings hedging activity.\nThe U.K. subsidiaries also have currency exposure to the U.S. dollar to the extent of their U.S. dollar denominated debt. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and cross-currency swaps that contain characteristics of both interest rate and foreign currency exchange contracts.\nAs discussed above, a key component of this strategy is to maintain constructive relationships with regulators in all jurisdictions in which we operate (U.K., U.S. federal and state). This is supported by our strong culture of integrity and delivering on commitments to customers, regulators and shareowners, and a commitment to continue to improve our customer service, reliability and operational efficiency.\nFinancial and Operational Developments\nU.S. Tax Reform (All Registrants)\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the TCJA. Substantially all of the provisions of the TCJA are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The TCJA includes significant changes to the taxation of corporations, including provisions specifically applicable to regulated public utilities. The more significant changes that impact the Registrants are:\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, effective January 1, 2018;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The exclusion from U.S. federal taxable income of dividends from foreign subsidiaries and the associated \"transition tax;\"\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Limitations on the tax deductibility of interest expense, with an exception to these limitations for regulated public utilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Full current year expensing of capital expenditures with an exception for regulated public utilities that qualify for the exception to the interest expense limitation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The continuation of certain rate normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits. For non-regulated businesses, the TCJA generally provides for full expensing of property acquired after September 27, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result, PPL expects cash flows at its domestic utilities to decline as the benefit of the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate is passed through to its utility customers. In addition, as PPL is not a current federal tax payer because of available net operating loss carry forwards, there is no immediate corporate cash benefit associated with the lower tax rate. The lack of cash benefit resulted in degradation of PPL's projected financial credit metrics. In an effort to maintain its current credit rating, PPL, among other things, currently plans to issue about $1 billion of equity in 2018. This compares to PPL's actual 2017 equity issuances of $482 million.\nThe changes enacted by the TCJA were recorded as an adjustment to the Registrants' deferred tax provision, and have been reflected in \"Income Taxes\" on the Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017 as follows:\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>PPL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PPL Electric\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LKE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LG&E\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>KU\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe components of these adjustments are discussed below:\nReduction of U.S. Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate\nAt the date of enactment, the Registrants' deferred taxes were remeasured based upon the new U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 21%. For PPL's regulated entities, the changes in deferred taxes were, in large part, recorded as an offset to either a regulatory asset or regulatory liability and will be reflected in future rates charged to customers. The rate reduction on non-regulated deferred tax assets and liabilities were recorded as an adjustment to the Registrants' deferred tax provision, and have been reflected in \"Income Taxes\" on the Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017 as follows:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>PPL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PPL Electric\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LKE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LG&E\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>KU\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor PPL's U.S. regulated operations, reductions in accumulated deferred income tax balances due to the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% under the provisions of the TCJA may result in amounts previously collected from utility customers for these deferred taxes to be refundable to such customers over a period of time. The TCJA includes provisions that stipulate how these excess deferred taxes are to be passed back to customers for certain accelerated tax depreciation benefits. Potential refunds of other deferred taxes will be determined by the Registrants' regulators. The Balance Sheets at December 31, 2017 reflect the increase to the Registrants' net regulatory liabilities as a result of the TCJA as follows:\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>PPL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PPL Electric\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LKE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LG&E\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>KU\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Increase in Regulatory Liabilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>634\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTransition Tax\nThe TCJA included a conversion from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, effective January 1, 2018. In the transition to the territorial regime, a one-time transition tax was imposed on PPL's unrepatriated accumulated foreign earnings in 2017. These earnings were treated as a taxable deemed dividend to PPL of approximately $462 million. As the PPL consolidated U.S. group had a taxable loss for 2017, inclusive of the taxable deemed dividend, the foreign tax credits associated with the deemed dividend were recorded as a deferred tax asset. However, it is expected that under the TCJA, the current and prior year foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be fully realizable.\nAs a result, the net deferred income tax expense impact of the deemed repatriation was $101 million and was recorded in \"Income Taxes\" on the PPL Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017 and \"Deferred tax liabilities\" on the PPL Balance Sheet at December 31, 2017.\nSee Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\nU.K. Membership in European Union (PPL)\nOn March 29, 2017, the U.K. formally notified the European Council of the European Union (EU) of its intent to withdraw from the EU, thereby commencing the two-year negotiation period to establish the terms of that withdrawal under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Article 50 specifies that if a member state decides to withdraw from the EU, it must notify the European\nCouncil of its intention to leave the EU, negotiate the terms of withdrawal and establish the legal grounds for its future relationship with the EU. Article 50 provides two years from the date of the Article 50 notification to conclude negotiations. Failure to complete negotiations within two years, unless negotiations are extended, would result in the treaties governing the EU no longer being applicable to the U.K. with there being no agreement in place governing the U.K.'s relationship with the EU. Under the terms of Article 50, negotiations can only be extended beyond two years if all of the 27 remaining EU states agree to an extension. Any withdrawal agreement will need to be approved by both the European Council and the European Parliament. There remains significant uncertainty as to the ultimate outcome of the withdrawal negotiations and the related impact on the U.K. economy and the GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rate.\nPPL has executed hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange risk to the Company's U.K. earnings. As of February 20, 2018, PPL's foreign exchange exposure related to budgeted earnings is 100% hedged for the remainder of 2018 at an average rate of $1.34 per GBP, 100% hedged for 2019 at an average rate of $1.39 per GBP and 35% hedged for 2020 at an average rate of $1.46 per GBP.\nPPL cannot predict either the short-term or long-term impact to foreign exchange rates or long-term impact on PPL's financial condition that may be experienced as a result of the actions taken by the U.K. government to withdraw from the EU, although such impacts could be significant.\nRegulatory Requirements\n(All Registrants)\nThe Registrants cannot predict the impact that future regulatory requirements may have on their financial condition or results of operations.\n(PPL)\nRIIO-2 Framework Review\nIn July 2017, Ofgem published an open letter commencing its RIIO-2 framework review, which covers all U.K. gas and electricity, transmission and distribution price controls. The purpose of this framework review is to build on lessons learned from the current price controls and to develop a framework that will be adaptable to meeting the needs of an evolving U.K. energy sector.\nThe letter sets out the context for the development of the next price controls, RIIO-2, and seeks views from stakeholders on the RIIO-2 framework. Responses to the open letter were published in September 2017 and will be used to guide the full RIIO-2 framework consultation which is expected to be published in March of 2018. The promulgation of sector specific price controls will begin with the gas and electricity transmission networks, with electricity distribution price control work scheduled to begin in 2020, at which time Ofgem plans to publish its RIIO-ED2 strategy consultation document.\nThe current electricity distribution price control, RIIO-ED1, continues through March 31, 2023 and will not be impacted by this RIIO-2 consultation process. PPL cannot predict the outcome of this process or the long-term impact it or the final RIIO-ED2 regulations will have on its financial condition or results of operations.\nRIIO-ED1 Mid-period Review\nIn December 2017, Ofgem initiated a consultation on a potential RIIO-ED1 mid-period review (MPR). The RIIO framework allows for a MPR of outputs halfway through the price control. Ofgem is consulting on three potential approaches:\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether to implement a MPR as currently defined;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether to implement a MPR with an extension for WPD rail electrification; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether to implement a MPR with a significant extension of scope to include financial parameters.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOfgem's initial assessment as set forth in its December 2017 consultation publication is that a MPR as currently defined under RIIO-ED1 is not required. In addition, Ofgem recognized that the rail electrification is outside the scope of the MPR and that implementing a MPR to include financial parameters could undermine the stability of the regulatory regime. The consultation, however, requests interested party comments on those conclusions. The period for submission of comments to the consultation closed on February 2, 2018. Formal consultation responses have been submitted by PPL and WPD. A decision on whether to\nproceed with a MPR is expected in spring 2018. If Ofgem decides to launch a MPR, it will consult on detailed proposals in summer 2018 and any associated changes to DNO licenses would be in place by April 1, 2019. Although, PPL cannot predict the outcome of the consultation process, a MPR is not expected to have a significant impact on PPL's financial condition or results of operations.\n(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nThe businesses of LKE, LG&E and KU are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to CCRs, GHG, ELGs and the Clean Power Plan. See Note 6, Note 13 and Note 19 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these significant environmental matters. These and other stringent environmental requirements led PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU to retire approximately 800 MW of coal-fired generating plants in Kentucky, primarily in 2015. Additionally, KU anticipates retiring two older coal-fired units at the E.W. Brown plant in 2019 with a combined summer rating capacity of 272 MW.\nAlso as a result of the environmental requirements discussed above, LKE projects $828 million ($335 million at LG&E and $493 million at KU) in environmental capital investment over the next five years. See PPL's \"Financial Condition - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures\", Note 6 and Note 13 for additional information.\nRate Case Proceedings\n(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nIn November 2016, LG&E and KU filed requests with the KPSC for increases in annual base electricity and gas rates. LG&E's and KU's applications included requests for CPCNs for implementing an Advanced Metering System program and a Distribution Automation program.\nIn April and May 2017, LG&E and KU, along with all intervening parties to the proceeding, filed with the KPSC, stipulation and recommendation agreements (stipulations) resolving all issues with the parties. Among other things, the proposed stipulations provided for increases in annual revenue requirements associated with LG&E base electricity rates of $59 million, LG&E base gas rates of $8 million and KU base electricity rates of $55 million, reflecting a return on equity of 9.75%, the withdrawal of LG&E's and KU's request for a CPCN for the Advanced Metering System and other changes to the revenue requirements, which dealt primarily with the timing of cost recovery, including depreciation rates.\nIn June 2017, the KPSC issued orders approving, with certain modifications, the proposed stipulations filed in April and May 2017. The orders modified the stipulations to provide for increases in annual revenue requirements associated with LG&E base electricity rates of $57 million, LG&E base gas rates of $7 million, KU base electricity rates of $52 million and incorporated an authorized return on equity of 9.7%. Consistent with the stipulations, the orders approved LG&E's and KU's request for implementing a Distribution Automation program and their withdrawal of a request for a CPCN for the Advanced Metering System program. The orders also approved new depreciation rates for LG&E and KU that resulted in higher depreciation of approximately $15 million ($4 million for LG&E and $11 million for KU) in 2017, exclusive of net additions to PP&E. The orders resulted in base electricity and gas rate increases of 5.2% and 2.1% at LG&E and a base electricity rate increase of 3.2% at KU. The new base rates and all elements of the orders became effective July 1, 2017. On June 23, 2017, the KPSC issued orders establishing an authorized return on equity of 9.7% for all of LG&E's and KU's existing approved ECR plans and projects, replacing the prior authorized return on equity levels of 9.8% for CCR projects and 10% for all other ECR approved projects, effective with bills issued in August 2017. The annual impact of the new authorized return for ECR projects is not expected to be significant.\n(LKE and KU)\nOn September 29, 2017, KU filed a request seeking approval from the VSCC to increase annual Virginia base electricity revenue by $7 million, representing an increase of 10.4%. KU's request is based on an authorized 10.42% return on equity. Subject to regulatory review and approval, new rates would become effective July 1, 2018.\n(PPL, LKE and KU)\nIn October 2016, KU filed a request with the FERC to modify its formula rates to provide for the recovery of CCR impoundment closure costs from its departing municipal customers. In December 2016, the FERC accepted the revised rate schedules providing recovery of the costs effective December 31, 2016, subject to refund, and established limited hearing and settlement judge procedures relating to determining the applicable amortization period. In March 2017, the parties reached a\nsettlement in principle regarding a suitable amortization period. In June 2017, a FERC judge issued an order implementing the settlement's rates on an interim basis, effective July 1, 2017. In August 2017, the FERC issued a final order approving the settlement.\nTCJA Impact on LG&E and KU Rates (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nOn December 21, 2017, Kentucky Industrial Utility Customers, Inc. submitted a complaint with the KPSC against LG&E and KU, as well as other utility companies in Kentucky, alleging that their respective rates would no longer be fair, just and reasonable following the enactment of the TCJA reducing the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The complaint requested the KPSC to issue an order requiring LG&E and KU to begin deferring, as of January 1, 2018, the revenue requirement effect of all income tax expense savings resulting from the federal corporate income tax reduction, including the amortization of excess deferred income taxes by recording those savings in a regulatory liability account and establishing a process by which the federal corporate income tax savings will be passed back to customers.\nOn December 27, 2017, as a result of the complaint, the KPSC ordered LG&E and KU to satisfy or address the complaint and commence recording regulatory liabilities to reflect the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate to 21% and the associated savings in excess deferred taxes on an interim basis until utility rates are adjusted to reflect the federal tax savings.\nOn January 8, 2018, LG&E and KU responded to the complaint, denying certain claims in the complaint but concurring that the TCJA will result in savings for their customers. LG&E and KU have stated in their responses that the companies have recorded regulatory liabilities as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate and the associated savings in excess deferred taxes and will make changes to their ECR, DSM and LG&E's GLT rate mechanisms to begin providing the applicable savings to customers. LG&E and KU also offered to establish a new bill credit mechanism effective with the April 2018 billing cycle to begin distributing the tax savings associated with base rates to customers.\nOn January 29, 2018, LG&E and KU reached a settlement agreement to commence returning savings related to the TCJA to their customers. The savings will be distributed through their ECR, DSM and LG&E's GLT rate mechanisms beginning in March 2018 and through a new bill credit mechanism from April 1, 2018 through April 30, 2019. The estimated impact of the rate reduction represents approximately $91 million in KU electricity revenues, $69 million in LG&E electricity revenues and $17 million in LG&E gas revenues for the period January 2018 through April 2019. Ongoing tax savings are expected to also be addressed in LG&E's and KU's next Kentucky base rate case. LG&E and KU have indicated their intent to file an application for base rate changes during 2018 to be effective during spring 2019. The settlement agreement is subject to review and approval by the KPSC. An order in the proceeding may occur during the first quarter of 2018.\nAdditionally, on January 8, 2018, the VSCC ordered KU, as well as other utilities in Virginia, to accrue regulatory liabilities reflecting the Virginia jurisdictional revenue requirement impacts of the reduced federal corporate tax rate.\nThe FERC has not issued any guidance on the effect on rates of the TCJA.\nLG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.\nTCJA Impact on PPL Electric Rates (PPL and PPL Electric)\nThe PUC issued a Secretarial Letter on February 12, 2018 regarding the TCJA. The Commission is requesting comments from interested parties addressing whether the Commission should adjust current customer rates to reflect the reduced federal income tax expense and, if so, the appropriate negative surcharge or other methodology that would permit immediate adjustment to consumer rates, and whether the surcharge or other said methodology should provide that any refunds to customers due to reduced taxes be effective as of January 1, 2018. In addition, the Secretarial Letter requests certain Pennsylvania regulated utilities, including PPL Electric, to provide certain data related to the effect of the TCJA on PPL Electric's income tax expense and rate base including whether any of the potential tax savings from the reduced federal corporate tax rate can be used for purposes other than to reduce customer rates. PPL Electric's responses are due to the PUC not later than March 9, 2018.\nThe FERC has not issued any guidance on the effect on rates of the TCJA.\nDiscontinued Operations (PPL)\nThe operations of PPL's Supply segment prior to its June 1, 2015 spinoff are included in \"Loss from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes)\" on the 2015 Statement of Income.\nSee Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information related to the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, including the components of Discontinued Operations.\nResults of Operations\n(PPL)\nThe \"Statement of Income Analysis\" discussion below describes significant changes in principal line items on PPL's Statements of Income, comparing year-to-year changes. The \"Segment Earnings\" and \"Margins\" discussions for PPL provide a review of results by reportable segment. These discussions include non-GAAP financial measures, including \"Earnings from Ongoing Operations\" and \"Margins,\" and provide explanations of the non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The \"2018 Outlook\" discussion identifies key factors expected to impact 2018 earnings.\nTables analyzing changes in amounts between periods within \"Statement of Income Analysis,\" \"Segment Earnings\" and \"Margins\" are presented on a constant GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rate basis, where applicable, in order to isolate the impact of the change in the exchange rate on the item being explained.

The enacted tax law included a conversion from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, effective January 1, 2018. In the transition to the territorial regime, a one-time transition tax was imposed on PPL's unrepatriated accumulated foreign earnings in 2017. These earnings were treated as a taxable deemed dividend to PPL of approximately $462 million, including $205 million of foreign tax credits. As the PPL consolidated U.S. group had a taxable loss for 2017, inclusive of the taxable deemed dividend, these credits were recorded as a deferred tax asset. However, it is expected that under the TCJA, only $83 million of the $205 million of foreign tax credits will be realized in the carry forward period. Accordingly, a valuation allowance on the current year foreign tax credits in the amount of $122 million has been recorded to reflect the reduction in the future utilization of the credits. The foreign tax credits\nassociated with the deemed repatriation result in a gross carryforward and corresponding deferred tax asset of $205 million offset by a valuation allowance of $122 million.\nPPL recorded lower income taxes in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily attributable to foreign tax credit carryforwards, arising from a decision to amend prior year tax returns to claim foreign tax credits rather than deduct foreign taxes. This decision was prompted by changes to the Company's most recent business plan.\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(d)\n</td> <td>The U.K. Finance Act 2016, enacted in September 2016, reduced the U.K. statutory income tax rate effective April 1, 2020 from 18% to 17%.

PPL believes that Earnings from Ongoing Operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of PPL's earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions. In addition, PPL's management uses Earnings from Ongoing Operations in measuring achievement of certain corporate performance goals, including targets for certain executive incentive compensation. Other companies may use different measures to present financial performance.\nEarnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the impact of special items. Special items are presented in the financial tables on an after-tax basis with the related income taxes on special items separately disclosed.

Margins, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to $81 million from the April 1, 2016 price increase, partially offset by $30 million from lower volumes and $21 million from the April 1, 2017 price decrease, which includes lower true-up mechanisms partially offset by higher base demand revenue.\nU.K. Gross Margins, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to $166 million from the April 1, 2016 price increase, which included $39 million of the recovery of prior customer rebates, and $21 million of other revenue adjustments in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by $89 million from the April 1, 2015 price decrease resulting from the commencement of RIIO-ED1 and $36 million from lower volumes.\nKentucky Gross Margins\nKentucky Gross Margins increased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to higher base rates of $58 million ($32 million at LG&E and $26 million at KU) and gas cost recoveries added to base rates of $5 million at LG&E, partially offset by $41 million of lower sales volumes due to milder weather in 2017 ($15 million at LG&E and $26 million at KU).\nThe increases in base rates were the result of new rates approved by the KPSC effective July 1, 2017. The gas cost recoveries added to base rates were the result of the transfer of certain GLT expenses into base rates as a result of the 2016 Kentucky rate case. This transfer results in depreciation and other operation and maintenance expenses associated with the GLT program being excluded from margins in the second half of 2017, while the recovery of such costs remain in Kentucky Gross Margins through base rates.\nKentucky Gross Margins increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to higher base rates of $68 million ($4 million at LG&E and $64 million at KU) and returns on additional environmental capital investments of $13 million at LG&E. The increases in base rates were the result of new rates approved by the KPSC effective July 1, 2015.\nPennsylvania Gross Margins\nDistribution\nDistribution margins decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to $10 million of lower electricity sales volumes due to milder weather in 2017, partially offset by $7 million of returns on additional Smart Meter capital investments.\nDistribution margins increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to $121 million of higher base rates, effective January 1, 2016 as a result of the 2015 rate case.\nTransmission\nTransmission margins increased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to an increase of $51 million from returns on additional transmission capital investments focused on replacing aging infrastructure and improving reliability, partially offset by a $17 million decrease as a result of a lower PPL zonal peak load billing factor which affected transmission revenue in the first five months of 2017.\nTransmission margins increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to returns on additional capital investments focused on replacing aging infrastructure and improving reliability.\nReconciliation of Margins\nThe following tables contain the components from the Statement of Income that are included in the non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to

The increase in net income reflects the 2017 unfavorable impact of U.S. tax reform and unrealized losses on foreign currency economic hedges. Excluding these 2017 special items, the increase is primarily attributable to increases in the U.K. Regulated and Pennsylvania Regulated segments. The following projections and factors underlying these projections (on an after-tax basis) are provided for PPL's segments and the Corporate and Other category and the related Registrants.\n(PPL's U.K. Regulated Segment)\nHigher net income is projected in 2018 compared with 2017. The increase in net income reflects the 2017 unfavorable impact of U.S. tax reform and unrealized losses on foreign currency economic hedges. Excluding these 2017 special items, the increase is expected to be driven primarily by higher assumed GBP exchange rates and higher pension income, partially offset by higher taxes.\n(PPL's Kentucky Regulated Segment and LKE, LG&E and KU)\nHigher net income is projected in 2018 compared with 2017, which reflects the 2017 unfavorable impact of U.S. tax reform.\nExcluding this 2017 special item, earnings in 2018 compared with 2017 are projected to be lower, driven primarily by higher operation and maintenance expense, higher depreciation expense, higher interest expense and a lower tax shield on holding company interest and expenses, partially offset by an assumed return to normal weather and higher base electricity and gas rates effective July 1, 2017.\n(PPL's Pennsylvania Regulated Segment and PPL Electric)\nHigher net income is projected in 2018 compared with 2017, driven primarily by higher transmission earnings and lower operation and maintenance expense, partially offset by higher depreciation expense and higher interest expense.\n(PPL's Corporate and Other Category)\nLower costs are projected in 2018 compared with 2017, which reflects the 2017 unfavorable impact of U.S. tax reform. Excluding this 2017 special item, costs are projected to be flat in 2018 compared to 2017, due to a lower tax shield on holding company interest expense offset by lower financing costs.\n(All Registrants)\nEarnings in future periods are subject to various risks and uncertainties.

The increase in project expenditures for PPL Electric was primarily due to an increase in capital spending related to the ongoing efforts to improve reliability and replace aging infrastructure, as well as the roll-out of the Act 129 Smart Meter program. The increase in expenditures for LKE, LG&E and KU was primarily due to increased spending for environmental water projects at LG&E's Mill Creek plant, CCR projects at the Trimble County plant and increased spending on various transmission projects at KU, partially offset by lower spending driven by completion of environmental air projects. The decrease in expenditures at WPD was primarily due to a decrease in foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by an increase in expenditures to enhance system reliability.\nFor PPL, in 2016 compared with 2015, lower project expenditures at WPD, LKE, LG&E and KU were partially offset by higher project expenditures at PPL Electric. The decrease in expenditures for WPD was primarily due to a decrease in expenditures to enhance system reliability and a decrease in foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in expenditures for LG&E was primarily driven by the completion of the environmental air projects at LG&E's Mill Creek Plant. The decrease in expenditures for KU was primarily driven by the completion of the environmental air projects at KU's Ghent plant and the CCR project at KU's E.W. Brown plant. The increase in expenditures for PPL Electric was primarily due to the Northern Lehigh and Greater Scranton transmission reliability projects and other various transmission and distribution projects, partially offset by the completion of the Northeast Pocono reliability project and Susquehanna-Roseland transmission project.\nThe change in \"Investment activity, net\" for 2016 compared with 2015 resulted from PPL receiving $136 million during 2015 for the sale of short-term investments.\nSee \"Forecasted Uses of Cash\" for detail regarding projected capital expenditures for the years 2018 through 2022.\nFinancing Activities\n(All Registrants)\nThe components of the change in cash provided by (used in) financing activities were as follows.\nTable 346: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>PPL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PPL\nElectric\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LKE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LG&E\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>KU\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change -

In November 2017, PPL declared its quarterly common stock dividend, payable January 2, 2018, at 39.5 cents per share (equivalent to $1.58 per annum). On February 22, 2018, PPL announced that the company is increasing its common stock dividend to 41.0 cents per share on a quarterly basis (equivalent to 1.64 per annum). Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other relevant factors.\nSee Note 8 to the Financial Statements for information regarding the June 1, 2015 distribution to PPL's shareowners of a newly formed entity, Holdco, which at closing owned all of the membership interests of PPL Energy Supply and all of the common stock of Talen Energy.\nSubject to certain exceptions, PPL may not declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution on its capital stock during any period in which PPL Capital Funding defers interest payments on its 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes due 2067 or 2013 Series B Junior Subordinated Notes due 2073. At December 31, 2017, no interest payments were deferred.\n(PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nFrom time to time, as determined by their respective Board of Directors, the Registrants pay dividends or distributions, as applicable, to their respective shareholders or members. Certain of the credit facilities of PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU include minimum debt covenant ratios that could effectively restrict the payment of dividends or distributions.\n(All Registrants)\nSee Note 7 to the Financial Statements for these and other restrictions related to distributions on capital interests for the Registrants and their subsidiaries.\nPurchase or Redemption of Debt Securities\nThe Registrants will continue to evaluate outstanding debt securities and may decide to purchase or redeem these securities in open market or privately negotiated transactions, in exchange transactions or otherwise, depending upon prevailing market conditions, available cash and other factors, and may be commenced or suspended at any time. The amounts involved may be material.\nRating Agency Actions\nMoody's and S&P periodically review the credit ratings of the debt of the Registrants and their subsidiaries. Based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations.\nA credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues. The credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries are based on information provided by the Registrants and other sources. The ratings of Moody's and S&P are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of the Registrants or their subsidiaries. Such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities.\nThe credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries affect their liquidity, access to capital markets and cost of borrowing under their credit facilities. A downgrade in the Registrants' or their subsidiaries' credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. The Registrants and their subsidiaries have no credit rating triggers that would result in the reduction of access to capital markets or the acceleration of maturity dates of outstanding debt.\nThe following table sets forth the Registrants' and their subsidiaries' credit ratings for outstanding debt securities or commercial paper programs as of December 31, 2017.\nTable 373: <table><tr><td>

Utilities Company Project) due 2034, each previously issued on behalf of KU.\nRatings Triggers\n(PPL)\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the Financial Statements, certain of WPD's senior unsecured notes may be put by the holders to the issuer for redemption if the long-term credit ratings assigned to the notes are withdrawn by any of the rating agencies (Moody's or S&P) or reduced to a non-investment grade rating of Ba1 or BB+ or lower in connection with a restructuring event. A restructuring event includes the loss of, or a material adverse change to, the distribution licenses under which WPD (East Midlands), WPD (South West), WPD (South Wales) and WPD (West Midlands) operate and would be a trigger event for each company. These notes totaled \u00a34.7 billion (approximately $6.4 billion) nominal value at December 31, 2017.\n(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nVarious derivative and non-derivative contracts, including contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel, commodity transportation and storage, interest rate and foreign currency instruments (for PPL), contain provisions that require the posting of additional collateral, or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract, if PPL's, LKE's, LG&E's or KU's or their subsidiaries' credit rating, as applicable, were to fall below investment grade. See Note 17 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of \"Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features,\" including a discussion of the potential additional collateral requirements for PPL, LKE and LG&E for derivative contracts in a net liability position at December 31, 2017.\nGuarantees for Subsidiaries (PPL)\nPPL guarantees certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements. Some of the guarantees contain financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements, accelerate maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions. At this\ntime, PPL believes that these covenants will not limit access to relevant funding sources. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information about guarantees.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements (All Registrants)\nThe Registrants have entered into certain agreements that may contingently require payment to a guaranteed or indemnified party. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these agreements.\nRisk Management\nMarket Risk\n(All Registrants)\nSee Notes 1, 16, and 17 to the Financial Statements for information about the Registrants' risk management objectives, valuation techniques and accounting designations.\nThe forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions and model assumptions. Actual future results may differ materially from those presented. These are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but are rather only indicators of possible losses under normal market conditions at a given confidence level.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Registrants and their subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. The Registrants and their subsidiaries utilize various financial derivative instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of their debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under the risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolios due to changes in the absolute level of interest rates. In addition, the interest rate risk of certain subsidiaries is potentially mitigated as a result of the existing regulatory framework or the timing of rate cases.\nThe following interest rate hedges were outstanding at December 31.\nTable 374: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Exposure\nHedged\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value,\nNet - Asset\n(Liability) (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect of a\n10% Adverse\nMovement\nin Rates (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturities\nRanging\nThrough\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Exposure\nHedged\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value,\nNet - Asset\n(Liability) (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect of a\n10% Adverse\nMovement\nin Rates (b)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PPL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow hedges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cross-currency swaps (c)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(84\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(90\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic hedges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate swaps (d)\n</td> <td>147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LKE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic hedges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate swaps (d)\n</td> <td>147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LG&E\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic hedges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate swaps (d)\n</td> <td>147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 375: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Includes accrued interest, if applicable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 376: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>Effects of adverse movements decrease assets or increase liabilities, as applicable, which could result in an asset becoming a liability.

The Registrants maintain credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparty credit (including requirements that counterparties maintain specified credit ratings) and require other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk. However, the Registrants, as applicable, have concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities, financial institutions and energy marketing and trading companies. These concentrations may impact the Registrants' overall exposure to credit risk, positively or negatively, as counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions.\n(PPL and PPL Electric)\nIn January 2017, the PUC issued a Final Order approving PPL Electric's PLR procurement plan for the period June 2017 through May 2021, which includes a total of eight solicitations for electricity supply semi-annually in April and October. To date, PPL Electric has conducted two of its planned eight competitive solicitations.\nUnder the standard Supply Master Agreement (the Agreement) for the competitive solicitation process, PPL Electric requires all suppliers to post collateral if their credit exposure exceeds an established credit limit. In the event a supplier defaults on its obligation, PPL Electric would be required to seek replacement power in the market. All incremental costs incurred by PPL Electric would be recoverable from customers in future rates. At December 31, 2017, most of the successful bidders under all of the solicitations had an investment grade credit rating from S&P, and were not required to post collateral under the Agreement. A small portion of bidders were required to post an insignificant amount of collateral under the Agreement. There is no instance under the Agreement in which PPL Electric is required to post collateral to its suppliers.\nSee Note 17 to the Financial Statements for additional information on credit risk.\nForeign Currency Translation (PPL)\nThe value of the British pound sterling fluctuates in relation to the U.S. dollar. In 2017, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of $537 million, which primarily reflected a $935 million increase to PP&E and $198 million increase to goodwill partially offset by a $549 million increase to long-term debt and an increase of $47 million to other net liabilities. In 2016, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $1.1 billion, which primarily reflected a $2.1 billion decrease to PP&E and $490 million decrease to goodwill partially offset by a $1.3 billion decrease to long-term debt and a decrease of $208 million to other net liabilities. In 2015, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $240 million, which primarily reflected a $472 million decrease to PP&E and $117 million decrease to goodwill partially offset by a $285 million decrease to long-term debt and a decrease of $64 million to other net liabilities.\n(All Registrants)\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe Registrants are not aware of any material ownership interests or operating responsibility by senior management in outside partnerships, including leasing transactions with variable interest entities, or other entities doing business with the Registrants. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information on related party transactions for PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU.\nAcquisitions, Development and Divestitures\nThe Registrants from time to time evaluate opportunities for potential acquisitions, divestitures and development projects. Development projects are reexamined based on market conditions and other factors to determine whether to proceed with,\nmodify or terminate the projects. Any resulting transactions may impact future financial results. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for information on the more significant activities.\n(PPL)\nSee Note 8 to the Financial Statements for information on the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply.\n(All Registrants)\nEnvironmental Matters\nExtensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to PPL's, PPL Electric's, LKE's, LG&E's and KU's air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, as well as other aspects of the Registrants' businesses. The cost of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with certainty but could be significant. In addition, costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws or regulations, or similar rules, are expanded or changed. Costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or other restrictions. Many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the cost for their products or their demand for the Registrants' services. Increased capital and operating costs are subject to rate recovery. PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future environmental or rate proceedings before regulatory authorities.\nSee Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the more significant environmental matters including: Legal Matters, NAAQS, Climate Change, CCRs, and ELGs. See \"Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures\" in \"Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for information on projected environmental capital expenditures for 2018 through 2022. See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for information related to the impacts of CCRs on AROs.\nSustainability\nIncreasing attention has been focused on a broad range of corporate activities under the heading of sustainability\u201d, which has resulted in a significant increase in the number of requests from interested parties for information on sustainability topics. These parties range from investor groups focused on environmental, social, governance and other matters to non-investors concerned with a variety of public policy matters. Often the scope of the information sought is very broad and not necessarily relevant to an issuer's business or industry. As a result, a number of private groups have proposed to standardize the subject matter constituting sustainability, either generally or by industry. Those efforts remain ongoing. In addition, certain of these private groups have advocated that the SEC promulgate regulations requiring specific sustainability reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the '34 Act\u201d), or that issuers voluntarily include certain sustainability disclosure in their '34 Act reports. To date, no new reporting requirements have been adopted or proposed by the SEC.\nAs has been PPL's practice, to the extent sustainability issues have or may have a material impact on the Registrants' financial condition or results of operation, PPL discloses such matters in accordance with applicable securities law and SEC regulations. With respect to other sustainability topics that PPL deems relevant to investors but that are not required to be reported under applicable securities law and SEC regulation, PPL will continue each spring to publish its annual sustainability report and post that report on its corporate website at www.pplweb.com and on www.pplsustainability.com. Neither the information in such annual sustainability report nor the information at such websites is incorporated in this Form 10-K by reference, and it should not be considered a part of this Form 10-K. In preparing its sustainability report, PPL is guided by the framework established by the Global Reporting Initiative, which identifies environmental, social, governance and other subject matter categories, together with recent efforts by the Edison Electric Institute to provide guidance as to the appropriate subset of sustainability information that can be applied consistently across the electric utility industry.\nCybersecurity\nSee Cybersecurity Management\u201d in Item 1. Business\u201d and Item 1A. Risk factors\u201d for a discussion of cybersecurity risks affecting the Registrants and the related strategies for managing these risks.\nCompetition\nSee \"Competition\" under each of PPL's reportable segments in \"Item 1. Business - General - Segment Information\" and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of competitive factors affecting the Registrants.\nNew Accounting Guidance\nSee Note 21 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting guidance pending adoption.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nFinancial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. The following accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of the reported financial condition or results of operations and require management to make estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the Financial Statements (these accounting policies are also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements). Senior management has reviewed with PPL's Audit Committee these critical accounting policies, the following disclosures regarding their application, and the estimates and assumptions regarding them.\nDefined Benefits\n(All Registrants)\nCertain of the Registrants and/or their subsidiaries sponsor or participate in, as applicable, certain qualified funded and non-qualified unfunded defined benefit pension plans and both funded and unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. These plans are applicable to the majority of the Registrants' employees (based on eligibility for their applicable plans). The Registrants and certain of their subsidiaries record an asset or liability to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to AOCI or, in the case of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU, regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. Consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans is fully recognized on the Balance Sheets. See Notes 6 and 11 to the Financial Statements for additional information about the plans and the accounting for defined benefits.\nA summary of plan sponsors by Registrant and whether a Registrant or its subsidiaries sponsor (S) or participate in and receives allocations (P) from those plans is shown in the table below.\nTable 387: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plan Sponsor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PPL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PPL Electric\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LKE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LG&E\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>KU\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PPL Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>S\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WPD (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>S\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LKE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>S\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LG&E\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>S\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 388: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Does not sponsor or participate in other postretirement benefits plans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement makes certain assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. As such, annual net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings or regulatory assets based on estimated results. Any differences between actual and estimated results are recorded in AOCI, or in the case of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU, regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. These amounts in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized to income over future periods. The delayed recognition allows for a smoothed recognition of costs over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans. The primary assumptions are:\nTable 389: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Discount Rate - The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future.

In addition, at December 31, 2017, the plan sponsors updated the basis for estimating projected mortality improvements and selected the MP-2017 improvement scale for all U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. This new mortality assumption reflects the expectation of lower ongoing improvements in life expectancies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 394: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>U.K. - at March 31 2016, the U.K. plan sponsors adopted the new mortality assumptions based on the SAPS S2 All\u201d tables issued by the Self-Administered Pensions Schemes' (SAPS) study for all U.K. defined benefit pension plans. In addition, the U.K. plan sponsors updated the basis for estimating projected mortality improvements and selected the CMI 2015 Core Projections model published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation study with a long-term future improvement rate of 1% for all U.K. defined benefit pension plans. These new mortality assumptions reflect the impact of the most recently available actual scheme mortality data (which has been higher than previously expected) on both current life expectancies and the expectation of continuing improvements in life expectancies. The use of the new base tables and improvement scale resulted in a decrease to U.K. defined benefit pension obligations, a decrease to future expense and an increase to funded status.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(PPL)\nIn selecting the discount rate for its U.K. pension plans, WPD starts with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for its plans. These plan-specific cash flows are matched against a spot-rate yield curve to determine the assumed discount rate. The spot-rate yield curve uses an iBoxx British pounds sterling denominated corporate bond index as its base. From this base, those bonds with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop an appropriate subset of bonds. Historically, WPD used the single weighted-average discount rate derived from the spot rates used to discount the benefit obligation. Concurrent with the annual remeasurement of plan assets and obligations at December 31, 2015, WPD began using individual spot rates to measure service cost and interest cost beginning with the calculation of 2016 net periodic defined benefit cost.\nAn individual bond matching approach, which is used for the U.S. pension plans as discussed below, is not used for the U.K. pension plans because the universe of bonds in the U.K. is not deep enough to adequately support such an approach.\n(All Registrants)\nIn selecting the discount rates for U.S. defined benefit plans, the plan sponsors start with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for their plans. The plan-specific cash flows are matched against the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. This bond matching process begins with the full universe of Aa-rated non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds, serving as the base from which those with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop an appropriate subset of bonds. Individual bonds are then selected based on the timing of each plan's cash flows and parameters are established as to the percentage of each individual bond issue that could be hypothetically purchased and the surplus reinvestment rates to be assumed.\nTo determine the expected return on plan assets, plan sponsors project the long-term rates of return on plan assets using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class. Each plan's specific current and expected asset allocations are also considered in developing a reasonable return assumption.\nIn selecting a rate of compensation increase, plan sponsors consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates.\nThe following table provides the weighted-average assumptions selected for discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase at December 31 used to measure current year obligations and subsequent year net periodic defined benefit costs under GAAP, as applicable.\nTable 395: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumption / Registrant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension - PPL (U.S.)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension - PPL (U.K.) Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension - PPL (U.K.) Service Cost (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.73\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension - PPL (U.K.) Interest Cost (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension - LKE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension - LG&E\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Postretirement - PPL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Postretirement - LKE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension - PPL (U.S.)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension - PPL (U.K.)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension - LKE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension - LG&E\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Postretirement - PPL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Postretirement - LKE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension - PPL (U.S.)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.95\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension - PPL (U.K.)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension - LKE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Postretirement - PPL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.92\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Postretirement - LKE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 396: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>WPD began using individual spot rates from the yield curve used to discount the benefit obligation to measure service cost and interest cost for the calculation of net periodic defined benefit cost in 2016.

their December 31, 2017 financial statements. The Registrants continue to evaluate the application of the TCJA and have used significant management judgment to make certain assumptions concerning the application of various components of the law in the calculation of 2017 income tax expense. The current and deferred components of the income tax expense calculations that the Registrants consider provisional due to uncertainty either with respect to the technical application of the law or the quantification of the impact of the law include (but are not limited to): tax depreciation, deductible executive compensation, and the accumulated foreign earnings used to calculate the deemed dividend included in PPL's taxable income in 2017 along with the impact of associated foreign tax credits and related valuation allowances. The Registrants believe that classification of these items as provisional is appropriate. The Registrants have accounted for these items based on their interpretation of the TCJA.\nFurther interpretive guidance on the TCJA from the IRS, Treasury, the Joint Committee on Taxation through its \"Blue Book\" or from Congress in the form of Technical Corrections may differ from the Registrants' interpretation of the TCJA.\nSignificant management judgment is also required in developing the Registrants' provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and whether the undistributed earnings of WPD are considered indefinitely reinvested.\nSignificant management judgment is required to determine the amount of benefit recognized related to an uncertain tax position. Tax positions are evaluated following a two-step process. The first step requires an entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax position will be sustained. This determination assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position. The second step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion. The benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of realization, upon settlement, that exceeds 50%. Management considers a number of factors in assessing the benefit to be recognized, including negotiation of a settlement.\nOn a quarterly basis, uncertain tax positions are reassessed by considering information known as of the reporting date. Based on management's assessment of new information, a tax benefit may subsequently be recognized for a previously unrecognized tax position, a previously recognized tax position may be derecognized, or the benefit of a previously recognized tax position may be remeasured. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements in the future. Unrecognized tax benefits are classified as current to the extent management expects to settle an uncertain tax position by payment or receipt of cash within one year of the reporting date.\nAt December 31, 2017, no significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits are projected over the next 12 months.\nThe need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also requires significant management judgment. Valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. Management considers a number of factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Any tax planning strategy utilized in this assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria utilized to account for an uncertain tax position. Management also considers the uncertainty posed by political risk and the effect of this uncertainty on the various factors that management takes into account in evaluating the need for valuation allowances. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.\nSee Note 5 to the Financial Statements for income tax disclosures, including the impact of the TCJA and management's conclusion that the undistributed earnings of WPD are considered indefinitely reinvested. Based on this conclusion, PPL Global does not record U.S. federal income taxes on WPD's undistributed earnings.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\n(All Registrants)\nPPL Electric, LG&E and KU, are subject to cost-based rate regulation. As a result, the effects of regulatory actions are required to be reflected in the financial statements. Assets and liabilities are recorded that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in regulated customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose.\nManagement continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. Based on this continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery. This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels, and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs\nceases to be probable, the regulatory asset would be written-off. Additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of recovery of regulatory assets.\nSee Note 6 to the Financial Statements for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities recorded at December 31, 2017 and 2016, as well as additional information on those regulatory assets and liabilities. All regulatory assets are either currently being recovered under specific rate orders, represent amounts that are expected to be recovered in future rates or benefit future periods based upon established regulatory practices.\n(PPL)\nWPD operates in an incentive-based regulatory structure under distribution licenses granted by Ofgem. As the regulatory model is incentive-based rather than a cost recovery model, WPD is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP for entities subject to cost-based rate regulation. Therefore, the accounting treatment of adjustments to base demand revenue and/or allowed revenue is primarily evaluated based on revenue recognition guidance. See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\nPrice Risk Management (PPL)\nSee \"Financial Condition - Risk Management\" above, as well as \"Price Risk Management\" in Note 1 to the Financial Statements.\nGoodwill Impairment (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. PPL has determined its reporting units to be at the same level as its reportable segments. LKE, LG&E and KU are individually single operating and reportable segments. A goodwill impairment test is performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit may be greater than the reporting unit's fair value. Additionally, goodwill is tested for impairment after a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed of.\nPPL, LKE, LG&E and KU may elect either to initially make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill for impairment using a two-step quantitative test. If the qualitative evaluation (referred to as \"step zero\") is elected and the assessment results in a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the two-step quantitative impairment test is not necessary.\nWhen the two-step quantitative impairment test is elected or required as a result of the step zero assessment, in step one, PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU determine whether a potential impairment exists by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill, on the measurement date. If the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.\nThe second step of the quantitative test requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill, which is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill in a business combination. That is, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The excess of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill.\nPPL's goodwill was $3.3 billion at December 31, 2017, which consists of $2.6 billion related to the acquisition of WPD and $662 million related to the acquisition of LKE. PPL (for its U.K. Regulated and Kentucky Regulated segments), and individually, LKE, LG&E and KU elected to perform the qualitative step zero evaluation of goodwill, as of October 1, 2017. These evaluations considered the excess of fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit that was calculated during step one of the quantitative impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2015, and the relevant events and circumstances that occurred since those tests were performed including:\nTable 403: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>current year financial performance versus the prior year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 404: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in planned capital expenditures;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 405: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the consistency of forecasted free cash flows;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 406: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>earnings quality and sustainability;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 407: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in market participant discount rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 408: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in long-term growth rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 409: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in PPL's market capitalization; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 410: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the overall economic and regulatory environments in which these regulated entities operate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on these evaluations, management concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their carrying values. As such, the two-step quantitative impairment test was not performed.\nAsset Retirement Obligations (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nARO liabilities are required to be recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. The initial obligation is measured at its estimated fair value. An ARO must be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated. An equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset. For LKE, LG&E and KU, all ARO accretion and depreciation expenses are reclassified as a regulatory asset. ARO regulatory assets associated with certain CCR projects are amortized to expense in accordance with regulatory approvals. For other AROs, at the time of retirement, the related ARO regulatory asset is offset against the associated cost of removal regulatory liability, PP&E and ARO liability.\nSee Note 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information on AROs.\nIn determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value. Fair value is developed using an expected present value technique based on assumptions of market participants that consider estimated retirement costs in current period dollars that are inflated to the anticipated retirement date and then discounted back to the date the ARO was incurred. Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value of AROs could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements. Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the latest estimate of the ARO. Any change to the capitalized asset, positive or negative, is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset.\nAt December 31, 2017, the total recorded balances and information on the most significant recorded AROs were as follows. Table 411: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Most Significant AROs\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\nARO\nRecorded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\nRecorded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Description\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PPL\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ponds, landfills and natural gas mains\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LKE\n</td> <td>356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ponds, landfills and natural gas mains\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LG&E\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ponds, landfills and natural gas mains\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KU\n</td> <td>235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ponds and landfills\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe most significant assumptions surrounding AROs are the forecasted retirement costs (including the settlement dates and the timing of cash flows), the discount rates and the inflation rates. At December 31, 2017, a 10% increase to retirement cost would increase these ARO liabilities by $32 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase these ARO liabilities by $4 million and a 0.25% increase in the inflation rate would increase these ARO liabilities by $2 million. There would be no significant change to the annual depreciation expense of the ARO asset or the annual accretion expense of the ARO liability as a result of these changes in assumptions.\nRevenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenues (LKE, LG&E and KU)\nRevenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual meter reads taken throughout the month, estimates are recorded for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. For LG&E and KU, such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of deliveries to customers since the date of the last reading of their meters. The unbilled revenue estimates reflect consideration of factors including daily load models, estimated usage for each customer class, the effect of current and different rate schedules, the meter read schedule, the billing schedule, actual weather data and where applicable, the impact of\nweather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures. See \"Unbilled revenues\" on the Registrants' Balance Sheets for balances at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nOther Information (All Registrants)\nPPL's Audit Committee has approved the independent auditor to provide audit and audit-related services, tax services and other services permitted by Sarbanes-Oxley and SEC rules.

Business.\"\nBusiness Strategy\n(All Registrants)\nFollowing the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, PPL completed its strategic transformation to a fully regulated business model operating seven diverse, high-performing utilities. These utilities are located in the U.K., Pennsylvania and Kentucky and each jurisdiction has different regulatory structures and customer classes. The Company believes this diverse portfolio provides strong earnings and dividend growth potential that will create significant value for its shareowners and positions PPL well for continued growth and success.\nPPL's businesses of WPD, PPL Electric, LG&E and KU plan to achieve growth by providing efficient, reliable and safe operations and strong customer service, maintaining constructive regulatory relationships and achieving timely recovery of costs. These businesses are expected to achieve strong, long-term growth in rate base in the U.S. and RAV in the U.K., driven by planned significant capital expenditures to maintain existing assets and improve system reliability and, for LKE, LG&E and\nKU, to comply with federal and state environmental regulations related to coal-fired electricity generation facilities. Additionally, significant transmission rate base growth is expected through at least 2020 at PPL Electric.\nFor the U.S. businesses, our strategy is to recover capital project costs efficiently through various rate-making mechanisms, including periodic base rate case proceedings using forward test years, annual FERC formula rate mechanisms and other regulatory agency-approved recovery mechanisms designed to limit regulatory lag. In Kentucky, the KPSC has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ECR, DSM, GLT, fuel adjustment clause, gas supply clause and recovery on construction work-in-progress) that reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. In addition, the KPSC requires a utility to obtain a CPCN prior to constructing a facility, unless the construction is an ordinary extension of existing facilities in the usual course of business or does not involve sufficient capital outlay to materially affect the utility's financial condition. Although such KPSC proceedings do not directly address cost recovery issues, the KPSC, in awarding a CPCN, concludes that the public convenience and necessity require the construction of the facility on the basis that the facility is the lowest reasonable cost alternative to address the need. In Pennsylvania, the FERC transmission formula rate, DSIC mechanism, Smart Meter Rider and other recovery mechanisms are in place to reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs.\nRate base growth in the domestic utilities is expected to result in earnings growth for the foreseeable future. In 2017, earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment declined mainly due to the unfavorable impact of lower GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rates. RAV growth is expected in the U.K. Regulated segment during the RIIO-ED1 price control period which ends on March 31, 2023 and to result in earnings growth in 2018 through at least 2020. See \"Item 1. Business - Segment Information - U.K. Regulated Segment\" for additional information on RIIO-ED1.\nTo manage financing costs and access to credit markets, and to fund capital expenditures, a key objective of the Registrants is to maintain their investment grade credit ratings and adequate liquidity positions. In addition, the Registrants have financial and operational risk management programs that, among other things, are designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility, as applicable, related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and counterparty credit quality. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and swaps. See \"Financial Condition - Risk Management\" below for further information.\nEarnings generated by PPL's U.K. subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency translation risk. Because WPD's earnings represent such a significant portion of PPL's consolidated earnings, PPL enters into foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the value of the GBP versus the U.S. dollar. These hedges do not receive hedge accounting treatment under GAAP. See \"Financial and Operational Developments - U.K. Membership in European Union\" for additional discussion of the U.K. earnings hedging activity.\nThe U.K. subsidiaries also have currency exposure to the U.S. dollar to the extent of their U.S. dollar denominated debt. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and cross-currency swaps that contain characteristics of both interest rate and foreign currency exchange contracts.\nAs discussed above, a key component of this strategy is to maintain constructive relationships with regulators in all jurisdictions in which we operate (U.K., U.S. federal and state). This is supported by our strong culture of integrity and delivering on commitments to customers, regulators and shareowners, and a commitment to continue to improve our customer service, reliability and operational efficiency.\nFinancial and Operational Developments\nU.S. Tax Reform (All Registrants)\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the TCJA. Substantially all of the provisions of the TCJA are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The TCJA includes significant changes to the taxation of corporations, including provisions specifically applicable to regulated public utilities. The more significant changes that impact the Registrants are:\n \u2022 The reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, effective January 1, 2018; \n \u2022 The exclusion from U.S. federal taxable income of dividends from foreign subsidiaries and the associated \"transition tax;\" \n \u2022 Limitations on the tax deductibility of interest expense, with an exception to these limitations for regulated public utilities; \n \u2022 Full current year expensing of capital expenditures with an exception for regulated public utilities that qualify for the exception to the interest expense limitation; and \n \u2022 The continuation of certain rate normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits. For non-regulated businesses, the TCJA generally provides for full expensing of property acquired after September 27, 2017. \nAs a result, PPL expects cash flows at its domestic utilities to decline as the benefit of the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate is passed through to its utility customers. In addition, as PPL is not a current federal tax payer because of available net operating loss carry forwards, there is no immediate corporate cash benefit associated with the lower tax rate. The lack of cash benefit resulted in degradation of PPL's projected financial credit metrics. In an effort to maintain its current credit rating, PPL, among other things, currently plans to issue about $1 billion of equity in 2018. This compares to PPL's actual 2017 equity issuances of $482 million.\nThe changes enacted by the TCJA were recorded as an adjustment to the Registrants' deferred tax provision, and have been reflected in \"Income Taxes\" on the Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017 as follows:\n\nThe components of these adjustments are discussed below:\nReduction of U.S. Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate\nAt the date of enactment, the Registrants' deferred taxes were remeasured based upon the new U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 21%. For PPL's regulated entities, the changes in deferred taxes were, in large part, recorded as an offset to either a regulatory asset or regulatory liability and will be reflected in future rates charged to customers. The rate reduction on non-regulated deferred tax assets and liabilities were recorded as an adjustment to the Registrants' deferred tax provision, and have been reflected in \"Income Taxes\" on the Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017 as follows:\n\nFor PPL's U.S. regulated operations, reductions in accumulated deferred income tax balances due to the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% under the provisions of the TCJA may result in amounts previously collected from utility customers for these deferred taxes to be refundable to such customers over a period of time. The TCJA includes provisions that stipulate how these excess deferred taxes are to be passed back to customers for certain accelerated tax depreciation benefits. Potential refunds of other deferred taxes will be determined by the Registrants' regulators. The Balance Sheets at December 31, 2017 reflect the increase to the Registrants' net regulatory liabilities as a result of the TCJA as follows:\n\nTransition Tax\nThe TCJA included a conversion from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, effective January 1, 2018. In the transition to the territorial regime, a one-time transition tax was imposed on PPL's unrepatriated accumulated foreign earnings in 2017. These earnings were treated as a taxable deemed dividend to PPL of approximately $462 million. As the PPL consolidated U.S. group had a taxable loss for 2017, inclusive of the taxable deemed dividend, the foreign tax credits associated with the deemed dividend were recorded as a deferred tax asset. However, it is expected that under the TCJA, the current and prior year foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be fully realizable.\nAs a result, the net deferred income tax expense impact of the deemed repatriation was $101 million and was recorded in \"Income Taxes\" on the PPL Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017 and \"Deferred tax liabilities\" on the PPL Balance Sheet at December 31, 2017.\nSee Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\nU.K. Membership in European Union (PPL)\nOn March 29, 2017, the U.K. formally notified the European Council of the European Union (EU) of its intent to withdraw from the EU, thereby commencing the two-year negotiation period to establish the terms of that withdrawal under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Article 50 specifies that if a member state decides to withdraw from the EU, it must notify the European\nCouncil of its intention to leave the EU, negotiate the terms of withdrawal and establish the legal grounds for its future relationship with the EU. Article 50 provides two years from the date of the Article 50 notification to conclude negotiations. Failure to complete negotiations within two years, unless negotiations are extended, would result in the treaties governing the EU no longer being applicable to the U.K. with there being no agreement in place governing the U.K.'s relationship with the EU. Under the terms of Article 50, negotiations can only be extended beyond two years if all of the 27 remaining EU states agree to an extension. Any withdrawal agreement will need to be approved by both the European Council and the European Parliament. There remains significant uncertainty as to the ultimate outcome of the withdrawal negotiations and the related impact on the U.K. economy and the GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rate.\nPPL has executed hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange risk to the Company's U.K. earnings. As of February 20, 2018, PPL's foreign exchange exposure related to budgeted earnings is 100% hedged for the remainder of 2018 at an average rate of $1.34 per GBP, 100% hedged for 2019 at an average rate of $1.39 per GBP and 35% hedged for 2020 at an average rate of $1.46 per GBP.\nPPL cannot predict either the short-term or long-term impact to foreign exchange rates or long-term impact on PPL's financial condition that may be experienced as a result of the actions taken by the U.K. government to withdraw from the EU, although such impacts could be significant.\nRegulatory Requirements\n(All Registrants)\nThe Registrants cannot predict the impact that future regulatory requirements may have on their financial condition or results of operations.\n(PPL)\nRIIO-2 Framework Review\nIn July 2017, Ofgem published an open letter commencing its RIIO-2 framework review, which covers all U.K. gas and electricity, transmission and distribution price controls. The purpose of this framework review is to build on lessons learned from the current price controls and to develop a framework that will be adaptable to meeting the needs of an evolving U.K. energy sector.\nThe letter sets out the context for the development of the next price controls, RIIO-2, and seeks views from stakeholders on the RIIO-2 framework. Responses to the open letter were published in September 2017 and will be used to guide the full RIIO-2 framework consultation which is expected to be published in March of 2018. The promulgation of sector specific price controls will begin with the gas and electricity transmission networks, with electricity distribution price control work scheduled to begin in 2020, at which time Ofgem plans to publish its RIIO-ED2 strategy consultation document.\nThe current electricity distribution price control, RIIO-ED1, continues through March 31, 2023 and will not be impacted by this RIIO-2 consultation process. PPL cannot predict the outcome of this process or the long-term impact it or the final RIIO-ED2 regulations will have on its financial condition or results of operations.\nRIIO-ED1 Mid-period Review\nIn December 2017, Ofgem initiated a consultation on a potential RIIO-ED1 mid-period review (MPR). The RIIO framework allows for a MPR of outputs halfway through the price control. Ofgem is consulting on three potential approaches:\n \u2022 whether to implement a MPR as currently defined; \n \u2022 whether to implement a MPR with an extension for WPD rail electrification; and \n \u2022 whether to implement a MPR with a significant extension of scope to include financial parameters. \nOfgem's initial assessment as set forth in its December 2017 consultation publication is that a MPR as currently defined under RIIO-ED1 is not required. In addition, Ofgem recognized that the rail electrification is outside the scope of the MPR and that implementing a MPR to include financial parameters could undermine the stability of the regulatory regime. The consultation, however, requests interested party comments on those conclusions. The period for submission of comments to the consultation closed on February 2, 2018. Formal consultation responses have been submitted by PPL and WPD. A decision on whether to\nproceed with a MPR is expected in spring 2018. If Ofgem decides to launch a MPR, it will consult on detailed proposals in summer 2018 and any associated changes to DNO licenses would be in place by April 1, 2019. Although, PPL cannot predict the outcome of the consultation process, a MPR is not expected to have a significant impact on PPL's financial condition or results of operations.\n(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nThe businesses of LKE, LG&E and KU are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to CCRs, GHG, ELGs and the Clean Power Plan. See Note 6, Note 13 and Note 19 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these significant environmental matters. These and other stringent environmental requirements led PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU to retire approximately 800 MW of coal-fired generating plants in Kentucky, primarily in 2015. Additionally, KU anticipates retiring two older coal-fired units at the E.W. Brown plant in 2019 with a combined summer rating capacity of 272 MW.\nAlso as a result of the environmental requirements discussed above, LKE projects $828 million ($335 million at LG&E and $493 million at KU) in environmental capital investment over the next five years. See PPL's \"Financial Condition - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures\", Note 6 and Note 13 for additional information.\nRate Case Proceedings\n(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nIn November 2016, LG&E and KU filed requests with the KPSC for increases in annual base electricity and gas rates. LG&E's and KU's applications included requests for CPCNs for implementing an Advanced Metering System program and a Distribution Automation program.\nIn April and May 2017, LG&E and KU, along with all intervening parties to the proceeding, filed with the KPSC, stipulation and recommendation agreements (stipulations) resolving all issues with the parties. Among other things, the proposed stipulations provided for increases in annual revenue requirements associated with LG&E base electricity rates of $59 million, LG&E base gas rates of $8 million and KU base electricity rates of $55 million, reflecting a return on equity of 9.75%, the withdrawal of LG&E's and KU's request for a CPCN for the Advanced Metering System and other changes to the revenue requirements, which dealt primarily with the timing of cost recovery, including depreciation rates.\nIn June 2017, the KPSC issued orders approving, with certain modifications, the proposed stipulations filed in April and May 2017. The orders modified the stipulations to provide for increases in annual revenue requirements associated with LG&E base electricity rates of $57 million, LG&E base gas rates of $7 million, KU base electricity rates of $52 million and incorporated an authorized return on equity of 9.7%. Consistent with the stipulations, the orders approved LG&E's and KU's request for implementing a Distribution Automation program and their withdrawal of a request for a CPCN for the Advanced Metering System program. The orders also approved new depreciation rates for LG&E and KU that resulted in higher depreciation of approximately $15 million ($4 million for LG&E and $11 million for KU) in 2017, exclusive of net additions to PP&E. The orders resulted in base electricity and gas rate increases of 5.2% and 2.1% at LG&E and a base electricity rate increase of 3.2% at KU. The new base rates and all elements of the orders became effective July 1, 2017. On June 23, 2017, the KPSC issued orders establishing an authorized return on equity of 9.7% for all of LG&E's and KU's existing approved ECR plans and projects, replacing the prior authorized return on equity levels of 9.8% for CCR projects and 10% for all other ECR approved projects, effective with bills issued in August 2017. The annual impact of the new authorized return for ECR projects is not expected to be significant.\n(LKE and KU)\nOn September 29, 2017, KU filed a request seeking approval from the VSCC to increase annual Virginia base electricity revenue by $7 million, representing an increase of 10.4%. KU's request is based on an authorized 10.42% return on equity. Subject to regulatory review and approval, new rates would become effective July 1, 2018.\n(PPL, LKE and KU)\nIn October 2016, KU filed a request with the FERC to modify its formula rates to provide for the recovery of CCR impoundment closure costs from its departing municipal customers. In December 2016, the FERC accepted the revised rate schedules providing recovery of the costs effective December 31, 2016, subject to refund, and established limited hearing and settlement judge procedures relating to determining the applicable amortization period. In March 2017, the parties reached a\nsettlement in principle regarding a suitable amortization period. In June 2017, a FERC judge issued an order implementing the settlement's rates on an interim basis, effective July 1, 2017. In August 2017, the FERC issued a final order approving the settlement.\nTCJA Impact on LG&E and KU Rates (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nOn December 21, 2017, Kentucky Industrial Utility Customers, Inc. submitted a complaint with the KPSC against LG&E and KU, as well as other utility companies in Kentucky, alleging that their respective rates would no longer be fair, just and reasonable following the enactment of the TCJA reducing the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The complaint requested the KPSC to issue an order requiring LG&E and KU to begin deferring, as of January 1, 2018, the revenue requirement effect of all income tax expense savings resulting from the federal corporate income tax reduction, including the amortization of excess deferred income taxes by recording those savings in a regulatory liability account and establishing a process by which the federal corporate income tax savings will be passed back to customers.\nOn December 27, 2017, as a result of the complaint, the KPSC ordered LG&E and KU to satisfy or address the complaint and commence recording regulatory liabilities to reflect the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate to 21% and the associated savings in excess deferred taxes on an interim basis until utility rates are adjusted to reflect the federal tax savings.\nOn January 8, 2018, LG&E and KU responded to the complaint, denying certain claims in the complaint but concurring that the TCJA will result in savings for their customers. LG&E and KU have stated in their responses that the companies have recorded regulatory liabilities as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate and the associated savings in excess deferred taxes and will make changes to their ECR, DSM and LG&E's GLT rate mechanisms to begin providing the applicable savings to customers. LG&E and KU also offered to establish a new bill credit mechanism effective with the April 2018 billing cycle to begin distributing the tax savings associated with base rates to customers.\nOn January 29, 2018, LG&E and KU reached a settlement agreement to commence returning savings related to the TCJA to their customers. The savings will be distributed through their ECR, DSM and LG&E's GLT rate mechanisms beginning in March 2018 and through a new bill credit mechanism from April 1, 2018 through April 30, 2019. The estimated impact of the rate reduction represents approximately $91 million in KU electricity revenues, $69 million in LG&E electricity revenues and $17 million in LG&E gas revenues for the period January 2018 through April 2019. Ongoing tax savings are expected to also be addressed in LG&E's and KU's next Kentucky base rate case. LG&E and KU have indicated their intent to file an application for base rate changes during 2018 to be effective during spring 2019. The settlement agreement is subject to review and approval by the KPSC. An order in the proceeding may occur during the first quarter of 2018.\nAdditionally, on January 8, 2018, the VSCC ordered KU, as well as other utilities in Virginia, to accrue regulatory liabilities reflecting the Virginia jurisdictional revenue requirement impacts of the reduced federal corporate tax rate.\nThe FERC has not issued any guidance on the effect on rates of the TCJA.\nLG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.\nTCJA Impact on PPL Electric Rates (PPL and PPL Electric)\nThe PUC issued a Secretarial Letter on February 12, 2018 regarding the TCJA. The Commission is requesting comments from interested parties addressing whether the Commission should adjust current customer rates to reflect the reduced federal income tax expense and, if so, the appropriate negative surcharge or other methodology that would permit immediate adjustment to consumer rates, and whether the surcharge or other said methodology should provide that any refunds to customers due to reduced taxes be effective as of January 1, 2018. In addition, the Secretarial Letter requests certain Pennsylvania regulated utilities, including PPL Electric, to provide certain data related to the effect of the TCJA on PPL Electric's income tax expense and rate base including whether any of the potential tax savings from the reduced federal corporate tax rate can be used for purposes other than to reduce customer rates. PPL Electric's responses are due to the PUC not later than March 9, 2018.\nThe FERC has not issued any guidance on the effect on rates of the TCJA.\nDiscontinued Operations (PPL)\nThe operations of PPL's Supply segment prior to its June 1, 2015 spinoff are included in \"Loss from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes)\" on the 2015 Statement of Income.\nSee Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information related to the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, including the components of Discontinued Operations.\nResults of Operations\n(PPL)\nThe \"Statement of Income Analysis\" discussion below describes significant changes in principal line items on PPL's Statements of Income, comparing year-to-year changes.

Business.\"\nBusiness Strategy\n(All Registrants)\nFollowing the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, PPL completed its strategic transformation to a fully regulated business model operating seven diverse, high-performing utilities. These utilities are located in the U.K., Pennsylvania and Kentucky and each jurisdiction has different regulatory structures and customer classes. The Company believes this diverse portfolio provides strong earnings and dividend growth potential that will create significant value for its shareowners and positions PPL well for continued growth and success.\nPPL's businesses of WPD, PPL Electric, LG&E and KU plan to achieve growth by providing efficient, reliable and safe operations and strong customer service, maintaining constructive regulatory relationships and achieving timely recovery of costs. These businesses are expected to achieve strong, long-term growth in rate base in the U.S. and RAV in the U.K., driven by planned significant capital expenditures to maintain existing assets and improve system reliability and, for LKE, LG&E and\nKU, to comply with federal and state environmental regulations related to coal-fired electricity generation facilities. Additionally, significant transmission rate base growth is expected through at least 2020 at PPL Electric.\nFor the U.S. businesses, our strategy is to recover capital project costs efficiently through various rate-making mechanisms, including periodic base rate case proceedings using forward test years, annual FERC formula rate mechanisms and other regulatory agency-approved recovery mechanisms designed to limit regulatory lag. In Kentucky, the KPSC has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ECR, DSM, GLT, fuel adjustment clause, gas supply clause and recovery on construction work-in-progress) that reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. In addition, the KPSC requires a utility to obtain a CPCN prior to constructing a facility, unless the construction is an ordinary extension of existing facilities in the usual course of business or does not involve sufficient capital outlay to materially affect the utility's financial condition. Although such KPSC proceedings do not directly address cost recovery issues, the KPSC, in awarding a CPCN, concludes that the public convenience and necessity require the construction of the facility on the basis that the facility is the lowest reasonable cost alternative to address the need. In Pennsylvania, the FERC transmission formula rate, DSIC mechanism, Smart Meter Rider and other recovery mechanisms are in place to reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs.\nRate base growth in the domestic utilities is expected to result in earnings growth for the foreseeable future. In 2017, earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment declined mainly due to the unfavorable impact of lower GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rates. RAV growth is expected in the U.K. Regulated segment during the RIIO-ED1 price control period which ends on March 31, 2023 and to result in earnings growth in 2018 through at least 2020. See \"Item 1. Business - Segment Information - U.K. Regulated Segment\" for additional information on RIIO-ED1.\nTo manage financing costs and access to credit markets, and to fund capital expenditures, a key objective of the Registrants is to maintain their investment grade credit ratings and adequate liquidity positions. In addition, the Registrants have financial and operational risk management programs that, among other things, are designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility, as applicable, related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and counterparty credit quality. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and swaps. See \"Financial Condition - Risk Management\" below for further information.\nEarnings generated by PPL's U.K. subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency translation risk. Because WPD's earnings represent such a significant portion of PPL's consolidated earnings, PPL enters into foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the value of the GBP versus the U.S. dollar. These hedges do not receive hedge accounting treatment under GAAP. See \"Financial and Operational Developments - U.K. Membership in European Union\" for additional discussion of the U.K. earnings hedging activity.\nThe U.K. subsidiaries also have currency exposure to the U.S. dollar to the extent of their U.S. dollar denominated debt. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and cross-currency swaps that contain characteristics of both interest rate and foreign currency exchange contracts.\nAs discussed above, a key component of this strategy is to maintain constructive relationships with regulators in all jurisdictions in which we operate (U.K., U.S. federal and state). This is supported by our strong culture of integrity and delivering on commitments to customers, regulators and shareowners, and a commitment to continue to improve our customer service, reliability and operational efficiency.\nFinancial and Operational Developments\nU.S. Tax Reform (All Registrants)\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the TCJA. Substantially all of the provisions of the TCJA are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The TCJA includes significant changes to the taxation of corporations, including provisions specifically applicable to regulated public utilities. The more significant changes that impact the Registrants are:\n \u2022 The reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, effective January 1, 2018; \n \u2022 The exclusion from U.S. federal taxable income of dividends from foreign subsidiaries and the associated \"transition tax;\" \n \u2022 Limitations on the tax deductibility of interest expense, with an exception to these limitations for regulated public utilities; \n \u2022 Full current year expensing of capital expenditures with an exception for regulated public utilities that qualify for the exception to the interest expense limitation; and \n \u2022 The continuation of certain rate normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits. For non-regulated businesses, the TCJA generally provides for full expensing of property acquired after September 27, 2017. \nAs a result, PPL expects cash flows at its domestic utilities to decline as the benefit of the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate is passed through to its utility customers. In addition, as PPL is not a current federal tax payer because of available net operating loss carry forwards, there is no immediate corporate cash benefit associated with the lower tax rate. The lack of cash benefit resulted in degradation of PPL's projected financial credit metrics. In an effort to maintain its current credit rating, PPL, among other things, currently plans to issue about $1 billion of equity in 2018. This compares to PPL's actual 2017 equity issuances of $482 million.\nThe changes enacted by the TCJA were recorded as an adjustment to the Registrants' deferred tax provision, and have been reflected in \"Income Taxes\" on the Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017 as follows:\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>PPL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PPL Electric\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LKE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LG&E\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>KU\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe components of these adjustments are discussed below:\nReduction of U.S. Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate\nAt the date of enactment, the Registrants' deferred taxes were remeasured based upon the new U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 21%. For PPL's regulated entities, the changes in deferred taxes were, in large part, recorded as an offset to either a regulatory asset or regulatory liability and will be reflected in future rates charged to customers. The rate reduction on non-regulated deferred tax assets and liabilities were recorded as an adjustment to the Registrants' deferred tax provision, and have been reflected in \"Income Taxes\" on the Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017 as follows:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>PPL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PPL Electric\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LKE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LG&E\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>KU\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor PPL's U.S. regulated operations, reductions in accumulated deferred income tax balances due to the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% under the provisions of the TCJA may result in amounts previously collected from utility customers for these deferred taxes to be refundable to such customers over a period of time. The TCJA includes provisions that stipulate how these excess deferred taxes are to be passed back to customers for certain accelerated tax depreciation benefits. Potential refunds of other deferred taxes will be determined by the Registrants' regulators. The Balance Sheets at December 31, 2017 reflect the increase to the Registrants' net regulatory liabilities as a result of the TCJA as follows:\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>PPL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PPL Electric\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LKE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LG&E\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>KU\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Increase in Regulatory Liabilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>634\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTransition Tax\nThe TCJA included a conversion from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, effective January 1, 2018. In the transition to the territorial regime, a one-time transition tax was imposed on PPL's unrepatriated accumulated foreign earnings in 2017. These earnings were treated as a taxable deemed dividend to PPL of approximately $462 million. As the PPL consolidated U.S. group had a taxable loss for 2017, inclusive of the taxable deemed dividend, the foreign tax credits associated with the deemed dividend were recorded as a deferred tax asset. However, it is expected that under the TCJA, the current and prior year foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be fully realizable.\nAs a result, the net deferred income tax expense impact of the deemed repatriation was $101 million and was recorded in \"Income Taxes\" on the PPL Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017 and \"Deferred tax liabilities\" on the PPL Balance Sheet at December 31, 2017.\nSee Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\nU.K. Membership in European Union (PPL)\nOn March 29, 2017, the U.K. formally notified the European Council of the European Union (EU) of its intent to withdraw from the EU, thereby commencing the two-year negotiation period to establish the terms of that withdrawal under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Article 50 specifies that if a member state decides to withdraw from the EU, it must notify the European\nCouncil of its intention to leave the EU, negotiate the terms of withdrawal and establish the legal grounds for its future relationship with the EU. Article 50 provides two years from the date of the Article 50 notification to conclude negotiations. Failure to complete negotiations within two years, unless negotiations are extended, would result in the treaties governing the EU no longer being applicable to the U.K. with there being no agreement in place governing the U.K.'s relationship with the EU. Under the terms of Article 50, negotiations can only be extended beyond two years if all of the 27 remaining EU states agree to an extension. Any withdrawal agreement will need to be approved by both the European Council and the European Parliament. There remains significant uncertainty as to the ultimate outcome of the withdrawal negotiations and the related impact on the U.K. economy and the GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rate.\nPPL has executed hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange risk to the Company's U.K. earnings. As of February 20, 2018, PPL's foreign exchange exposure related to budgeted earnings is 100% hedged for the remainder of 2018 at an average rate of $1.34 per GBP, 100% hedged for 2019 at an average rate of $1.39 per GBP and 35% hedged for 2020 at an average rate of $1.46 per GBP.\nPPL cannot predict either the short-term or long-term impact to foreign exchange rates or long-term impact on PPL's financial condition that may be experienced as a result of the actions taken by the U.K. government to withdraw from the EU, although such impacts could be significant.\nRegulatory Requirements\n(All Registrants)\nThe Registrants cannot predict the impact that future regulatory requirements may have on their financial condition or results of operations.\n(PPL)\nRIIO-2 Framework Review\nIn July 2017, Ofgem published an open letter commencing its RIIO-2 framework review, which covers all U.K. gas and electricity, transmission and distribution price controls. The purpose of this framework review is to build on lessons learned from the current price controls and to develop a framework that will be adaptable to meeting the needs of an evolving U.K. energy sector.\nThe letter sets out the context for the development of the next price controls, RIIO-2, and seeks views from stakeholders on the RIIO-2 framework. Responses to the open letter were published in September 2017 and will be used to guide the full RIIO-2 framework consultation which is expected to be published in March of 2018. The promulgation of sector specific price controls will begin with the gas and electricity transmission networks, with electricity distribution price control work scheduled to begin in 2020, at which time Ofgem plans to publish its RIIO-ED2 strategy consultation document.\nThe current electricity distribution price control, RIIO-ED1, continues through March 31, 2023 and will not be impacted by this RIIO-2 consultation process. PPL cannot predict the outcome of this process or the long-term impact it or the final RIIO-ED2 regulations will have on its financial condition or results of operations.\nRIIO-ED1 Mid-period Review\nIn December 2017, Ofgem initiated a consultation on a potential RIIO-ED1 mid-period review (MPR). The RIIO framework allows for a MPR of outputs halfway through the price control. Ofgem is consulting on three potential approaches:\n \u2022 whether to implement a MPR as currently defined; \n \u2022 whether to implement a MPR with an extension for WPD rail electrification; and \n \u2022 whether to implement a MPR with a significant extension of scope to include financial parameters. \nOfgem's initial assessment as set forth in its December 2017 consultation publication is that a MPR as currently defined under RIIO-ED1 is not required. In addition, Ofgem recognized that the rail electrification is outside the scope of the MPR and that implementing a MPR to include financial parameters could undermine the stability of the regulatory regime. The consultation, however, requests interested party comments on those conclusions. The period for submission of comments to the consultation closed on February 2, 2018. Formal consultation responses have been submitted by PPL and WPD. A decision on whether to\nproceed with a MPR is expected in spring 2018. If Ofgem decides to launch a MPR, it will consult on detailed proposals in summer 2018 and any associated changes to DNO licenses would be in place by April 1, 2019. Although, PPL cannot predict the outcome of the consultation process, a MPR is not expected to have a significant impact on PPL's financial condition or results of operations.\n(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nThe businesses of LKE, LG&E and KU are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to CCRs, GHG, ELGs and the Clean Power Plan. See Note 6, Note 13 and Note 19 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these significant environmental matters. These and other stringent environmental requirements led PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU to retire approximately 800 MW of coal-fired generating plants in Kentucky, primarily in 2015. Additionally, KU anticipates retiring two older coal-fired units at the E.W. Brown plant in 2019 with a combined summer rating capacity of 272 MW.\nAlso as a result of the environmental requirements discussed above, LKE projects $828 million ($335 million at LG&E and $493 million at KU) in environmental capital investment over the next five years. See PPL's \"Financial Condition - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures\", Note 6 and Note 13 for additional information.\nRate Case Proceedings\n(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nIn November 2016, LG&E and KU filed requests with the KPSC for increases in annual base electricity and gas rates. LG&E's and KU's applications included requests for CPCNs for implementing an Advanced Metering System program and a Distribution Automation program.\nIn April and May 2017, LG&E and KU, along with all intervening parties to the proceeding, filed with the KPSC, stipulation and recommendation agreements (stipulations) resolving all issues with the parties. Among other things, the proposed stipulations provided for increases in annual revenue requirements associated with LG&E base electricity rates of $59 million, LG&E base gas rates of $8 million and KU base electricity rates of $55 million, reflecting a return on equity of 9.75%, the withdrawal of LG&E's and KU's request for a CPCN for the Advanced Metering System and other changes to the revenue requirements, which dealt primarily with the timing of cost recovery, including depreciation rates.\nIn June 2017, the KPSC issued orders approving, with certain modifications, the proposed stipulations filed in April and May 2017. The orders modified the stipulations to provide for increases in annual revenue requirements associated with LG&E base electricity rates of $57 million, LG&E base gas rates of $7 million, KU base electricity rates of $52 million and incorporated an authorized return on equity of 9.7%. Consistent with the stipulations, the orders approved LG&E's and KU's request for implementing a Distribution Automation program and their withdrawal of a request for a CPCN for the Advanced Metering System program. The orders also approved new depreciation rates for LG&E and KU that resulted in higher depreciation of approximately $15 million ($4 million for LG&E and $11 million for KU) in 2017, exclusive of net additions to PP&E. The orders resulted in base electricity and gas rate increases of 5.2% and 2.1% at LG&E and a base electricity rate increase of 3.2% at KU. The new base rates and all elements of the orders became effective July 1, 2017. On June 23, 2017, the KPSC issued orders establishing an authorized return on equity of 9.7% for all of LG&E's and KU's existing approved ECR plans and projects, replacing the prior authorized return on equity levels of 9.8% for CCR projects and 10% for all other ECR approved projects, effective with bills issued in August 2017. The annual impact of the new authorized return for ECR projects is not expected to be significant.\n(LKE and KU)\nOn September 29, 2017, KU filed a request seeking approval from the VSCC to increase annual Virginia base electricity revenue by $7 million, representing an increase of 10.4%. KU's request is based on an authorized 10.42% return on equity. Subject to regulatory review and approval, new rates would become effective July 1, 2018.\n(PPL, LKE and KU)\nIn October 2016, KU filed a request with the FERC to modify its formula rates to provide for the recovery of CCR impoundment closure costs from its departing municipal customers. In December 2016, the FERC accepted the revised rate schedules providing recovery of the costs effective December 31, 2016, subject to refund, and established limited hearing and settlement judge procedures relating to determining the applicable amortization period. In March 2017, the parties reached a\nsettlement in principle regarding a suitable amortization period. In June 2017, a FERC judge issued an order implementing the settlement's rates on an interim basis, effective July 1, 2017. In August 2017, the FERC issued a final order approving the settlement.\nTCJA Impact on LG&E and KU Rates (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nOn December 21, 2017, Kentucky Industrial Utility Customers, Inc. submitted a complaint with the KPSC against LG&E and KU, as well as other utility companies in Kentucky, alleging that their respective rates would no longer be fair, just and reasonable following the enactment of the TCJA reducing the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The complaint requested the KPSC to issue an order requiring LG&E and KU to begin deferring, as of January 1, 2018, the revenue requirement effect of all income tax expense savings resulting from the federal corporate income tax reduction, including the amortization of excess deferred income taxes by recording those savings in a regulatory liability account and establishing a process by which the federal corporate income tax savings will be passed back to customers.\nOn December 27, 2017, as a result of the complaint, the KPSC ordered LG&E and KU to satisfy or address the complaint and commence recording regulatory liabilities to reflect the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate to 21% and the associated savings in excess deferred taxes on an interim basis until utility rates are adjusted to reflect the federal tax savings.\nOn January 8, 2018, LG&E and KU responded to the complaint, denying certain claims in the complaint but concurring that the TCJA will result in savings for their customers. LG&E and KU have stated in their responses that the companies have recorded regulatory liabilities as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate and the associated savings in excess deferred taxes and will make changes to their ECR, DSM and LG&E's GLT rate mechanisms to begin providing the applicable savings to customers. LG&E and KU also offered to establish a new bill credit mechanism effective with the April 2018 billing cycle to begin distributing the tax savings associated with base rates to customers.\nOn January 29, 2018, LG&E and KU reached a settlement agreement to commence returning savings related to the TCJA to their customers. The savings will be distributed through their ECR, DSM and LG&E's GLT rate mechanisms beginning in March 2018 and through a new bill credit mechanism from April 1, 2018 through April 30, 2019. The estimated impact of the rate reduction represents approximately $91 million in KU electricity revenues, $69 million in LG&E electricity revenues and $17 million in LG&E gas revenues for the period January 2018 through April 2019. Ongoing tax savings are expected to also be addressed in LG&E's and KU's next Kentucky base rate case. LG&E and KU have indicated their intent to file an application for base rate changes during 2018 to be effective during spring 2019. The settlement agreement is subject to review and approval by the KPSC. An order in the proceeding may occur during the first quarter of 2018.\nAdditionally, on January 8, 2018, the VSCC ordered KU, as well as other utilities in Virginia, to accrue regulatory liabilities reflecting the Virginia jurisdictional revenue requirement impacts of the reduced federal corporate tax rate.\nThe FERC has not issued any guidance on the effect on rates of the TCJA.\nLG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.\nTCJA Impact on PPL Electric Rates (PPL and PPL Electric)\nThe PUC issued a Secretarial Letter on February 12, 2018 regarding the TCJA. The Commission is requesting comments from interested parties addressing whether the Commission should adjust current customer rates to reflect the reduced federal income tax expense and, if so, the appropriate negative surcharge or other methodology that would permit immediate adjustment to consumer rates, and whether the surcharge or other said methodology should provide that any refunds to customers due to reduced taxes be effective as of January 1, 2018. In addition, the Secretarial Letter requests certain Pennsylvania regulated utilities, including PPL Electric, to provide certain data related to the effect of the TCJA on PPL Electric's income tax expense and rate base including whether any of the potential tax savings from the reduced federal corporate tax rate can be used for purposes other than to reduce customer rates. PPL Electric's responses are due to the PUC not later than March 9, 2018.\nThe FERC has not issued any guidance on the effect on rates of the TCJA.\nDiscontinued Operations (PPL)\nThe operations of PPL's Supply segment prior to its June 1, 2015 spinoff are included in \"Loss from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes)\" on the 2015 Statement of Income.\nSee Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information related to the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, including the components of Discontinued Operations.\nResults of Operations\n(PPL)\nThe \"Statement of Income Analysis\" discussion below describes significant changes in principal line items on PPL's Statements of Income, comparing year-to-year changes. The \"Segment Earnings\" and \"Margins\" discussions for PPL provide a review of results by reportable segment. These discussions include non-GAAP financial measures, including \"Earnings from Ongoing Operations\" and \"Margins,\" and provide explanations of the non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The \"2018 Outlook\" discussion identifies key factors expected to impact 2018 earnings.\nTables analyzing changes in amounts between periods within \"Statement of Income Analysis,\" \"Segment Earnings\" and \"Margins\" are presented on a constant GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rate basis, where applicable, in order to isolate the impact of the change in the exchange rate on the item being explained. Results computed on a constant GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rate basis are calculated by translating current year results at the prior year weighted-average GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rate.\n(PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nA \"Statement of Income Analysis, Earnings and Margins\" is presented separately for PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU.\nThe \"Statement of Income Analysis\" discussion below describes significant changes in principal line items on the Statements of Income, comparing year-to-year changes. The \"Earnings\" discussion provides a summary of earnings. The \"Margins\" discussion includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to \"Operating Income.\"\nPPL: Statement of Income Analysis, Segment Earnings and Margins\nStatement of Income Analysis\nNet income for the years ended December 31 includes the following results.\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(70\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(152\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel\n</td> <td>759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy purchases\n</td> <td>685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(149\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operation and maintenance\n</td> <td>1,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(110\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(193\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>1,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxes, other than income\n</td> <td>292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Operating Expenses\n</td> <td>4,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(90\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(369\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Income (Expense) - net\n</td> <td>(255\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(645\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>282\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Expense\n</td> <td>901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Taxes\n</td> <td>784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from"}
