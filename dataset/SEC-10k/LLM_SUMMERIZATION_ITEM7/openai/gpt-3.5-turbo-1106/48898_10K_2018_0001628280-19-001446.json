Products are either sourced complete, manufactured or assembled by subsidiaries in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Puerto Rico, China, Mexico, the UK, Brazil, Australia, Spain and Ireland. The Company also participates in joint ventures in Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Philippines, and maintains offices in Singapore, Italy, China, India, Mexico, South Korea, Chile, and countries in the Middle East. The Company employed approximately 19,700 individuals worldwide as of December 31, 2018.\nThe Company's reporting segments consist of the Electrical segment and the Power segment. Results for 2018, 2017 and 2016 by segment are included under Segment Results\u201d within this Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nThe Company's long-term strategy is to serve its customers with reliable and innovative electrical and related infrastructure solutions with desired brands, high-quality service, delivered through a competitive cost structure; to complement organic revenue growth with acquisitions that enhance its product offerings; and to allocate capital effectively to create shareholder value.\nOur strategy to complement organic revenue growth with acquisitions focuses on acquiring assets that extend our capabilities, expand our product offerings, and present opportunities to compete in core, adjacent or complementary markets. Our acquisition strategy also provides the opportunity to advance our revenue growth objectives during periods of weakness or inconsistency in our end-markets.\nOur strategy to deliver products through a competitive cost structure has resulted in past and ongoing restructuring and related activities. Our restructuring and related efforts include the consolidation of manufacturing and distribution facilities, and workforce actions, as well as streamlining and consolidating our back-office functions. The primary objectives of our restructuring and related activities are to optimize our manufacturing footprint, cost structure, and effectiveness and efficiency of our workforce.\nProductivity improvement also continues to be a key area of focus for the Company and efforts to drive productivity complement our restructuring and related activities to minimize the impact of rising material costs and administrative cost inflation. Material costs are approximately two-thirds of our cost of goods sold therefore volatility in this area can significantly impact profitability. Our goal is to have pricing and productivity programs that offset material and other inflationary cost increases as well as pay for investments in key growth areas.\nProductivity programs impact virtually all functional areas within the Company by reducing or eliminating waste and improving processes. We continue to expand our efforts surrounding global product and component sourcing and supplier cost reduction programs. Value engineering efforts, product transfers and the use of lean process improvement techniques are expected to continue to increase manufacturing efficiency. In addition, we continue to build upon the benefits of our enterprise resource planning system across all functions.\nAcquisition of Aclara\nOn February 2, 2018 the Company acquired Aclara for approximately $1.1 billion. Aclara is a leading global provider of smart infrastructure solutions for electric, gas, and water utilities, with advanced metering solutions and grid monitoring sensor technology, as well as leading software enabled installation services. The acquisition extends the Power segment's capabilities into smart automation technologies, accelerates ongoing innovation efforts to address utility customer demand for data and integrated solutions, and expands the segment's reach to a broader set of utility customers.\nFor additional information about the Aclara acquisition, refer to Note 3 - Business Acquisitions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K\n</td> <td>19\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operations are classified into two reportable segments: Electrical and Power. For a complete description of the Company's segments, see Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Within these segments, Hubbell serves customers in five primary end markets; non-residential construction, residential construction, industrial, energy-related markets (also referred to as oil and gas markets) and utility markets (also referred to as the electrical transmission and distribution (T&D) market). In order of magnitude of net sales, the Company's served markets are electrical T&D, non-residential construction, industrial, oil and gas, and residential construction.\nOur end markets experienced strong growth in 2018, driving organic net sales growth of 4.4%, including the traction we gained in the latter half of the year on price realization. We saw notable strength in 2018 in energy-related markets, including gas distribution, the core industrial market, and non-residential markets, as well as growth within the residential lighting market that accelerated in the second half of the year. Utility markets grew primarily within T&D and outside-the-plant telecommunications.\nNet sales growth from acquisitions was a highlight, as Aclara delivered strong revenue performance in 2018, demand for its products was strong and the Aclara acquisition has added a robust backlog and project pipeline.\nEarnings growth was also strong as our operating income grew by seven percent in 2018; however, inflationary pressures and material cost increases, including tariffs, pressured operating margins. During the second half of 2018, many of our businesses took pricing actions to mitigate the impact of material cost increases and the effect of Section 301 tariffs resulting from changes in U.S. trade policy in 2018 (the \"Tariffs\" referred to in the following discussion of results of operations). See Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" for additional discussion of developments stemming from the recent and potential changes in trade policies.\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, each grew by 29% in 2018 and reflect our strong operating income performance as well as the benefit of a lower effective tax rate resulting from the enactment of the TCJA.\nSUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ending December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Net sales\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Net sales\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Net sales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,481.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,668.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,505.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>3,181.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2,513.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2,400.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>1,300.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1,155.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1,105.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling & administrative expenses\n</td> <td>743.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>636.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>615.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>556.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>518.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>489.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Hubbell\n</td> <td>360.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>243.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>293.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EARNINGS PER SHARE - DILUTED\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the following discussion of results of operations, we refer to \"adjusted\" operating measures. We believe those adjusted measures, which exclude the impact of certain costs, may provide investors with useful information regarding our underlying performance from period to period and allow investors to understand our results of operations without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. Management uses these adjusted measures when assessing the performance of the business.\nOur adjusted operating measures exclude the income tax effects associated with U.S. tax reform recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017, Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs recognized in 2017 and 2018, and the loss on extinguishment of debt incurred in the third quarter of 2017, as further explained below, and as shown in the reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures that follow. However, the net tax benefit of approximately $6 million related to adjustments made in connection with the Company's accounting for the effects of TCJA during the measurement period in 2018 has not been reflected as an adjustment to the GAAP measures and is therefore not a reconciling item in the adjusted operating measures below.\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>20\n</td> <td>HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAclara acquisition-related and transaction costs\nAclara acquisition-related and transaction costs include the amortization of identified intangible assets and inventory step-up amortization expense. Aclara transaction costs are primarily for professional services and other fees incurred to complete the acquisition as well as certain financing costs recognized in interest expense in connection with the transaction. The effect of Aclara inventory step-up amortization expense and transaction costs are complete as of December 31, 2018. See Note 3 - Business Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information and further discussion of Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs. Only a portion of the Aclara transaction costs are expected to be tax deductible.\nLoss on the early extinguishment of debt\nOur consolidated results of operations in 2017 include a $10.1 million pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of long-term debt from the redemption of all of our $300 million outstanding long-term unsecured, unsubordinated notes that were scheduled to mature in 2018.\nThe following table provides the Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 by type and by location in the Consolidated Statement of Income (in millions):\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aclara acquisition-related costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aclara transaction costs\n</td> <td>12.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&A expense\n</td> <td>20.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HUBBELL INCORPORATED -

Acquisitions added 17.8% to net sales, primarily from the acquisition of Aclara, while organic volume, including favorable price realization, contributed 4.4%. The effect of foreign exchange was flat compared to the prior year.\nCost of Goods Sold\nAs a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold increased by 250 basis points to 71.0% of net sales in 2018 as compared to 68.5% in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by acquisitions, as 2018 includes $29.5 million of Aclara acquisition-related costs as well as the effect of adding the operating results of Aclara, which carries a relatively higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales (and lower gross margin) as compared to the legacy Hubbell business. The increase also reflects an unfavorable net impact of price and material costs, as rising material costs and the impact of Tariffs outpaced favorable price realization.\nGross Profit\nGross profit margin in 2018 compared to 2017 declined by 250 basis points to 29.0% of net sales, driven by costs of goods sold discussed above. Excluding Aclara acquisition-related costs, the adjusted gross profit margin was 29.7% in 2018 as compared to 31.5% in 2017.\nSelling & Administrative Expenses\nS&A expense in 2018 was $743.5 million and increased by $107.2 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the addition of S&A costs of Aclara, including $20.8 million of Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs. S&A expense as a percentage of net sales declined by 70 basis points to 16.6% in 2018. Excluding Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs, adjusted S&A expense as a percentage of net sales declined by 110 basis points to 16.1% in 2018 primarily due to volume leverage associated with higher net sales.\nOperating Income\nOperating income increased seven percent in 2018 to $556.9 million, primarily driven by the operating results of the Aclara business, including acquisition-related and transaction costs. The increase in operating income from higher net sales volume was largely offset by rising material costs and the impact of Tariffs, which together, outpaced favorable price realization.\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>22\n</td> <td>HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating margin decreased by 170 basis points to 12.4% due to higher Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs in 2018 as well as the operating results of the Aclara business, which carries a relatively lower gross margin as compared to the legacy Hubbell results. The decrease in operating margin also reflects the impact of material costs, tariffs and price realization noted above, which together were only partially offset by the benefit from higher net sales volume.\nExcluding Aclara Acquisition-related and transaction costs, adjusted operating income increased 15.5% percent in 2018 to $607.2 million and adjusted operating margin declined by 80 basis points to 13.5% in 2018.\nTotal Other Expense\nTotal other expense in 2018 was $89.9 million and increased by $14.2 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher interest expense from the issuance of $450 million of 2028 Notes and placement of the $500 million Term Loan, each in the first quarter of 2018, to finance the Aclara acquisition, partially offset by the loss on extinguishment of debt recognized in 2017 (which did not repeat in 2018).\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate was 21.6% in 2018 as compared to 43.6% in 2017. The decrease is primarily attributable to the absence of the $56.5 million provisional income tax expense associated with the TCJA recognized in the 2017 financial statements, the reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and net favorable adjustments to the 2017 provisional income tax expense associated with TCJA recognized in the current year.\nDuring 2018, the Company completed its analysis of the specific income tax effects of TCJA and recorded a net tax benefit of approximately $6 million related to adjustments to the prior provisional estimates and to record amounts related to items for which a prior provisional estimate had not been made. Additional information related to the Company's effective tax rate is included in Note 13 - Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNet Income Attributable to Hubbell and Earnings Per Diluted Share\nNet income attributable to Hubbell was $360.2 million in 2018 and increased 48% as compared to 2017. The increase reflects a lower effective tax rate, higher operating income and the loss on extinguishment of debt in 2017 (which did not repeat in 2018), offset partially by higher interest expense. Adjusted net income attributable to Hubbell was $401.7 million in 2018 and increased 29% as compared to 2017. Earnings per diluted share in 2018 increased 49% compared to 2017. Adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2018 increased 29% as compared to 2017.\nSegment Results\nElectrical Segment\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,660.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,532.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>320.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>294.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales in the Electrical segment were $2.7 billion, up five percent in 2018 as compared with 2017 due to approximately five percentage points of net sales growth from higher organic volume, including favorable price realization for the segment. Acquisitions increased net sales by less than one percentage point and the effect of foreign currency translation was flat.\nWithin the segment, the aggregate net sales of our Commercial and Industrial and Construction and Energy business groups increased by seven percentage points, due to approximately six percentage points of organic growth, and approximately one percentage point of net sales growth from acquisitions. Organic net sales growth of these businesses was driven primarily by our products serving the energy-related markets as well as the non-residential and residential construction markets. Net sales of our Lighting business group increased approximately two percent in 2018 due to higher organic volume, partially offset by pricing headwinds. Within the Lighting business group, net sales of residential lighting products increased by 12%, driven by strong unit volume growth, while net sales of commercial and industrial lighting products declined by 2% as a result of lower volume and pricing headwinds.\nOperating income in the Electrical segment for 2018 was $320.8 million and increased nine percent compared to 2017. Operating margin in 2018 increased by 50 basis points to 12.1%. The increase in operating margin is primarily due to incremental earnings on higher net sales, as discussed above, and productivity gains in excess of cost increases, partially offset by material cost headwinds (including the impact of Tariffs) that outpaced price realization.\nPower Segment\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,821.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,136.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>224.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs\n</td> <td>50.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>286.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>19.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating margin\n</td> <td>15.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K\n</td> <td>23\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales for 2018 in the Power segment were $1.8 billion, up approximately 60% as compared to 2017, primarily due to the addition of net sales of the Aclara business as well as higher organic volume. Acquisitions contributed 56.6% to net sales growth and higher organic volume contributed 4.1%, including favorable price realization. Organic net sales growth was driven by the transmission and distribution (T&D) and telecommunications markets. Foreign exchange reduced net sales as compared to the prior year by less than one percentage point.\nOperating income in the Power segment for 2018 increased by five percent to $236.1 million as compared to the prior year. Operating margin in 2018 decreased to 13.0% as compared to 19.8% in 2017 and reflects an approximately 2% decline from higher Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs in 2018, as well as approximately 2% attributable to the lower margin operating results of the Aclara business. The decrease in operating margin also reflects a net headwind from material cost increases (including the impact of Tariffs) that outpaced price realization, and the absence of a one-time benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nNet Sales\nNet sales of $3.7 billion in 2017 increased approximately five percent as compared to 2016. Acquisitions added two percentage points to net sales in 2017 and organic volume, including the impact of pricing headwinds, added three percentage points. Within our Electrical segment, organic net sales growth came primarily from products sold into the energy-related, non-residential and residential construction markets. Organic net sales within our Power segment increased by six percentage points primarily driven by growth in the electrical transmission and distribution market.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales in 2017 was 68.5% and was flat as compared to 2016. Price and material cost headwinds as well as a 30 basis point headwind from acquisitions, were offset by gains from productivity initiatives that exceeded cost inflation, greater realized savings from our restructuring and related actions and lower restructuring and related costs in 2017.\nThe headwind from acquisitions includes our investment in IoT capabilities in 2017 through the acquisition of iDevices.\nGross Profit\nThe gross profit margin for 2017 was 31.5% and was flat as compared to 2016, driven by costs of goods sold discussed above.\nSelling & Administrative Expenses\nS&A expense in 2017 was $636.3 million and increased by $21.0 million compared to the same period of the prior year. S&A expense as a percentage of net sales declined by 20 basis points to 17.3% in 2017. Excluding Aclara transaction costs, adjusted S&A expense as a percentage of net sales declined by 30 basis points to 17.2% in 2017 primarily due to higher net sales volume and greater realized savings from our restructuring and related actions, partially offset by acquisitions, which increased the adjusted S&A expense as a percentage of net sales by approximately 10 basis points.\nOperating Income\nOperating income increased six percent in 2017 to $518.8 million and operating margin increased by 10 basis points to 14.1%. Excluding Aclara transaction costs, adjusted operating income in 2017 was $525.5 million and the adjusted operating margin increased by 30 basis points to 14.3%. That increase was primarily due to greater realized savings from our restructuring and related actions and lower restructuring and related costs, productivity initiatives in excess of cost inflation as well as from incremental earnings on higher net sales volume. The benefit from those items was partially offset by price and material cost headwinds as well as a 40 basis point headwind from acquisitions, including our investment in IoT capabilities through the acquisition of iDevices.\nTotal Other Expense\nTotal other expense was $75.7 million in 2017 compared to $59.4 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $10.1 million pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of long-term debt recognized in 2017 and higher foreign exchange losses in 2017 partially offset by the write-off of an escrow receivable in 2016 associated with a prior acquisition. This escrow receivable write off had no effect on net income of the prior year as it was offset in income taxes by the release of a related liability.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate was 43.6% in 2017 and includes the provisional impact of the TCJA to the 2017 financial statements. Excluding the provisional impact of TCJA, the effective tax rate was 30.8% and was flat compared to the prior year. The favorable impact resulted primarily from the income tax effects of share based awards and settlement of a tax examination in 2017 offset by the impact of return to provision adjustments and other favorable discrete items realized in the prior year that did not repeat in the current year, including the release of a liability in 2016 caused by the expiration of certain statute of limitations associated with an uncertain tax position from a prior acquisition.\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>24\n</td> <td>HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Income attributable to Hubbell and Earnings Per Diluted Share\nNet income attributable to Hubbell was $243.1 million in 2017 and decreased 17% as compared to 2016. Adjusted net income attributable to Hubbell was $311.9 million in 2017 and increased 6% as compared to 2016. Earnings per diluted share in 2017 decreased 16% compared to 2016. Adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2017 increased 8% and reflects the increase in adjusted operating income in 2017 as well as a 0.6 million decline in the average number of diluted shares outstanding as compared to the prior year.\nSegment Results\nElectrical Segment\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,532.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,460.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>294.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>276.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales in the Electrical segment were $2.5 billion, up three percent in 2017 as compared with 2016 due to two percentage points of net sales growth from higher organic volume, including the impact of pricing headwinds, and one percentage point contributed by acquisitions.\nWithin the segment, the aggregate net sales of our Commercial and Industrial and Construction and Energy business groups increased by six percentage points, due to four percentage points of organic growth, and two percentage points of net sales growth from acquisitions. Organic net sales growth of these businesses was driven primarily by our products serving the energy-related markets as well as the non-residential and residential construction markets. Net sales of our Lighting business group decreased one percent in 2017 as two percentage points of headwind from pricing, was only partially offset by one percentage point of volume growth. Within the Lighting business group, net sales of residential lighting products increased by three percent, while net sales of commercial and industrial lighting products declined by two percentage points, primarily due to headwinds on pricing.\nOperating income in the Electrical segment for 2017 was $294.0 million and increased 6.4% compared to 2016. Operating margin in 2017 increased 40 basis points compared to 2016 as greater realized savings from our restructuring and related actions, lower restructuring and related costs, and the benefit from higher net sales volume, were partially offset by price and material cost headwinds and acquisitions. Acquisitions reduced the adjusted operating margin by approximately 50 basis points in 2017, and includes our investment in IoT capabilities through the acquisition of iDevices.\nPower Segment\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,136.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,045.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>224.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>213.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aclara transaction costs\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>213.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>19.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating margin\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales in the Power segment were $1.1 billion, up nine percent compared to 2016, primarily due to higher organic volume and net sales from acquisitions. The increase in organic volume contributed six percentage points driven by growth in the distribution and telecommunications markets, including storm-related sales associated with hurricanes in 2017, and acquisitions which contributed three percentage points to net sales growth.\nOperating income in the Power segment increased 5.3 percent to $224.8 million in 2017. Operating margin in 2017 decreased by 60 basis points to 19.8% primarily due to price and material cost headwinds, Aclara transaction costs, and higher restructuring and related costs. The impact of those items was partially offset by gains from productivity initiatives in excess of cost inflation as well as from incremental earnings on higher net sales volume. In 2016, operating margin included a benefit within cost inflation from the reduction of an environmental liability, and in 2017 operating margin includes a similarly-sized benefit within cost inflation from an insurance recovery.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K\n</td> <td>25\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flow\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>517.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>379.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>411.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(1,201.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(245.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(230.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>506.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(214.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(59.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(8.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>18.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(186.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(62.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparable periods have been recast to reflect the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement for share-based payments (ASU 2016-09).\nThe following table reconciles our cash flows from operating activities to free cash flows for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>517.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>379.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>411.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>(96.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(79.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(67.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>420.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>299.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>343.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow as a percent of net income attributable to Hubbell (1)\n</td> <td>116.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>123.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>117.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Free cash flow as a percent of net income attributable to Hubbell, includes the approximately $57 million impact of the TCJA in 2017. Free cash flow as a percentage of net income attributable to Hubbell excluding the impact of the TCJA is approximately 100% in 2017.\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful information regarding Hubbell's ability to generate cash without reliance on external financing. In addition, management uses free cash flow to evaluate the resources available for investments in the business, strategic acquisitions and further strengthening the balance sheet.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nCash provided by operating activities for 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily due to a higher contribution from net income and the related non-cash adjustments for depreciation and amortization, partially offset by $26.2 million of additional pension funding in 2018 compared to 2017. Cash used for working capital was $25.6 million in 2018 compared to $29.0 million in 2017 primarily due to improved inventory management in 2018, partially offset by higher accounts receivables and Aclara related items, including cash payments for transaction costs in 2018.\nCash used for investing activities of $1,201.4 million in 2018 increased compared to cash used of $245.6 million in 2017. This increase is primarily due to approximately $1.1 billion paid for the acquisition of Aclara in 2018, $16.5 million of higher capital expenditures and an $11.6 million decrease in the proceeds from disposition of assets in 2018, as compared to 2017.\nCash provided from financing activities of $506.5 million in 2018 increased compared to $214.3 million of cash used in 2017. The change in cash flows from financing activities reflects the proceeds of the $450 million public debt offering in February 2018 and $500 million Term Loan issued in February 2018 to fund the acquisition of Aclara, as well as, lower share repurchases in 2018, partially offset by cash used to reduce short-term borrowings.\nThe unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on cash was $8.2 million in 2018 as compared to a favorable impact of $18.3 million in 2017. The unfavorable impact in 2018 was primarily related to the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and British pound.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nCash provided by operating activities for 2017 decreased compared to 2016 primarily due to higher uses of cash for working capital. Cash used for working capital was $29.0 million in 2017 compared to $10.1 million in 2016 primarily due to higher inventories in anticipation of increased demand, partially offset by stronger collections of accounts receivable and higher income taxes payable, due to the impact of the TCJA in 2017.\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>26\n</td> <td>HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash used for investing activities of $245.6 million in 2017 increased compared to cash used of $230.2 million in 2016. This increase is primarily due to $12.5 million of higher capital expenditures and $10.7 million of higher cash paid for acquisitions, partially offset by a $7.6 million increase in the proceeds from disposition of assets in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nCash used for financing activities of $214.3 million in 2017 increased compared to $59.4 million of cash used in 2016. The increase in cash used in 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily the result of higher net proceeds from long-term borrowings in 2016 and an increase in shareholder dividends paid in 2017, partially offset by a decrease in shares repurchased in 2017, as well as an increase in short term borrowings in 2017.\nThe favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on cash increased to $18.3 million in 2017 as compared to an unfavorable impact of $27.3 million in 2016. The favorable impact in 2017 was primarily related to the U.S. dollar weakening against the British pound, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar.\nInvestments in Our Business\nInvestments in our business include cash outlays for the acquisition of businesses as well as expenditures to maintain the operation of our equipment and facilities and invest in restructuring activities.\nIn February 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Aclara for approximately $1.1 billion in an all-cash transaction. To fund the Aclara acquisition, on February 2, 2018 the Company borrowed $500 million under a Term Loan Agreement with a syndicate of lenders, issued $450 million of unsecured, 3.50% senior notes maturing in 2028, and the remaining purchase price and transaction expenses were funded with commercial paper. Refer to Note 3 - Business Acquisitions and Note 12 - Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nWe continually invest in restructuring and related programs to maintain a competitive cost structure, drive operational efficiency and mitigate the impact of rising material costs and administrative cost inflation. As a result of these programs we have exited a total of 29 manufacturing and warehousing facilities since those programs began in late 2014. We expect our investment in restructuring and related spend in 2019 and 2020 to increase as we initiate further footprint consolidation and cost reduction initiatives.\nIn connection with our restructuring and related programs we incur restructuring costs as defined by U.S. GAAP, which are primarily severance and employee benefits, asset impairments, as well as facility closure, contract termination and certain pension costs that are directly related to restructuring actions. We also incur restructuring-related costs, which are costs associated with our business transformation initiatives, including the consolidation of back-office functions and streamlining our processes, and certain other costs and gains associated with restructuring actions. We refer to these costs on combined basis as \"restructuring and related costs\", which is a non-GAAP measure.\nRestructuring costs are predominantly settled in cash from our operating activities and are generally settled within one year, with the exception of asset impairments, which are non-cash. Restructuring costs in 2016 also included a $12.5 million charge to recognize the estimated liability associated with the withdrawal from a multi-employer pension plan, which may be settled either in periodic payments over approximately 19 years, or in a lump sum, subject to negotiation.\nThe table below presents the restructuring and related costs incurred in 2018, additional expected costs, and the expected completion date for those restructuring actions that were initiated in 2018 and prior years (in millions):\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Costs Incurred in 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Additional Expected Costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expected Completion Date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Restructuring Actions\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 and Prior Restructuring Actions(a)\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring cost (GAAP measure)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring-related costs\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and related costs (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Additional expected cost does not include any potential future liability, in excess of amounts already recognized in 2016, associated with the withdrawal from the multi-employer pension plan referred to in the preceding paragraph. Additional information about the estimated withdrawal liability associated with that multi-employer plan is included in Note 11 - Retirement Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring 2018, we used cash of $96.2 million for capital expenditures, an increase of $16.5 million from 2017 as we made higher investments in facilities and equipment during 2018 to support our continuing focus on productivity, and due to the acquisition of Aclara.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn October 20, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the October 2017 program\u201d) that authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of Common Stock and expires on October 20, 2020. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has repurchased $40.0 million of shares of Common Stock, bringing the remaining share repurchase authorization to $360.0 million. Subject to numerous factors, including market conditions and alternative uses of cash, we may conduct discretionary repurchases through open market or privately negotiated transactions, which may include repurchases under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nDebt to Capital\nAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had $1,737.1 million and $987.1 million, respectively, of long-term unsecured, unsubordinated notes, net of unamortized discount and the unamortized balance of capitalized debt issuance costs. At December 31, 2018 the Company also had $25.0 million of long-term debt classified as short-term on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, reflecting maturities due within the next 12 months.\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K\n</td> <td>27\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2017 long-term debt consisted of unsecured, senior notes in principal amounts of $300 million due in 2022 (the \"2022 Notes\"), $400 million due in 2026 (the \"2026 Notes\"), and $300 million due in 2027 (the \"2027 Notes\").\nIn February 2018, the Company completed a public debt offering of $450 million principal amount of unsecured, senior notes maturing in February 2028 and bearing interest at a fixed rate of 3.50% (the \"2028 Notes\"). Net proceeds from the issuance were $442.6 million after deducting the discount on the notes and offering expenses paid by the Company.\nThe 2022 Notes, 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes and 2028 Notes are callable at any time at specified prices and are only subject to accelerated payment prior to maturity upon customary events of default under the indentures governing such Notes, or upon a change in control triggering event as defined in such indentures. The Company was in compliance with all covenants (none of which are financial) as of December 31, 2018.\nOn January 31, 2018, the Company entered into a Term Loan Agreement (the Term Loan Agreement\u201d) with a syndicate of lenders under which the Company borrowed $500 million on an unsecured basis to partially finance the Aclara acquisition on February 2, 2018. The interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement is generally either adjusted LIBOR plus an applicable margin (determined by a ratings based grid) or the alternate base rate. The sole financial covenant in the Term Loan Agreement requires that total debt not exceed 65% of total capitalization as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Company.\nThe principal amount of borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement amortize in equal quarterly installments of 5% per year in year one, 5% per year in year two, 7.5% per year in year three, 10% per year in year four, 10% per year in year five, and any remaining borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement are due and payable in full in February 2023. The Company may also make principal payments in excess of the amortization schedule at its discretion and, during 2018, the Company made $150 million of such payments.\nPursuant to the contractual loan amortization schedule, $25.0 million of borrowings under the Term Loan are classified as short-term within current liabilities on the December 31, 2018 Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn August 2017, the Company completed a public debt offering of $300 million of long-term, unsecured, senior notes maturing in August 2027 and bearing interest at a fixed rate of 3.15% (the \"2027 Notes\"). Net proceeds from the issuance were $294.6 million after deducting the discount on the notes and offering expenses paid by the Company. In September 2017, the Company applied the net proceeds from the 2027 Notes to redeem all of its $300 million of long-term, unsecured, unsubordinated notes maturing in 2018 and bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.95%. In connection with this redemption, the Company recognized a loss on the early extinguishment of the 2018 Notes of $6.3 million on an after-tax basis.\nAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had $56.1 million and $68.1 million, respectively, of short-term debt outstanding composed of;\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>$26.0 million and $63.0 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>$25 million of long-term debt classified as short-term within current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, reflecting maturities within the next 12 months relating to borrowing under the Term Loan at December 31, 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>$5.1 million of borrowings to support our international operations in China at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet debt, defined as total debt less cash and investments, is a non-GAAP measure that may not be comparable to definitions used by other companies.

These activities were funded primarily with additional debt financing and cash flows from operations as further described below.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>Cash used for the acquisition of businesses in 2018, net of cash acquired was $1,118.0 million, including cash settlement of a deferred purchase price obligation and a net working capital adjustment related to acquisitions completed in prior years.

Commitments under the 2018 Credit Facility may be increased (subject to certain conditions) to an aggregate amount not to exceed $1.250 billion. The interest rate applicable to borrowings under the 2018 Credit Facility is generally either the adjusted LIBOR plus an applicable margin (determined by a ratings based grid) or the alternate base rate. The single financial covenant in the 2018 Credit Facility requires that total debt not exceed 65% of total capitalization as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Company.

The annual commitment fees associated with these lines of credit are not material.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPension Funding Status\nWe have a number of funded and unfunded non-contributory U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension plans. Benefits under these plans are generally provided based on either years of service and final average pay or a specified dollar amount per year of service. The funded status of our qualified, defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including future returns on invested pension assets, the level of market interest rates, employee earnings and employee demographics.\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K\n</td> <td>29\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2018, the Company approved amendments to one of its foreign defined benefit pension plans, which closed the plan to future service accruals effective August 31, 2018. As a result of the amendments, in the third quarter of 2018, the Company recognized a curtailment gain of approximately $4.7 million, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income. In addition, effective August 31, 2018, the amortization of actuarial gains and losses is being recognized over the remaining life expectancy of the participants of this plan, as all participants are considered inactive as a result of the amendment.\nIn December 2016, the Company approved amendments to the domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan and non-qualified defined benefit plan, which froze service accruals for active participants effective February 28, 2017 and further will freeze compensation accruals effective December 31, 2020. The Company also froze all accruals in a second non-qualified defined benefit plan effective December 31, 2016. As a result of the amendments, the Company recognized a $34.1 million curtailment gain in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2016 and recognized $0.2 million of pension expense in 2016. In addition, effective January 1, 2017, the amortization of unrecognized gains and losses of these plans is recognized over the remaining life expectancy of participants, as all participants are considered inactive as a result of the amendments.\nIn 2018 and 2016, we completed transactions with third-party insurers to settle approximately $28 million and $40 million, respectively of projected benefit obligations of our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plans.\nChanges in the value of the defined benefit plan assets and liabilities will affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. Although differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results are no longer deferred for balance sheet purposes, deferral is still permitted for pension expense purposes. Unrecognized gains and losses in excess of an annual calculated minimum amount (the greater of 10% of the projected benefit obligation or 10% of the market value of assets) have been amortized and recognized in net periodic pension cost. Effective January 1, 2017, the amortization of unrecognized gains and losses of our primary domestic defined benefit plan is being recognized over the remaining life expectancy of participants, which is approximately 20 years. During 2018 and 2017, we recorded $10.5 million and $11.4 million, respectively, of pension expense related to the amortization of these unrecognized losses.\nIn 2018, 2017 and 2016, we contributed $27.9 million, $1.7 million, and $18.0 million, respectively, to our qualified foreign and domestic defined benefit pension plans. These contributions have improved the funded status of those plans. Although not required by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, the Company may elect to make a voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic defined benefit pension plan in 2019. The Company expects to contribute approximately $0.5 million to its foreign plans in 2019. The anticipated level of pension funding in 2019 is not expected to have a significant impact on our overall liquidity.\nAssumptions\nThe following assumptions were used to determine projected pension and other benefit obligations at the measurement date and the net periodic benefit costs for the year:\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pension Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other Benefits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>4.24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>3.67\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>3.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase\n</td> <td>3.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>3.24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.05\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>3.67\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>4.12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>4.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>4.68\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>4.94\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase\n</td> <td>3.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>3.55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>3.93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt the end of each year, we estimate the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets based on the strategic asset allocation for our plans. In making this determination, we utilize expected rates of return for each asset class based upon current market conditions and expected risk premiums for each asset class. A one percentage point change in the expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets would have an impact of approximately $6.7 million on 2019 pretax pension expense. The expected long-term rate of return is applied to the fair market value of pension fund assets to produce the expected return on fund assets that is included in pension expense.\nThe difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets was recognized at December 31, 2018 for balance sheet purposes, but continues to be deferred for expense purposes. The net deferral of past asset gains (losses) ultimately affects future pension expense through the amortization of gains (losses) with an offsetting adjustment to Hubbell shareholders' equity through Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>30\n</td> <td>HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of our pension plan liabilities. For our U.S. and Canadian pension plans, this discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows associated with our benefit obligations to the expected cash flows of a hypothetical portfolio of high quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that closely match the expected funding period of our pension liabilities. As of December 31, 2018, we used a discount rate of 4.40% for our U.S. pension plans compared to a discount rate of 3.80% used in 2017. For our Canadian pension plan, we used a discount rate of 3.60% in 2018, compared to the 3.50% discount rate used in 2017.\nFor our UK pension plan the discount rate was derived using a yield curve fitted to the yields on AA bonds in the Barclays Capital Sterling Aggregate Corporate Index and uses sample plan cash flow data as a proxy to plan specific liability cash flows. The derived discount rate is the single discount rate equivalent to discounting these liability cash flows at the term-dependent spot rates of AA corporate bonds. This methodology resulted in a December 31, 2018 discount rate for the UK pension plan of 2.90% as compared to a discount rate of 2.60% used in 2017.\nAn increase of one percentage point in the discount rate would lower our 2019 pretax pension expense by approximately $1.4 million. A discount rate decline of one percentage point would increase our 2019 pretax pension expense by approximately $1.6 million.\nIn 2018 we changed the mortality table used to calculate the present value of our pension plan liabilities from the RP-2014 mortality table, with generational projection from 2006 using Scale MP-2017 to the RP-2014 mortality table, with generational projection from 2006 using Scale MP-2018. That change did not have a material impact to the projected benefit obligation of our U.S. plans upon remeasurement at December 31, 2018. The RP-2014 mortality table with generational projection from 2006 using Scale MP-2018 was chosen as the best estimate based on the observed and anticipated experience of the plans after considering alternative tables.\nOther Post Employment Benefits ( OPEB\u201d)\nThe Company also has a number of health care and life insurance benefit plans covering eligible employees who reached retirement age while working for the Company. These benefits have been discontinued for substantially all future retirees. These plans are not funded and, therefore, no assumed rate of return on assets is required. We use a similar methodology to derive the yield curve for our post employment benefit plan obligations that we use for our pension plans. As of December 31, 2018, the Company used a discount rate of 4.40% to determine the projected benefit obligation compared to a discount rate of 3.70% used in 2017.\nIn accordance with the accounting guidance for retirement benefits, we recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive loss, within Hubbell shareholders' equity, a charge, net of tax, of approximately $0.3 million in 2018 and a charge, net of tax, of approximately $1.6 million in 2017, related to the annual remeasurement of the OPEB plans and the amortization of prior service credits and net actuarial gains.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements are defined as any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity that is not included in our consolidated results is a party, under which we, whether or not a party to the arrangement, have, or in the future may have: (1) an obligation under a direct or indirect guarantee or similar arrangement, (2) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity for such assets, (3) an obligation or liability, including a contingent obligation or liability, under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument, except that it is excluded from the scope of FASB ASC Topic 815, or (4) an obligation, including a contingent obligation, arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that is held by, and material to, the Company, where such entity provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with, the Company.\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined above which have or are likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources or cash flows.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K\n</td> <td>31\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of our contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2018 is as follows (in millions):\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>2022-2023\n</td> <td>2024 and\nthereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,756.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>525.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,150.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt obligations(a)\n</td> <td>56.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected interest payments\n</td> <td>401.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>111.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retirement and other benefits(b) (c)\n</td> <td>204.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>347.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>322.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obligations under customer incentive programs\n</td> <td>52.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax payments(d)\n</td> <td>28.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TOTAL\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,958.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>527.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>278.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>668.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,484.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Amounts exclude unamortized discount and capitalized debt issuance costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>Amounts above reflect projected funding related to the Company's non-qualified defined benefit and OPEB plans.

We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors deemed relevant by management. We continually review these estimates and their underlying assumptions to ensure they are appropriate for the circumstances. Changes in estimates and assumptions used by us could have a material impact on our financial results. We believe that the following estimates are among the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These items utilize assumptions and estimates about the effect of future events that are inherently uncertain and are based on our judgment.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations identified under the terms of contracts with its customers are satisfied, which generally occurs, for products, upon the transfer of control in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions of the sale. The majority of the Company's revenue associated with products is recognized at a point in time when the product is shipped to the customer, with a relatively small amount of transactions in the Power segment recognized upon delivery of the product at the contractually specified destination. Revenue from service contracts and post-shipment performance obligations is less than three percent of total annual consolidated net revenue and those service contracts and post-shipment obligations are primarily within the Power segment. Revenue from service contracts and post-shipment performance obligations is recognized when or as those obligations are satisfied. The Company primarily offers assurance-type standard warranties that do not represent separate performance obligations and on occasion will separately offer and price extended warranties that are separate performance obligations for which the associated revenue is recognized over-time based on the extended warranty period. The Company records amounts billed to customers for reimbursement of shipping and handling costs within revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of goods sold. Sales taxes and other usage-based taxes are excluded from revenue.\nThe Company has certain arrangements that require us to estimate at the time of sale the amounts of variable consideration that should not be recorded as revenue as certain amounts are not expected to be collected from customers, as well as an estimate of the value of the product to be returned. The Company principally relies on historical experience, specific customer agreements and anticipated future trends to estimate these amounts at the time of shipment and to reduce the transaction price. These arrangements include sales discounts and allowances based on sales volumes, specific programs and special pricing allowances, and returned goods, as are customary in the electrical products industry. Customer returns have historically ranged from 1%-2% of gross sales.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories in the U.S. are primarily valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market, while non-U.S. inventories are valued at the lower of FIFO cost or market. We routinely evaluate the carrying value of our inventories to ensure they are carried at the lower of LIFO or FIFO cost or market value. Such evaluation is based on our judgment and use of estimates, including sales forecasts, gross margins for particular product groupings, planned dispositions of product lines, technological events and overall industry trends. In addition, the evaluation is based on changes in inventory management practices which may influence the timing of exiting products and method of disposing of excess inventory.\nExcess inventory is generally identified by comparing future expected inventory usage to actual on-hand quantities. Inventory values are reduced for on-hand inventory in excess of pre-defined usage forecasts. Forecast usage is primarily determined by projecting historical (actual) sales and inventory usage levels forward to future periods. Changes in these estimates may necessitate future adjustments to inventory values.\nCustomer Credit and Collections\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable in order to reflect the potential uncollectability of receivables related to purchases of products on open credit. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make required payments, we may be required to record additional allowances for doubtful accounts.\nAccrued Insurance\nWe retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers' compensation, medical, automobile and general liability insurance. We estimate self-insurance liabilities using a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The accrued liabilities associated with these programs are based on our estimates of ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. These assumptions are periodically reviewed with a third-party actuary to determine the adequacy of these self-insurance reserves. Changes in these assumptions may necessitate future adjustments to these self-insurance liabilities.\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K\n</td> <td>33\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEmployee Benefits Costs and Funding\nWe sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension, defined contribution and other postretirement plans. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on the pension fund assets, rate of increase in employee compensation levels and health care cost increase projections. These assumptions are determined based on Company data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement dates. Further discussion of the assumptions used in 2018 and 2017 are included above under Pension Funding Status\u201d and in Note 11 - Retirement Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTaxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. Additionally, deferred tax assets are required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets are the forecast of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets, and future reversals of deferred tax liabilities. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income can affect the ultimate realization of net deferred tax assets.\nWe operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) and other tax authorities routinely review our tax returns. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. The Company records uncertain tax positions when it has determined that it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The Company uses the criteria established in the accounting guidance to determine whether an item meets the definition of more-likely-than-not. The Company's policy is to recognize these uncertain tax positions when the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, when the statute of limitations has expired or upon settlement. In management's opinion, adequate provision has been made for potential adjustments arising from any examinations. See Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies and Note 13 - Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContingent Liabilities\nWe are subject to proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims or uncertainties related to environmental, legal, product and other matters. We routinely assess the likelihood of an adverse judgment or outcome to these matters, as well as the range of potential losses. We record a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. A determination of the reserves required, if any, is made after careful analysis, including consultations with outside advisors, where applicable. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments.\nWarranty\nThe Company offers product warranties that cover defects on most of its products. These warranties primarily apply to products that are properly installed, maintained and used for their intended purpose. The Company accrues estimated warranty costs at the time of sale. Estimated warranty expenses, recorded in cost of goods sold, are based upon historical information such as past experience, product failure rates, or the estimated number of units to be repaired or replaced. Adjustments are made to the product warranty accrual as claims are incurred, additional information becomes known or as historical experience indicates.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets include land, buildings, equipment, molds and dies, software, goodwill and other intangible assets. Long-lived assets, other than land, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill represents purchase price in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets primarily consist of patents, tradenames and customer related intangibles.\nWe review depreciable long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. If such a change in circumstances occurs, the related estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition is compared to the carrying amount. If the sum of the expected cash flows of the asset group is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recorded. The impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. The fair value of impaired assets is determined using expected cash flow estimates, quoted market prices when available and appraisals as appropriate. We did not record any material impairment charges related to long-lived assets in 2018, 2017, or 2016.\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>34\n</td> <td>HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment unless circumstances dictate the need for more frequent assessment. We perform our goodwill impairment testing as of April 1st of each year unless circumstances dictate the need for more frequent assessments. The accounting guidance provides entities an option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing a quantitative analysis. If the entity determines, on the basis of certain qualitative factors, that it is more-likely-than-not that the goodwill is not impaired, the entity would not need to proceed to the two step goodwill impairment testing process as prescribed in the guidance. The Company performed a qualitative assessment for six of its seven reporting units. The Company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative analysis for its remaining reporting unit. The goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future discounted cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. We use internal discounted cash flow estimates to determine fair value. These cash flow estimates are derived from historical experience and future long-term business plans and the application of an appropriate discount rate. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. As of April 1, 2018, our goodwill testing resulted in fair values for each reporting unit that substantially exceeded the reporting unit's carrying value. We have not recorded any goodwill impairments since the initial adoption of the accounting guidance in 2002.\nThe identification and measurement of impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If it is more-likely-than-not that the asset is impaired, the fair value of the indefinite lived intangibles will be determined using discounted cash flow estimates. If the carrying value of these assets exceeds the estimated fair value, the carrying value will be reduced to the estimated fair value. We did not record any impairments related to indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2018, 2017, or 2016.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe determine the grant date fair value of certain stock-based compensation awards using either a lattice model or the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Both of these models require management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. These inputs include assumptions for the expected term, stock volatility, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate. Changes in these inputs impact fair value and could impact our stock-based compensation expense in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those awards expected to meet the service and performance vesting conditions. If our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, adjustments to stock-based compensation expense may be required. See also Note 17 - Stock-Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nForward-Looking Statements\nSome of the information included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, contain forward-looking statements\u201d as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include statements about our expected capital resources, liquidity, financial performance, pension funding, and results of operations and are based on our reasonable current expectations. In addition, all statements regarding the expected financial impact of the integration of Aclara, adoption of updated accounting standards and any expected effects of such adoption, restructuring plans and expected associated costs and benefits, intent to repurchase shares of Common Stock, and change in operating results, anticipated market conditions and productivity initiatives are forward looking.

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nExecutive Overview of the Business\n \nThe Company is primarily engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of quality electrical and electronic products for a broad range of non-residential and residential construction, industrial and utility applications. Products are either sourced complete, manufactured or assembled by subsidiaries in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Puerto Rico, China, Mexico, the UK, Brazil, Australia, Spain and Ireland. The Company also participates in joint ventures in Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Philippines, and maintains offices in Singapore, Italy, China, India, Mexico, South Korea, Chile, and countries in the Middle East. The Company employed approximately 19,700 individuals worldwide as of December 31, 2018.\nThe Company's reporting segments consist of the Electrical segment and the Power segment. Results for 2018, 2017 and 2016 by segment are included under Segment Results\u201d within this Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nThe Company's long-term strategy is to serve its customers with reliable and innovative electrical and related infrastructure solutions with desired brands, high-quality service, delivered through a competitive cost structure; to complement organic revenue growth with acquisitions that enhance its product offerings; and to allocate capital effectively to create shareholder value.\nOur strategy to complement organic revenue growth with acquisitions focuses on acquiring assets that extend our capabilities, expand our product offerings, and present opportunities to compete in core, adjacent or complementary markets. Our acquisition strategy also provides the opportunity to advance our revenue growth objectives during periods of weakness or inconsistency in our end-markets.\nOur strategy to deliver products through a competitive cost structure has resulted in past and ongoing restructuring and related activities. Our restructuring and related efforts include the consolidation of manufacturing and distribution facilities, and workforce actions, as well as streamlining and consolidating our back-office functions. The primary objectives of our restructuring and related activities are to optimize our manufacturing footprint, cost structure, and effectiveness and efficiency of our workforce.\nProductivity improvement also continues to be a key area of focus for the Company and efforts to drive productivity complement our restructuring and related activities to minimize the impact of rising material costs and administrative cost inflation. Material costs are approximately two-thirds of our cost of goods sold therefore volatility in this area can significantly impact profitability. Our goal is to have pricing and productivity programs that offset material and other inflationary cost increases as well as pay for investments in key growth areas.\nProductivity programs impact virtually all functional areas within the Company by reducing or eliminating waste and improving processes. We continue to expand our efforts surrounding global product and component sourcing and supplier cost reduction programs. Value engineering efforts, product transfers and the use of lean process improvement techniques are expected to continue to increase manufacturing efficiency. In addition, we continue to build upon the benefits of our enterprise resource planning system across all functions.\nAcquisition of Aclara\nOn February 2, 2018 the Company acquired Aclara for approximately $1.1 billion. Aclara is a leading global provider of smart infrastructure solutions for electric, gas, and water utilities, with advanced metering solutions and grid monitoring sensor technology, as well as leading software enabled installation services. The acquisition extends the Power segment's capabilities into smart automation technologies, accelerates ongoing innovation efforts to address utility customer demand for data and integrated solutions, and expands the segment's reach to a broader set of utility customers.\nFor additional information about the Aclara acquisition, refer to Note 3 - Business Acquisitions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K 19 \nResults of Operations\n \nOur operations are classified into two reportable segments: Electrical and Power. For a complete description of the Company's segments, see Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Within these segments, Hubbell serves customers in five primary end markets; non-residential construction, residential construction, industrial, energy-related markets (also referred to as oil and gas markets) and utility markets (also referred to as the electrical transmission and distribution (T&D) market). In order of magnitude of net sales, the Company's served markets are electrical T&D, non-residential construction, industrial, oil and gas, and residential construction.\nOur end markets experienced strong growth in 2018, driving organic net sales growth of 4.4%, including the traction we gained in the latter half of the year on price realization. We saw notable strength in 2018 in energy-related markets, including gas distribution, the core industrial market, and non-residential markets, as well as growth within the residential lighting market that accelerated in the second half of the year. Utility markets grew primarily within T&D and outside-the-plant telecommunications.\nNet sales growth from acquisitions was a highlight, as Aclara delivered strong revenue performance in 2018, demand for its products was strong and the Aclara acquisition has added a robust backlog and project pipeline.\nEarnings growth was also strong as our operating income grew by seven percent in 2018; however, inflationary pressures and material cost increases, including tariffs, pressured operating margins. During the second half of 2018, many of our businesses took pricing actions to mitigate the impact of material cost increases and the effect of Section 301 tariffs resulting from changes in U.S. trade policy in 2018 (the \"Tariffs\" referred to in the following discussion of results of operations). See Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" for additional discussion of developments stemming from the recent and potential changes in trade policies.\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, each grew by 29% in 2018 and reflect our strong operating income performance as well as the benefit of a lower effective tax rate resulting from the enactment of the TCJA.\nSUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\n\nIn the following discussion of results of operations, we refer to \"adjusted\" operating measures. We believe those adjusted measures, which exclude the impact of certain costs, may provide investors with useful information regarding our underlying performance from period to period and allow investors to understand our results of operations without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. Management uses these adjusted measures when assessing the performance of the business.\nOur adjusted operating measures exclude the income tax effects associated with U.S. tax reform recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017, Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs recognized in 2017 and 2018, and the loss on extinguishment of debt incurred in the third quarter of 2017, as further explained below, and as shown in the reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures that follow. However, the net tax benefit of approximately $6 million related to adjustments made in connection with the Company's accounting for the effects of TCJA during the measurement period in 2018 has not been reflected as an adjustment to the GAAP measures and is therefore not a reconciling item in the adjusted operating measures below.\n 20 HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K \nAclara acquisition-related and transaction costs\nAclara acquisition-related and transaction costs include the amortization of identified intangible assets and inventory step-up amortization expense. Aclara transaction costs are primarily for professional services and other fees incurred to complete the acquisition as well as certain financing costs recognized in interest expense in connection with the transaction. The effect of Aclara inventory step-up amortization expense and transaction costs are complete as of December 31, 2018. See Note 3 - Business Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information and further discussion of Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs. Only a portion of the Aclara transaction costs are expected to be tax deductible.\nLoss on the early extinguishment of debt\nOur consolidated results of operations in 2017 include a $10.1 million pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of long-term debt from the redemption of all of our $300 million outstanding long-term unsecured, unsubordinated notes that were scheduled to mature in 2018.\nThe following table provides the Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 by type and by location in the Consolidated Statement of Income (in millions):\n\n HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K 21 \nThe following table reconciles our adjusted financial measures to the directly comparable GAAP financial measure (in millions, except per share amounts):\n\n2018 Compared to 2017\nNet Sales\nNet sales of $4.5 billion in 2018 increased 22.2% percent compared to 2017 due to the contribution of net sales from acquisitions, higher organic volume and favorable price realization. Acquisitions added 17.8% to net sales, primarily from the acquisition of Aclara, while organic volume, including favorable price realization, contributed 4.4%. The effect of foreign exchange was flat compared to the prior year.\nCost of Goods Sold\nAs a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold increased by 250 basis points to 71.0% of net sales in 2018 as compared to 68.5% in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by acquisitions, as 2018 includes $29.5 million of Aclara acquisition-related costs as well as the effect of adding the operating results of Aclara, which carries a relatively higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales (and lower gross margin) as compared to the legacy Hubbell business. The increase also reflects an unfavorable net impact of price and material costs, as rising material costs and the impact of Tariffs outpaced favorable price realization.\nGross Profit\nGross profit margin in 2018 compared to 2017 declined by 250 basis points to 29.0% of net sales, driven by costs of goods sold discussed above. Excluding Aclara acquisition-related costs, the adjusted gross profit margin was 29.7% in 2018 as compared to 31.5% in 2017.\nSelling & Administrative Expenses\nS&A expense in 2018 was $743.5 million and increased by $107.2 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the addition of S&A costs of Aclara, including $20.8 million of Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs. S&A expense as a percentage of net sales declined by 70 basis points to 16.6% in 2018. Excluding Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs, adjusted S&A expense as a percentage of net sales declined by 110 basis points to 16.1% in 2018 primarily due to volume leverage associated with higher net sales.\nOperating Income\nOperating income increased seven percent in 2018 to $556.9 million, primarily driven by the operating results of the Aclara business, including acquisition-related and transaction costs. The increase in operating income from higher net sales volume was largely offset by rising material costs and the impact of Tariffs, which together, outpaced favorable price realization.\n 22 HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K \nOperating margin decreased by 170 basis points to 12.4% due to higher Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs in 2018 as well as the operating results of the Aclara business, which carries a relatively lower gross margin as compared to the legacy Hubbell results. The decrease in operating margin also reflects the impact of material costs, tariffs and price realization noted above, which together were only partially offset by the benefit from higher net sales volume.\nExcluding Aclara Acquisition-related and transaction costs, adjusted operating income increased 15.5% percent in 2018 to $607.2 million and adjusted operating margin declined by 80 basis points to 13.5% in 2018.\nTotal Other Expense\nTotal other expense in 2018 was $89.9 million and increased by $14.2 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher interest expense from the issuance of $450 million of 2028 Notes and placement of the $500 million Term Loan, each in the first quarter of 2018, to finance the Aclara acquisition, partially offset by the loss on extinguishment of debt recognized in 2017 (which did not repeat in 2018).\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate was 21.6% in 2018 as compared to 43.6% in 2017. The decrease is primarily attributable to the absence of the $56.5 million provisional income tax expense associated with the TCJA recognized in the 2017 financial statements, the reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and net favorable adjustments to the 2017 provisional income tax expense associated with TCJA recognized in the current year.\nDuring 2018, the Company completed its analysis of the specific income tax effects of TCJA and recorded a net tax benefit of approximately $6 million related to adjustments to the prior provisional estimates and to record amounts related to items for which a prior provisional estimate had not been made. Additional information related to the Company's effective tax rate is included in Note 13 - Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNet Income Attributable to Hubbell and Earnings Per Diluted Share\nNet income attributable to Hubbell was $360.2 million in 2018 and increased 48% as compared to 2017. The increase reflects a lower effective tax rate, higher operating income and the loss on extinguishment of debt in 2017 (which did not repeat in 2018), offset partially by higher interest expense. Adjusted net income attributable to Hubbell was $401.7 million in 2018 and increased 29% as compared to 2017. Earnings per diluted share in 2018 increased 49% compared to 2017. Adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2018 increased 29% as compared to 2017.\nSegment Results\nElectrical Segment\n\nNet sales in the Electrical segment were $2.7 billion, up five percent in 2018 as compared with 2017 due to approximately five percentage points of net sales growth from higher organic volume, including favorable price realization for the segment. Acquisitions increased net sales by less than one percentage point and the effect of foreign currency translation was flat.\nWithin the segment, the aggregate net sales of our Commercial and Industrial and Construction and Energy business groups increased by seven percentage points, due to approximately six percentage points of organic growth, and approximately one percentage point of net sales growth from acquisitions. Organic net sales growth of these businesses was driven primarily by our products serving the energy-related markets as well as the non-residential and residential construction markets. Net sales of our Lighting business group increased approximately two percent in 2018 due to higher organic volume, partially offset by pricing headwinds. Within the Lighting business group, net sales of residential lighting products increased by 12%, driven by strong unit volume growth, while net sales of commercial and industrial lighting products declined by 2% as a result of lower volume and pricing headwinds.\nOperating income in the Electrical segment for 2018 was $320.8 million and increased nine percent compared to 2017. Operating margin in 2018 increased by 50 basis points to 12.1%. The increase in operating margin is primarily due to incremental earnings on higher net sales, as discussed above, and productivity gains in excess of cost increases, partially offset by material cost headwinds (including the impact of Tariffs) that outpaced price realization.\nPower Segment\n\n HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K 23 \nNet sales for 2018 in the Power segment were $1.8 billion, up approximately 60% as compared to 2017, primarily due to the addition of net sales of the Aclara business as well as higher organic volume. Acquisitions contributed 56.6% to net sales growth and higher organic volume contributed 4.1%, including favorable price realization. Organic net sales growth was driven by the transmission and distribution (T&D) and telecommunications markets. Foreign exchange reduced net sales as compared to the prior year by less than one percentage point.\nOperating income in the Power segment for 2018 increased by five percent to $236.1 million as compared to the prior year. Operating margin in 2018 decreased to 13.0% as compared to 19.8% in 2017 and reflects an approximately 2% decline from higher Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs in 2018, as well as approximately 2% attributable to the lower margin operating results of the Aclara business. The decrease in operating margin also reflects a net headwind from material cost increases (including the impact of Tariffs) that outpaced price realization, and the absence of a one-time benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nNet Sales\nNet sales of $3.7 billion in 2017 increased approximately five percent as compared to 2016. Acquisitions added two percentage points to net sales in 2017 and organic volume, including the impact of pricing headwinds, added three percentage points. Within our Electrical segment, organic net sales growth came primarily from products sold into the energy-related, non-residential and residential construction markets. Organic net sales within our Power segment increased by six percentage points primarily driven by growth in the electrical transmission and distribution market.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales in 2017 was 68.5% and was flat as compared to 2016. Price and material cost headwinds as well as a 30 basis point headwind from acquisitions, were offset by gains from productivity initiatives that exceeded cost inflation, greater realized savings from our restructuring and related actions and lower restructuring and related costs in 2017.\nThe headwind from acquisitions includes our investment in IoT capabilities in 2017 through the acquisition of iDevices.\nGross Profit\nThe gross profit margin for 2017 was 31.5% and was flat as compared to 2016, driven by costs of goods sold discussed above.\nSelling & Administrative Expenses\nS&A expense in 2017 was $636.3 million and increased by $21.0 million compared to the same period of the prior year. S&A expense as a percentage of net sales declined by 20 basis points to 17.3% in 2017. Excluding Aclara transaction costs, adjusted S&A expense as a percentage of net sales declined by 30 basis points to 17.2% in 2017 primarily due to higher net sales volume and greater realized savings from our restructuring and related actions, partially offset by acquisitions, which increased the adjusted S&A expense as a percentage of net sales by approximately 10 basis points.\nOperating Income\nOperating income increased six percent in 2017 to $518.8 million and operating margin increased by 10 basis points to 14.1%. Excluding Aclara transaction costs, adjusted operating income in 2017 was $525.5 million and the adjusted operating margin increased by 30 basis points to 14.3%. That increase was primarily due to greater realized savings from our restructuring and related actions and lower restructuring and related costs, productivity initiatives in excess of cost inflation as well as from incremental earnings on higher net sales volume. The benefit from those items was partially offset by price and material cost headwinds as well as a 40 basis point headwind from acquisitions, including our investment in IoT capabilities through the acquisition of iDevices.\nTotal Other Expense\nTotal other expense was $75.7 million in 2017 compared to $59.4 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $10.1 million pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of long-term debt recognized in 2017 and higher foreign exchange losses in 2017 partially offset by the write-off of an escrow receivable in 2016 associated with a prior acquisition. This escrow receivable write off had no effect on net income of the prior year as it was offset in income taxes by the release of a related liability.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate was 43.6% in 2017 and includes the provisional impact of the TCJA to the 2017 financial statements. Excluding the provisional impact of TCJA, the effective tax rate was 30.8% and was flat compared to the prior year. The favorable impact resulted primarily from the income tax effects of share based awards and settlement of a tax examination in 2017 offset by the impact of return to provision adjustments and other favorable discrete items realized in the prior year that did not repeat in the current year, including the release of a liability in 2016 caused by the expiration of certain statute of limitations associated with an uncertain tax position from a prior acquisition.\n 24 HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K \nNet Income attributable to Hubbell and Earnings Per Diluted Share\nNet income attributable to Hubbell was $243.1 million in 2017 and decreased 17% as compared to 2016. Adjusted net income attributable to Hubbell was $311.9 million in 2017 and increased 6% as compared to 2016. Earnings per diluted share in 2017 decreased 16% compared to 2016. Adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2017 increased 8% and reflects the increase in adjusted operating income in 2017 as well as a 0.6 million decline in the average number of diluted shares outstanding as compared to the prior year.\nSegment Results\nElectrical Segment\n\nNet sales in the Electrical segment were $2.5 billion, up three percent in 2017 as compared with 2016 due to two percentage points of net sales growth from higher organic volume, including the impact of pricing headwinds, and one percentage point contributed by acquisitions.\nWithin the segment, the aggregate net sales of our Commercial and Industrial and Construction and Energy business groups increased by six percentage points, due to four percentage points of organic growth, and two percentage points of net sales growth from acquisitions. Organic net sales growth of these businesses was driven primarily by our products serving the energy-related markets as well as the non-residential and residential construction markets. Net sales of our Lighting business group decreased one percent in 2017 as two percentage points of headwind from pricing, was only partially offset by one percentage point of volume growth. Within the Lighting business group, net sales of residential lighting products increased by three percent, while net sales of commercial and industrial lighting products declined by two percentage points, primarily due to headwinds on pricing.\nOperating income in the Electrical segment for 2017 was $294.0 million and increased 6.4% compared to 2016. Operating margin in 2017 increased 40 basis points compared to 2016 as greater realized savings from our restructuring and related actions, lower restructuring and related costs, and the benefit from higher net sales volume, were partially offset by price and material cost headwinds and acquisitions. Acquisitions reduced the adjusted operating margin by approximately 50 basis points in 2017, and includes our investment in IoT capabilities through the acquisition of iDevices.\nPower Segment\n\nNet sales in the Power segment were $1.1 billion, up nine percent compared to 2016, primarily due to higher organic volume and net sales from acquisitions. The increase in organic volume contributed six percentage points driven by growth in the distribution and telecommunications markets, including storm-related sales associated with hurricanes in 2017, and acquisitions which contributed three percentage points to net sales growth.\nOperating income in the Power segment increased 5.3 percent to $224.8 million in 2017. Operating margin in 2017 decreased by 60 basis points to 19.8% primarily due to price and material cost headwinds, Aclara transaction costs, and higher restructuring and related costs. The impact of those items was partially offset by gains from productivity initiatives in excess of cost inflation as well as from incremental earnings on higher net sales volume. In 2016, operating margin included a benefit within cost inflation from the reduction of an environmental liability, and in 2017 operating margin includes a similarly-sized benefit within cost inflation from an insurance recovery.\n HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K 25 \nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\n \nCash Flow\n\nComparable periods have been recast to reflect the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement for share-based payments (ASU 2016-09).\nThe following table reconciles our cash flows from operating activities to free cash flows for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):\n\n(1) Free cash flow as a percent of net income attributable to Hubbell, includes the approximately $57 million impact of the TCJA in 2017. Free cash flow as a percentage of net income attributable to Hubbell excluding the impact of the TCJA is approximately 100% in 2017.\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful information", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nExecutive Overview of the Business\n \nThe Company is primarily engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of quality electrical and electronic products for a broad range of non-residential and residential construction, industrial and utility applications.

Aclara is a leading global provider of smart infrastructure solutions for electric, gas, and water utilities, with advanced metering solutions and grid monitoring sensor technology, as well as leading software enabled installation services. The acquisition extends the Power segment's capabilities into smart automation technologies, accelerates ongoing innovation efforts to address utility customer demand for data and integrated solutions, and expands the segment's reach to a broader set of utility customers.\nFor additional information about the Aclara acquisition, refer to Note 3 - Business Acquisitions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K 19 \nResults of Operations\n \nOur operations are classified into two reportable segments: Electrical and Power. For a complete description of the Company's segments, see Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Within these segments, Hubbell serves customers in five primary end markets; non-residential construction, residential construction, industrial, energy-related markets (also referred to as oil and gas markets) and utility markets (also referred to as the electrical transmission and distribution (T&D) market). In order of magnitude of net sales, the Company's served markets are electrical T&D, non-residential construction, industrial, oil and gas, and residential construction.\nOur end markets experienced strong growth in 2018, driving organic net sales growth of 4.4%, including the traction we gained in the latter half of the year on price realization. We saw notable strength in 2018 in energy-related markets, including gas distribution, the core industrial market, and non-residential markets, as well as growth within the residential lighting market that accelerated in the second half of the year. Utility markets grew primarily within T&D and outside-the-plant telecommunications.\nNet sales growth from acquisitions was a highlight, as Aclara delivered strong revenue performance in 2018, demand for its products was strong and the Aclara acquisition has added a robust backlog and project pipeline.\nEarnings growth was also strong as our operating income grew by seven percent in 2018; however, inflationary pressures and material cost increases, including tariffs, pressured operating margins. During the second half of 2018, many of our businesses took pricing actions to mitigate the impact of material cost increases and the effect of Section 301 tariffs resulting from changes in U.S. trade policy in 2018 (the \"Tariffs\" referred to in the following discussion of results of operations). See Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" for additional discussion of developments stemming from the recent and potential changes in trade policies.\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, each grew by 29% in 2018 and reflect our strong operating income performance as well as the benefit of a lower effective tax rate resulting from the enactment of the TCJA.\nSUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ending December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Net sales\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Net sales\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Net sales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,481.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,668.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,505.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>3,181.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2,513.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2,400.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>1,300.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1,155.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1,105.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling & administrative expenses\n</td> <td>743.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>636.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>615.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>556.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>518.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>489.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Hubbell\n</td> <td>360.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>243.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>293.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EARNINGS PER SHARE - DILUTED\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the following discussion of results of operations, we refer to \"adjusted\" operating measures. We believe those adjusted measures, which exclude the impact of certain costs, may provide investors with useful information regarding our underlying performance from period to period and allow investors to understand our results of operations without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. Management uses these adjusted measures when assessing the performance of the business.\nOur adjusted operating measures exclude the income tax effects associated with U.S. tax reform recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017, Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs recognized in 2017 and 2018, and the loss on extinguishment of debt incurred in the third quarter of 2017, as further explained below, and as shown in the reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures that follow. However, the net tax benefit of approximately $6 million related to adjustments made in connection with the Company's accounting for the effects of TCJA during the measurement period in 2018 has not been reflected as an adjustment to the GAAP measures and is therefore not a reconciling item in the adjusted operating measures below.\n 20 HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K \nAclara acquisition-related and transaction costs\nAclara acquisition-related and transaction costs include the amortization of identified intangible assets and inventory step-up amortization expense. Aclara transaction costs are primarily for professional services and other fees incurred to complete the acquisition as well as certain financing costs recognized in interest expense in connection with the transaction. The effect of Aclara inventory step-up amortization expense and transaction costs are complete as of December 31, 2018. See Note 3 - Business Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information and further discussion of Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs. Only a portion of the Aclara transaction costs are expected to be tax deductible.\nLoss on the early extinguishment of debt\nOur consolidated results of operations in 2017 include a $10.1 million pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of long-term debt from the redemption of all of our $300 million outstanding long-term unsecured, unsubordinated notes that were scheduled to mature in 2018.\nThe following table provides the Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 by type and by location in the Consolidated Statement of Income (in millions):\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aclara acquisition-related costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aclara transaction costs\n</td> <td>12.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&A expense\n</td> <td>20.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n HUBBELL INCORPORATED -

Acquisitions added 17.8% to net sales, primarily from the acquisition of Aclara, while organic volume, including favorable price realization, contributed 4.4%. The effect of foreign exchange was flat compared to the prior year.\nCost of Goods Sold\nAs a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold increased by 250 basis points to 71.0% of net sales in 2018 as compared to 68.5% in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by acquisitions, as 2018 includes $29.5 million of Aclara acquisition-related costs as well as the effect of adding the operating results of Aclara, which carries a relatively higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales (and lower gross margin) as compared to the legacy Hubbell business. The increase also reflects an unfavorable net impact of price and material costs, as rising material costs and the impact of Tariffs outpaced favorable price realization.\nGross Profit\nGross profit margin in 2018 compared to 2017 declined by 250 basis points to 29.0% of net sales, driven by costs of goods sold discussed above. Excluding Aclara acquisition-related costs, the adjusted gross profit margin was 29.7% in 2018 as compared to 31.5% in 2017.\nSelling & Administrative Expenses\nS&A expense in 2018 was $743.5 million and increased by $107.2 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the addition of S&A costs of Aclara, including $20.8 million of Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs. S&A expense as a percentage of net sales declined by 70 basis points to 16.6% in 2018. Excluding Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs, adjusted S&A expense as a percentage of net sales declined by 110 basis points to 16.1% in 2018 primarily due to volume leverage associated with higher net sales.\nOperating Income\nOperating income increased seven percent in 2018 to $556.9 million, primarily driven by the operating results of the Aclara business, including acquisition-related and transaction costs. The increase in operating income from higher net sales volume was largely offset by rising material costs and the impact of Tariffs, which together, outpaced favorable price realization.\n 22 HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K \nOperating margin decreased by 170 basis points to 12.4% due to higher Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs in 2018 as well as the operating results of the Aclara business, which carries a relatively lower gross margin as compared to the legacy Hubbell results. The decrease in operating margin also reflects the impact of material costs, tariffs and price realization noted above, which together were only partially offset by the benefit from higher net sales volume.\nExcluding Aclara Acquisition-related and transaction costs, adjusted operating income increased 15.5% percent in 2018 to $607.2 million and adjusted operating margin declined by 80 basis points to 13.5% in 2018.\nTotal Other Expense\nTotal other expense in 2018 was $89.9 million and increased by $14.2 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher interest expense from the issuance of $450 million of 2028 Notes and placement of the $500 million Term Loan, each in the first quarter of 2018, to finance the Aclara acquisition, partially offset by the loss on extinguishment of debt recognized in 2017 (which did not repeat in 2018).\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate was 21.6% in 2018 as compared to 43.6% in 2017. The decrease is primarily attributable to the absence of the $56.5 million provisional income tax expense associated with the TCJA recognized in the 2017 financial statements, the reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and net favorable adjustments to the 2017 provisional income tax expense associated with TCJA recognized in the current year.\nDuring 2018, the Company completed its analysis of the specific income tax effects of TCJA and recorded a net tax benefit of approximately $6 million related to adjustments to the prior provisional estimates and to record amounts related to items for which a prior provisional estimate had not been made. Additional information related to the Company's effective tax rate is included in Note 13 - Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNet Income Attributable to Hubbell and Earnings Per Diluted Share\nNet income attributable to Hubbell was $360.2 million in 2018 and increased 48% as compared to 2017. The increase reflects a lower effective tax rate, higher operating income and the loss on extinguishment of debt in 2017 (which did not repeat in 2018), offset partially by higher interest expense. Adjusted net income attributable to Hubbell was $401.7 million in 2018 and increased 29% as compared to 2017. Earnings per diluted share in 2018 increased 49% compared to 2017. Adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2018 increased 29% as compared to 2017.\nSegment Results\nElectrical Segment\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,660.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,532.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>320.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>294.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales in the Electrical segment were $2.7 billion, up five percent in 2018 as compared with 2017 due to approximately five percentage points of net sales growth from higher organic volume, including favorable price realization for the segment. Acquisitions increased net sales by less than one percentage point and the effect of foreign currency translation was flat.\nWithin the segment, the aggregate net sales of our Commercial and Industrial and Construction and Energy business groups increased by seven percentage points, due to approximately six percentage points of organic growth, and approximately one percentage point of net sales growth from acquisitions. Organic net sales growth of these businesses was driven primarily by our products serving the energy-related markets as well as the non-residential and residential construction markets. Net sales of our Lighting business group increased approximately two percent in 2018 due to higher organic volume, partially offset by pricing headwinds. Within the Lighting business group, net sales of residential lighting products increased by 12%, driven by strong unit volume growth, while net sales of commercial and industrial lighting products declined by 2% as a result of lower volume and pricing headwinds.\nOperating income in the Electrical segment for 2018 was $320.8 million and increased nine percent compared to 2017. Operating margin in 2018 increased by 50 basis points to 12.1%. The increase in operating margin is primarily due to incremental earnings on higher net sales, as discussed above, and productivity gains in excess of cost increases, partially offset by material cost headwinds (including the impact of Tariffs) that outpaced price realization.\nPower Segment\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,821.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,136.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>224.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs\n</td> <td>50.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>286.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>19.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating margin\n</td> <td>15.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K 23 \nNet sales for 2018 in the Power segment were $1.8 billion, up approximately 60% as compared to 2017, primarily due to the addition of net sales of the Aclara business as well as higher organic volume. Acquisitions contributed 56.6% to net sales growth and higher organic volume contributed 4.1%, including favorable price realization. Organic net sales growth was driven by the transmission and distribution (T&D) and telecommunications markets. Foreign exchange reduced net sales as compared to the prior year by less than one percentage point.\nOperating income in the Power segment for 2018 increased by five percent to $236.1 million as compared to the prior year. Operating margin in 2018 decreased to 13.0% as compared to 19.8% in 2017 and reflects an approximately 2% decline from higher Aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs in 2018, as well as approximately 2% attributable to the lower margin operating results of the Aclara business. The decrease in operating margin also reflects a net headwind from material cost increases (including the impact of Tariffs) that outpaced price realization, and the absence of a one-time benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nNet Sales\nNet sales of $3.7 billion in 2017 increased approximately five percent as compared to 2016. Acquisitions added two percentage points to net sales in 2017 and organic volume, including the impact of pricing headwinds, added three percentage points. Within our Electrical segment, organic net sales growth came primarily from products sold into the energy-related, non-residential and residential construction markets. Organic net sales within our Power segment increased by six percentage points primarily driven by growth in the electrical transmission and distribution market.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales in 2017 was 68.5% and was flat as compared to 2016. Price and material cost headwinds as well as a 30 basis point headwind from acquisitions, were offset by gains from productivity initiatives that exceeded cost inflation, greater realized savings from our restructuring and related actions and lower restructuring and related costs in 2017.\nThe headwind from acquisitions includes our investment in IoT capabilities in 2017 through the acquisition of iDevices.\nGross Profit\nThe gross profit margin for 2017 was 31.5% and was flat as compared to 2016, driven by costs of goods sold discussed above.\nSelling & Administrative Expenses\nS&A expense in 2017 was $636.3 million and increased by $21.0 million compared to the same period of the prior year. S&A expense as a percentage of net sales declined by 20 basis points to 17.3% in 2017. Excluding Aclara transaction costs, adjusted S&A expense as a percentage of net sales declined by 30 basis points to 17.2% in 2017 primarily due to higher net sales volume and greater realized savings from our restructuring and related actions, partially offset by acquisitions, which increased the adjusted S&A expense as a percentage of net sales by approximately 10 basis points.\nOperating Income\nOperating income increased six percent in 2017 to $518.8 million and operating margin increased by 10 basis points to 14.1%. Excluding Aclara transaction costs, adjusted operating income in 2017 was $525.5 million and the adjusted operating margin increased by 30 basis points to 14.3%. That increase was primarily due to greater realized savings from our restructuring and related actions and lower restructuring and related costs, productivity initiatives in excess of cost inflation as well as from incremental earnings on higher net sales volume. The benefit from those items was partially offset by price and material cost headwinds as well as a 40 basis point headwind from acquisitions, including our investment in IoT capabilities through the acquisition of iDevices.\nTotal Other Expense\nTotal other expense was $75.7 million in 2017 compared to $59.4 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $10.1 million pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of long-term debt recognized in 2017 and higher foreign exchange losses in 2017 partially offset by the write-off of an escrow receivable in 2016 associated with a prior acquisition. This escrow receivable write off had no effect on net income of the prior year as it was offset in income taxes by the release of a related liability.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate was 43.6% in 2017 and includes the provisional impact of the TCJA to the 2017 financial statements. Excluding the provisional impact of TCJA, the effective tax rate was 30.8% and was flat compared to the prior year. The favorable impact resulted primarily from the income tax effects of share based awards and settlement of a tax examination in 2017 offset by the impact of return to provision adjustments and other favorable discrete items realized in the prior year that did not repeat in the current year, including the release of a liability in 2016 caused by the expiration of certain statute of limitations associated with an uncertain tax position from a prior acquisition.\n 24 HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K \nNet Income attributable to Hubbell and Earnings Per Diluted Share\nNet income attributable to Hubbell was $243.1 million in 2017 and decreased 17% as compared to 2016.

Organic net sales growth of these businesses was driven primarily by our products serving the energy-related markets as well as the non-residential and residential construction markets. Net sales of our Lighting business group decreased one percent in 2017 as two percentage points of headwind from pricing, was only partially offset by one percentage point of volume growth. Within the Lighting business group, net sales of residential lighting products increased by three percent, while net sales of commercial and industrial lighting products declined by two percentage points, primarily due to headwinds on pricing.\nOperating income in the Electrical segment for 2017 was $294.0 million and increased 6.4% compared to 2016. Operating margin in 2017 increased 40 basis points compared to 2016 as greater realized savings from our restructuring and related actions, lower restructuring and related costs, and the benefit from higher net sales volume, were partially offset by price and material cost headwinds and acquisitions. Acquisitions reduced the adjusted operating margin by approximately 50 basis points in 2017, and includes our investment in IoT capabilities through the acquisition of iDevices.\nPower Segment\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,136.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,045.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>224.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>213.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aclara transaction costs\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>213.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>19.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating margin\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales in the Power segment were $1.1 billion, up nine percent compared to 2016, primarily due to higher organic volume and net sales from acquisitions. The increase in organic volume contributed six percentage points driven by growth in the distribution and telecommunications markets, including storm-related sales associated with hurricanes in 2017, and acquisitions which contributed three percentage points to net sales growth.\nOperating income in the Power segment increased 5.3 percent to $224.8 million in 2017. Operating margin in 2017 decreased by 60 basis points to 19.8% primarily due to price and material cost headwinds, Aclara transaction costs, and higher restructuring and related costs. The impact of those items was partially offset by gains from productivity initiatives in excess of cost inflation as well as from incremental earnings on higher net sales volume. In 2016, operating margin included a benefit within cost inflation from the reduction of an environmental liability, and in 2017 operating margin includes a similarly-sized benefit within cost inflation from an insurance recovery.\n HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K 25 \nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\n \nCash Flow\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>517.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>379.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>411.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(1,201.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(245.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(230.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>506.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(214.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(59.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(8.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>18.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(186.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(62.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparable periods have been recast to reflect the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement for share-based payments (ASU 2016-09).\nThe following table reconciles our cash flows from operating activities to free cash flows for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>517.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>379.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>411.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>(96.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(79.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(67.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>420.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>299.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>343.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow as a percent of net income attributable to Hubbell (1)\n</td> <td>116.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>123.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>117.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Free cash flow as a percent of net income attributable to Hubbell, includes the approximately $57 million impact of the TCJA in 2017.
