MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGENERAL\nThe following discussion sets forth management's discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations that should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, related notes, the selected financial data and the statistical information presented elsewhere in this report for a more complete understanding of the following discussion and analysis. Unless otherwise noted, years refer to the Company's fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.\nRESTATEMENT SUMMARY\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, includes restatement of\nour previously filed consolidated financial statements and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 as well as revised quarterly results of operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2016. The prior period errors were discovered in connection with the annual audit of consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Management determined that certain professional and other expense accrual items were overstated during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 resulting in understatement of the Company's net income for the quarterly and annual periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2015. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, management reversed these overstated accrued expenses which resulted in an overstatement of quarterly and annual net income for the year ended September 30, 2016. The cumulative effect of the net over-accruals of certain expenses for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 was that net income was understated by $726 and $192 respectively. The effect of these restatements on the Company's 2016 and 2015 quarterly consolidated statements of operations, as reported on Forms 10-Q, are as follows: Total non-interest expense decreased by $60 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015; and decreased by $85 for each of the quarters ended June 30, 2015; March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Net income increased by $36 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015; and increased by $52 for each of the quarters ended June 30, 2015; March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Total non-interest expense increased by $151, $43, and $21 for the quarters ended June 30, 2016; March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Net income decreased by $92, $26, and $13 for the quarters ended June 30, 2016; March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The effects of the restatements on the Company's balance sheets and statements of cash flows for the Restated Periods were not material. For further detail regarding the restatement of the financial statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2015, see Note 2, Financial Restatements, to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. For the revised quarterly results of operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, see Selected Quarterly Financial Data\u201d under Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nWe believe that presenting all of this information regarding the Restated Periods in this Annual Report allows investors to\nreview all pertinent data in a single presentation. We have not filed amendments to our annual or quarterly reports for the fiscal\nyears ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 or quarterly reports for the quarterly periods ended December 31, 2015, March 31,\n2016 and June 30, 2016 or the preliminary earnings release for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016 furnished on an\nForm 8-K filed on October 28, 2016 (collectively, the Affected Reports\u201d). Accordingly, investors should rely only on the\nfinancial information and other disclosures regarding the Restated Periods in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and not on the\nAffected Reports or any reports, earnings releases or similar communications relating to those periods.\nPERFORMANCE SUMMARY\nThe following is a brief summary of some of the significant factors that affected our operating results in 2016. See the remainder of this section for a more thorough discussion. Unless otherwise stated, all monetary amounts in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, other than share, per share and capital ratio amounts, are stated in thousands.\nWe reported net income of $2,573 for the year ended September 30, 2016, compared to net income of $2,806 for the year ended September 30, 2015. Diluted earnings per share were $0.49 for 2016 compared to $0.54 for the year ended September 30, 2015. Return on average assets for the year ended September 30, 2016 was 0.40%, compared to 0.49% for the year ended September 30, 2015. The return on average equity was 4.08% for 2016 and 4.70% for 2015. An annual cash\ndividend in the amount of $0.12 per share and $0.08 per share was paid in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nKey factors behind the earnings results were:\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net interest income was $20,077 for 2016, an increase of $1,511, or 8.14% from $18,566 for 2015, due to an increase in the level of interest earning assets related to the acquisition of CBN. Interest income increased to $25,084 from $23,004, or 9.04% from 2015 to 2016.

The increased loan and deposit balances largely relate to the CBN acquisition.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Accounting Standards Generally Accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") as applied in the United States. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. Some of these estimates are more critical than others. Below is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates\nAllowance for Loan Losses.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable and inherent losses in our loan portfolio. The allowance is based on ongoing, quarterly assessments of the estimated probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio. In evaluating the level of the allowance for loan loss, we consider the types of loans and the amount of loans in our loan portfolio, historical loss experience, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions and other relevant factors determined by management. We follow all applicable regulatory guidance, including the Interagency Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses,\u201d issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). We believe that the Bank's Allowance for Loan Losses Policy conforms to all applicable regulatory requirements. However, based on periodic examinations by regulators, the amount of the allowance for loan losses recorded during a particular period may be adjusted.\nOur determination of the allowance for loan losses is based on (1) specific allowances for specifically identified and evaluated impaired loans and their corresponding estimated loss based on likelihood of default, payment history, and net realizable value of underlying collateral. Specific allocations for collateral dependent loans are based on fair value of the underlying collateral relative to the unpaid principal balance of individually impaired loans. For loans that are not collateral dependent, the specific allocation is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate through the repayment period; and (2) a general allowance on loans not specifically identified in (1) above, based on historical loss ratios, which are adjusted for qualitative and general economic factors. We continue to refine our allowance for loan losses methodology, with an increased emphasis on historical performance adjusted for applicable economic and qualitative factors.\nAssessing the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires making material estimates, including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans, any of which estimates may be susceptible to significant change. In our opinion, the allowance, when taken as a whole, reflects estimated probable loan losses in our loan portfolio.\nGoodwill.\nGoodwill resulting from the acquisition by merger of CBN was determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, over the fair value of the net assets acquired, less liabilities assumed in the acquisition by merger, as of the acquisition date. Goodwill resulting from the selective purchase of loans and deposits from Central Bank in February 2016 was determined as the excess of the Premium Deposit less the Core Deposit Intangible as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is determined to have an indefinite useful life, and is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances exist that indicate that a goodwill impairment test should be performed.\nFair Value Measurements and Valuation Methodologies.\nWe apply various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as most investment securities. However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include loans, deposits, borrowings, goodwill, core deposit intangible assets, other assets and liabilities obtained or assumed in business combinations, and certain other financial instruments. These valuations require the use of various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or disclosures of fair value information.\nIn addition to valuation, the Company must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of assets that should be considered other than temporary or otherwise require an adjustment in carrying value and recognition of a loss in the consolidated statement of income. Examples include but are not limited to; loans, investment securities, goodwill, core deposit intangible assets and deferred tax assets, among others. Specific assumptions, estimates and judgments utilized by management are discussed in detail herein in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 15 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes.\nAmounts provided for income tax expenses are based on income reported for financial statement purposes and do not necessarily represent amounts currently payable under tax laws. Deferred income taxes, which arise principally from temporary differences between the amounts reported in the financial statements and the tax basis of certain assets and liabilities, are included in the amounts provided for income taxes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and tax planning strategies which will create taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and if necessary, tax planning strategies in making this assessment.\nThe assessment of tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates, assumptions, interpretations, and judgments concerning certain accounting pronouncements and application of specific provisions of federal and state tax codes. There can be no assurance that future events, such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing authorities, will not differ from management's current assessment, the impact of which could be material to our consolidated results of our operations and reported earnings. We believe that the deferred tax assets and liabilities are adequate and properly recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2016, management does not believe a valuation allowance related to the realizability of its deferred tax assets is necessary.\nSTATEMENT OF OPERATIONS ANALYSIS\n2016 compared to 2015\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income represents the difference between the dollar amount of interest earned on interest bearing assets and the dollar amount of interest paid on interest bearing liabilities. The interest income and expense of financial institutions are significantly affected by general economic conditions, competition, policies of regulatory authorities and other factors.\nInterest rate spread and net interest margin are used to measure and explain changes in net interest income. Interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the rate paid for interest bearing liabilities that fund\nthose assets. Net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average interest earning assets. Net interest margin exceeds interest rate spread because non-interest bearing sources of funds ( net free funds\u201d), principally demand deposits and stockholders' equity, also support interest earning assets. The narrative below discusses net interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin.\nTax equivalent net interest income was $20,344 for 2016, compared to $18,698 for 2015. Interest income on tax exempt securities is computed on a tax equivalent basis. The net interest margin for 2016 was 3.27% compared to 3.36% for 2015. The 9 bp decrease in net interest margin was mainly attributable to a 9 bp decrease in yield on loans as many loans have repriced or been originated in a lower interest rate environment. Competitive pricing on new and refinanced loans resulted in loan volume at lower rates, as well as increased refinancing of one to four family loans due to the current low rate environment, both contributed to reduced loan yields in 2016. Partially offsetting the decline in loan yields, was a 5 bp increase in the yield on investment securities. The investment securities yield increased through the purchase of higher yielding non-taxable municipal investment grade securities.\nThe cost of deposits increased slightly in 2016 to 0.88% from 0.87% in 2015. The slight increase reflects a larger balance of certificates of deposit acquired in the CBN acquisition.\nCompetitive pricing on new and refinanced loans resulted in loan volume at lower rates, as well as increased refinancing of one to four family loans due to the current low rate environment, both contributed to reduced loan yields in 2016. Certain FHLB advances were purchased, with shorter term maturities and lower interest rates than in the previous fiscal year, offset by longer term, higher rate borrowings used to finance the acquisition of CBN and certain deposits from closed branches were replaced with higher rate interest bearing deposits, causing the increase in rates on our interest-bearing liabilities.\nAs shown in the rate/volume analysis table below, positive volume changes resulted in a $1,987 increase in net interest income in 2016. Average loan volume increases were due to commercial real estate and non-real estate loan growth in the current fiscal year over the prior fiscal year, arising from management's strategy to continue to diversify its credit portfolio. The increase and changes in the composition of interest earning assets resulted in a $2,215 increase in interest income for 2016, and a $569 increase in interest expense due to the composition change in interest bearing liabilities. Rate changes on interest earning assets caused a decrease in interest income by $309 and increased interest expense by $32, for a net impact of a $341 decrease in net interest income between 2016 and 2015.\nAverage Balances, Net Interest Income, Yields Earned and Rates Paid. The following table shows tax equivalent interest income from average interest earning assets, expressed in dollars and yields, and interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities, expressed in dollars and rates. Also presented is the weighted average yield on interest earning assets, rates paid on interest bearing liabilities and the resultant spread at September 30 for each of the last two fiscal years. Non-accruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.\nAverage interest earning assets were $621,571 in 2016 compared to $556,937 in 2015. Average loans outstanding increased to $504,972 in 2016 from $457,707 in 2015. Interest income on loans increased $1,766, of which $2,198 related to the increase in average outstanding balances, offset by a reduction in interest income due to lower yields on such loans in the amount of $432.\nAverage interest bearing liabilities increased $55,528 in 2016 from their 2015 levels. The increase in average interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to deposits acquired in the CBN acquisition and borrowings used to facilitate the purchase. Average interest bearing deposits increased $41,870, or 9.61% to $477,571 in 2016. Interest expense on interest bearing deposits increased $370 during 2016 from the volume and mix changes and increased $22 from the impact of the rate environment, resulting in an aggregate increase of $392 in interest expense on interest bearing deposits.\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

and 2015, the average balance of the tax exempt investment securities, included in investment securities, were $29,232 and $15,019 respectively. The interest income on tax exempt securities is computed on a tax-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 34% for all periods presented.\nRate/Volume Analysis. The following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for the components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that are presented in the preceding table. For each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to: (1) changes in volume, which are changes in the average outstanding balances multiplied by the prior period rate (i.e. holding the initial rate constant); and (2) changes in rate, which are changes in average interest rates multiplied by the prior period volume (i.e. holding the initial balance constant). Changes due to both rate and volume which cannot be segregated have been allocated in proportion to the relationship of the dollar amounts of the change in each. As shown in the rate/volume analysis table below, positive volume changes resulted in a $1,987 increase in net interest income in 2016. Average loan volume increases were due largely to the acquisition of CBN. The increase and changes in the composition of interest earning assets resulted in a $2,215 increase in interest income for 2016, and a $569 increase in interest expense due to the acquisition. Rate changes on interest earning assets caused a decrease in interest income by $309 and increased interest expense by $32, for a net impact of a $341 decrease in net interest income between 2016 and 2015.\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended September 30,\n2016 v. 2015\nIncrease (decrease) due to\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Volume (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\nIncrease /\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(432\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest bearing deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>348\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-marketable equity securities, at cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest earning assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(309\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Demand deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Money market accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CD's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IRA's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB Advances and other borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest bearing liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>569\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(341\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>the change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated in proportion to the relationship to the dollar amounts of the change in each.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvision for Loan Losses. We determine our provision for loan losses ( provision\u201d, or PLL\u201d) based on our desire to provide an adequate allowance for loan losses ( ALL\u201d) to reflect probable and inherent credit losses in our loan portfolio.\nNet loan charge-offs for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $503 and $666, respectively. Net charge-offs to average loans were 0.10% for 2016 compared to 0.14% for 2015. For 2016, non-performing loans increased by $2,350 to $3,571 from $1,221 at September 30, 2015. Refer to the Risk Management and the Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d section below for more information related to non-performing loans.\nWe recorded provisions for loan losses of $75 and $656 for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Management believes that the provision taken for the year ended September 30, 2016 is adequate in view of the present condition of the Bank's loan portfolio and the sufficiency of collateral supporting non-performing loans. We are continually monitoring non-performing loan relationships and will make provisions, as necessary, if the facts and circumstances change. In addition, a decline in the quality of our loan portfolio as a result of general economic conditions, factors affecting particular\nborrowers or our market areas, or other factors could all affect the adequacy of our ALL. If there are significant charge-offs against the ALL, or we otherwise determine that the ALL is inadequate, we will need to record an additional PLL in the future. See Note 1 Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for further analysis of the provision for loan losses.\nNon-Interest Income. The following table reflects the various components of non-interest income for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Twelve months ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 over 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest Income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains on available for sale securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan fees and service charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.39\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.68\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nService charges on deposit accounts decreased $88 during 2016 mainly due to a decrease in electronic banking fee and NSF fee income. Loan fees and service charges increased $5 during 2016 mainly due to commercial loan origination and servicing fees.\nNon-Interest Expense.

Occupancy costs, consisting primarily of office rental and depreciation expenses, decreased during the current twelve month period over the same period in the prior year due in part to branch closures. The current year did not reflect a full year of depreciation related to the acquisition of CBN branch facilities. Data processing expenses increased in 2016 due to increased costs associated with converting the CBN system and expenses related to servicing a larger customer base. The amortization of core deposit expenses increased in 2016 due to the establishment of a core deposit intangible and its related amortization. Advertising, marketing and public relations expenses increased during 2016 over 2015 due to expenses associated with rebranding the CBN facilities and marketing the CBN customers. Professional services expense increased in the\ncurrent year due to increased use of outside professionals in connection to the acquisition, relative to the prior year. Other expenses increased in the current twelve month period due to higher insurance costs and contract termination fees as a result of the CBN merger.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax provision was $1,286 for the year ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1,614 for the year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in income tax provision resulted primarily from the decrease in pre-tax income to $3,859 for the year ended September 30, 2016 compared to pre-tax income of $4,420 for 2015. Our effective tax rate declined from 36.5% at September 30, 2015 to 33.3% at September 30, 2016 , as a result of additional purchases of tax exempt security investments.\nSee Note 1, Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 15, Income Taxes\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of income tax accounting. Income tax expense recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations involves interpretation and application of certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes and is, therefore, considered a critical accounting policy. We undergo examination by various taxing authorities. Such taxing authorities may require that changes in the amount of tax expense or the amount of the valuation allowance be recognized when their interpretations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nLoans. Total loans outstanding, net of deferred loan fees and costs, increased to $574,439 at September 30, 2016, a 27.51% increase from their balance of $450,510 at September 30, 2015.

represented by commercial/agricultural real estate loans which increased $89,588. Residential real estate loans increased $6,533 to $187,738 at September 30, 2016. A substantial portion of the increase in real estate loans was related to the acquisition of CBN. Non-real estate loans increased $30,049, or 14.8% from September 30, 2015 to September 30, 2016. Consumer non-real estate loans totaled $188,009 at September 30, 2016, or a decrease of $5,591 from the prior year end. Beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter the company ceased originating loan volume through its indirect dealer network. Commercial non-real estate loans increased $35,638 to $45,648 from $10,010 one year earlier. The change in composition of the loan portfolio over the past year reflects the impact of the CBN acquisition and a termination of the origination of indirect consumer loan products.\nThe following

At September 30, 2016, fixed rate loans were $478,929 while adjustable rate loans were $95,319. Though the balance of fixed rate loans increased due to the CBN acquisition, fixed rate loans declined to 83.4% of gross loans in 2016 compared to 94.2% in 2015. Consumer non-real estate loans represent the largest balance of fixed rate loans at $188,009 at September 30, 2016 followed by residential real estate loans at $173,051, commercial/agricultural real estate loans at $92,030 and commercial/agricultural non-real estate loans at $25,839. Residential real estate loans consist mainly of fixed-rate conventional home mortgages and home equity loans.\nAdjustable rate loans increased $71,413 from $23,906 to $95,319 at September 30, 2016 with the increase due largely to acquired loans through the CBN acquisition. The largest component of the adjustable rate loan portfolio was represented by commercial/agricultural real estate loans at $60,823 at September 30, 2016.\nOur loan portfolio is diversified by types of borrowers and industry groups within the market areas that we serve. Significant loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial entity when the amounts of loans to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. We have identified certain loan types within our loan portfolio, including one to four family real estate loans and consumer loans secured by recreational collateral that represent concentrations in our portfolio. At September 30, 2016, one to four family real estate loans totaled $187,738 or 32.7% of total loans, compared to $181,206 or 40.2% at September 30, 2015. At September 30, 2016, consumer loans secured by recreational collateral totaled $108,253 or 18.9% of total loans, compared to $116,895 or 25.9% of total loans at September 30, 2015. The Bank has ceased originating indirect consumer loans, and therefore will be decreasing its investment in this asset class.\nIn order to limit exposure to interest rate risk, we have developed strategies to shorten the average maturity of our fixed rate loan portfolio by originating shorter term loans, offering new adjustable rate loan products and arranging loan sales of longer term fixed rate loans.\nLoan amounts and their contractual maturities for the years presented are as follows:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

systematic monitoring of existing loans and commitments, effective loan review on an ongoing basis, recording an adequate allowance to provide for incurred loan losses, and reasonable non-accrual and charge-off policies.\nRisk Management and the Allowance for Loan Losses. The loan portfolio is our primary asset subject to credit risk. To address this credit risk, we maintain an ALL for probable and inherent credit losses through periodic charges to our earnings. These charges are shown in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations as Provision for Loan Losses. See Provision for Loan Losses\u201d above. We attempt to control, monitor and minimize credit risk through the use of prudent lending standards, a thorough review of potential borrowers prior to lending and ongoing and timely review of payment performance. Asset quality administration, including early identification of loans performing in a substandard manner, as well as timely and active resolution of problems, further enhances management of credit risk and minimization of loan losses. Any losses that occur and that are charged off against the ALL are periodically reviewed with specific efforts focused on achieving maximum recovery of both principal and interest on the affected loan.\nAt least quarterly, we review the adequacy of the ALL. Based on an estimate computed pursuant to the requirements of ASC 450-10, Accounting for Contingencies\u201d and ASC 310-10, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan\u201d, the analysis of the ALL consists of three components: (i) specific credit allocation established for expected losses relating to specific impaired loans for which the recorded investment in the loan exceeds its fair value; (ii) general portfolio allocation based on historical loan loss experience for significant loan categories; and (iii) general portfolio allocation based on qualitative factors such as economic conditions and other relevant factors specific to the markets in which we operate. We continue to refine our ALL methodology by introducing a greater level of granularity to our loan portfolio. We currently segregate loans into pools based on common risk characteristics for purposes of determining the ALL. The additional segmentation of the portfolio is intended to provide a more effective basis for the determination of qualitative factors affecting our ALL. In\naddition, management continually evaluates our ALL methodology to assess whether modifications in our methodology are appropriate in light of underwriting practices, market conditions, identifiable trends, regulatory pronouncements or other factors. We believe that any modifications or changes to the ALL methodology would be to enhance the accuracy of the ALL. However, any such modifications could result in materially different ALL levels in future periods.\nChanges in the ALL by loan portfolio segment for the years presented were as follows:\nTable 81:

based on a regular analysis of all originated loans that are considered impaired. In compliance with ASC 310-10, the fair value of the loan is determined based on either the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the market price of the loan, or, if the loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of the underlying collateral less the expected cost of sale for such collateral. At September 30, 2016, we had 109 such impaired loans, all secured by real estate or personal property with an aggregate recorded investment of $5,397 See Note 5, Loans, Allowance for Loan Losses and Impaired Loans\u201d of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on what we consider to be impaired loans. The total for the 42 such individual loans where estimated fair value was less than their book value (i.e. we deemed impairment to exist) was $2,412 for which $605 in specific ALL was recorded as of September 30, 2016.\nAt September 30, 2016, there were 56 individual substandard loans, not considered TDRs, with an aggregate recorded investment of $1,664. The total for the 19 such individual loans where estimated fair value was less than their book value (i.e. we deemed impairment to exist) was $297 for which $59 in specific ALL was recorded as of September 30, 2016.\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9/30/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/30/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Quarters ended\n3/31/16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9/30/2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Component 1 - Specific credit allocation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>582\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Component 2 - General and unallocated allowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt September 30, 2016, the allowance for loan losses was $6,068, or 1.06% of our total loan portfolio, compared to an allowance for loan losses of $6,496, or 1.44% of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2015. This level was based on our analysis of the loan portfolio risk at each of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, as discussed above. At September 30, 2016, the ALL was 1.44% of our total loan portfolio, excluding the third party purchased consumer loans referenced elsewhere herein, compared to 1.58% of the total loan portfolio excluding these third party purchased consumer loans at September 30, 2015. We have established a separate restricted reserve account for these third party purchased consumer loans. The funds in the reserve account are to be released to compensate the Bank for any nonperforming purchased loans that are not purchased back by the seller of such loans or substituted with performing loans and are ultimately charged off by the Bank.\nThe Bank increased its commercial and agricultural loan portfolios from last year as part of its strategic plan. The increased loan volume and introduction of new loan products carries an elevated level of risk as the Bank doesn't have a long history in these business lines. However, we believe our current ALL is adequate to cover probable losses in our current loan portfolio.\nAll of the nine factors identified in the FFIEC's Interagency Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses are taken into account in determining the ALL. The impact of the factors in general categories are subject to change; thus the allocations are management's estimate of the loan loss categories in which the probable and inherent loss has occurred as of the date of our assessment. Of the nine factors, we believe the following have the greatest impact on our customers' ability to repay loans and our ability to recover potential losses through collateral sales: (1) lending policies and procedures; (2) economic and business conditions; and (3) the value of the underlying collateral. As loan balances and estimated losses in a particular loan type decrease or increase and as the factors and resulting allocations are monitored by management, changes in the risk profile of the various parts of the loan portfolio may be reflected in the allocated allowance. The general component of our ALL covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for these and other qualitative factors. In addition, management continues to refine the ALL estimation process as new information becomes available. These refinements could also cause increases or decreases in the ALL. The unallocated portion of the ALL is intended to account for imprecision in the estimation process or relevant current information that may not have been considered in the process.\nThe following

consumer loans purchased from a third party. See Note 5 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the separate restricted reserve account established for these purchased consumer loans.\nLoans 90 days or more past due decreased slightly during the year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the comparable prior year period, which management believes is indicative of stabilization of the loan portfolio with seasonal fluctuation, expected quarterly. Nonaccrual loans increased from $748 to $3,191 in 2016, primarily due to loans acquired in the CBN acquisition. We believe our credit and underwriting policies continue to support more effective lending decisions by the\nBank, which increases the likelihood of maintaining loan quality going forward. Moreover, we believe the favorable trends noted in previous quarters regarding our nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets reflect our continued adherence to improved underwriting criteria and practices along with improvements in macroeconomic factors in our credit markets.\nFor fiscal 2016, net loan charge-offs declined to $503 from $666 one year earlier. The majority of the charge-offs were consumer non-real estate loans as were the majority of the loan recoveries. Due to the improved credit quality of originated loans throughout the year, Management believes lower reserves were needed in 2016. In the third quarter, the Bank completed the acquisition of CBN which resulted in a higher level of non-performing assets. However, the assets were recorded at fair market value which lessened the need for additional reserves on the acquired assets as of September 30, 2016. Certain external factors may result in higher future losses but are not readily determinable at this time, including, but not limited to: unemployment rates, increased taxes and continuing increased regulatory expectations with respect to ALL levels. As a result, our analysis may show a need to increase our ALL as a percentage of total loans and nonperforming loans for the near future. Loans charged-off are subject to periodic review and specific efforts are taken to achieve maximum recovery of principal, accrued interest and related expenses on the loans charged off.\nNonperforming Loans, Potential Problem Loans and Foreclosed Properties. We employ early identification of non-accrual and problem loans in order to minimize the risk of loss. Non-performing loans are defined as either 90 days or more past due or non-accrual. The accrual of interest income is discontinued according to the following schedules:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Commercial/agricultural real estate loans, past due 90 days or more;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Commercial/agricultural non-real estate loans past due 90 days or more;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Closed ended consumer non-real estate loans past due 120 days or more; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Residential real estate loans and open ended consumer non-real estate loans past due 180 days or more.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> When interest accruals are discontinued, interest credited to income is reversed. If collection is in doubt, cash receipts on non-accrual loans are used to reduce principal rather than recorded as interest income. Restructuring a loan typically involves the granting of some concession to the borrower involving a loan modification, such as modifying the payment schedule or making interest rate changes. Restructured loans may involve loans that have had a charge-off taken against the loan to reduce the carrying amount of the loan to fair market value as determined pursuant to ASC 310-10. Restructured loans that comply with the restructured terms are considered performing loans.\nNon-performing loans increased $2,350 during the year ended September 30, 2016 from their balances at 2015 fiscal year end. The increase related mostly to new assets acquired in the CBN transaction which were recorded at fair market value at the time of the acquisition, totaled $1,749. These non-performing loan relationships are secured primarily by collateral including residential real estate or the consumer assets financed by the loans.\nNon-performing assets include non-performing loans, other real estate owned and other collateral owned. Our non-performing assets were $4,348 at September 30, 2016, or 0.62% of total assets. This represented an increase from $2,123, or 0.37% of total assets, at September 30, 2015. The increase since September 30, 2015 was primarily due to an increase in non-performing loans acquired with CBN that were recorded at fair market value at the time of the acquisition.\nOther real estate owned and other collateral owned is comprised of foreclosed collateral assets held by the Bank until sold. Other real estate owned (OREO) decreased by $114 and other collateral owned decreased by $12 during the year ended September 30, 2016 from their balances as of September 30, 2015. We continue to aggressively liquidate our OREO and other collateral owned as part of our overall credit risk strategy.\nInvestment Securities. We manage our securities portfolio in an effort to improve interest rate risk, enhance income, and provide liquidity. Our investment portfolio is comprised of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity.\nSecurities held to maturity (recorded at amortized cost) were $6,669 at September 30, 2016, compared with $8,012 at September 30, 2015. Securities available for sale (recorded at fair value), which represent the majority of our investment portfolio, were $80,123 at September 30, 2016, compared with $79,921 at September 30, 2015.\nThe

However, as of September 30, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding on this Federal Reserve Bank line of credit. As of September 30, 2016, the Bank has pledged certain of its U.S. Government Agency securities with a carrying value of $6,163 and mortgage-backed securities with a carrying value of $20,856 as collateral against specific municipal deposits.\nIntangible Assets. We have other intangibles of $872, comprised of core deposit intangible assets arising from various acquisitions from 2002 through 2016. Amortization expense, calculated on a straight line basis, was $111 and $57 for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Annually, we assess the reasonableness of the remaining useful life assumptions assigned to each core deposit intangible asset. No changes were made during 2016 in the remaining useful lives of our core deposit intangibles, which originally ranged from approximately 7 to 15 years.\nDeposits. Deposits are our largest source of funds. Average total deposits for 2016 were $477,571, an increase of 9.61% from the level of average total deposits for 2015. Total deposits increased to $557,677 at September 30, 2016, from $456,298 at September 30, 2015, due primarily to deposits acquired in the CBN transaction totaling $151,020 and deposits purchased from Central Bank in Rice Lake and Barron, Wisconsin totaling $27,131, partially offset by deposit runoff in the markets where branch closures took place and a reduction in checking balances from Insider accounts related to the CBN acquisition. As of September 30, 2016, the balance in the municipal money market accounts was approximately $32,016 and the balance in municipal certificate of deposit accounts was approximately $16,051.\nOur objective is to grow core deposits and build customer relationships with convenience, customer service, and by expanding our deposit product offerings with competitive pricing. Management expects to continue to place emphasis on both retaining and generating additional core deposits in 2017 through competitive pricing of deposit products and through the branch delivery systems that we have already established, as well as through online and mobile banking options. We anticipate CD and money market deposits from our closed branches to continue running off over time as we have experienced in the past.\nInstitutional certificates of deposit as a funding source decreased $9,277 from their balance as of September 30, 2015. Institutional certificates of deposit remain an important part of our deposit mix, as we continue to pursue funding sources to lower the Bank's cost of funds.\nBrokered deposits were $5,003 and $22,773 at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. Brokered deposit levels are within all regulatory directives thereon.\nFederal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances and other borrowings. FHLB advances were $59,291 and $58,891 at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, as we continue to utilize these advances, as necessary, to supplement core deposits to meet our funding and liquidity needs, and as we evaluate all options to lower the Bank's cost of funds. On May 16, 2016, we entered into a Loan Agreement with First Tennessee Bank National Association (\"FTB\") evidencing an $11,000 term loan maturing on May 15, 2021. The proceeds from the Loan were used by the Company for the sole purpose of financing the acquisition, by merger, of CBN. On September 30, 2016, we amended and restated the loan Agreement with FTB whereby FTB extended a $3,000 revolving line of credit to the Company for the purpose of financing the previously announced stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company may purchase up to 525,200 shares of its common stock, or approximately 10 percent of the outstanding shares from time to time through October 1, 2017. At September 30, 2016, the available and unused portion of this borrowing arrangement was $3,000. The Company has pledged 100% of Bank stock as collateral for the FTB loan and credit facilities.\nStockholders' Equity. Total stockholders' equity was $64,544 at September 30, 2016, versus $61,453 at September 30, 2015. The increase resulted primarily from net income of $2,573 for the year ended September 30, 2016.\nLiquidity and Asset / Liability Management. Liquidity management refers to our ability to ensure cash is available in a timely manner to meet loan demand and depositors' needs, and meet other financial obligations as they become due without undue cost, risk or disruption to normal operating activities. We manage and monitor our short-term and long-term liquidity positions and needs through a regular review of maturity profiles, funding sources, and loan and deposit forecasts to minimize funding risk. A key metric we monitor is our liquidity ratio, calculated as cash and investments with maturities less than one-year divided by deposits with maturities less than or equal to one-year. At September 30, 2016, our liquidity ratio was 6.25 percent, which was below our targeted liquidity ratio of 10 percent. We view this as acceptable given our access to lines of credit totaling $115,500 as explained below.\nOur primary sources of funds are: deposits; amortization, prepayments and maturities of outstanding loans; other short-term investments; and funds provided from operations. We use our sources of funds primarily to meet ongoing commitments, to pay maturing certificates of deposit and savings withdrawals, and to fund loan commitments. While scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and maturing short-term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. Although $141,397 of our $273,948 (51.6%) CD portfolio will mature within the next 12 months, we have historically retained a majority of our maturing CD's. However, due to strategic pricing decisions regarding rate matching and branch closures, our retention rate may decrease in the future. Through new deposit product offerings to our branch and commercial customers, we are currently attempting to strengthen customer relationships to attract additional non-rate sensitive deposits. In our present interest rate environment, and based on maturing yields, this should also improve our cost of funds.\nWe maintain access to additional sources of funds including FHLB borrowings and lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank, US Bank, First Tennessee Bank, NA and Bankers' Bank. We utilize FHLB borrowings to leverage our capital base, to provide funds for our lending and investment activities, and to manage our interest rate risk. Our borrowing arrangement with the FHLB calls for pledging certain qualified real estate loans, and borrowing up to 75% of the value of those loans, not to exceed 35% of the Bank's total assets. Currently, we have approximately $90,500 available under this arrangement. We also maintain lines of credit of $3,500 with the Federal Reserve Bank, $5,000 with US Bank, $3,000 with First Tennessee Bank, NA and $13,500 with Bankers' Bank as part of our contingency funding plan.\nIn reviewing our adequacy of liquidity, we review and evaluate historical financial information, including information regarding general economic conditions, current ratios, management goals and the resources available to meet our anticipated liquidity needs. Management believes that our liquidity is adequate and, to management's knowledge, there are no known events or uncertainties that will result or are likely to reasonably result in a material increase or decrease in our liquidity.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. In the ordinary course of business, the Bank has entered into off-balance sheet financial instruments, issued to meet customer financial needs. Such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when they become payable. These instruments include unused commitments for lines of credit, overdraft protection lines of credit and home equity lines of credit, as well as commitments to extend credit. As of September 30, 2016, the\nCompany had approximately $28,476 in unused commitments, compared to approximately $24,097 in unused commitments as of September 30, 2015. See Note 12 \"Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk\" for further detail.\nCapital Resources. As of September 30, 2016, our Tier 1 and Risk-based capital levels exceeded levels necessary to be considered Well Capitalized\u201d under Prompt Corrective Action provisions for both the Bank and at the Company level.\nBelow are the amounts and ratios for our capital levels as of the dates noted below for the Bank.\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

financial data summarizing the results of operations, as restated, for each quarter in the years\nended September 30, 2015 and 2016. Management determined that certain professional and other expense accrual items were overstated during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 resulting in understatement of the Company's net income for the quarterly and annual periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2015. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, management reversed these overstated accrued expenses which resulted in an overstatement of quarterly and annual net income for the year ended September 30, 2016. The effect of these restatements on the Company's 2015 and 2016 quarterly consolidated statements of operations, as reported on Forms 10-Q, are as follows: total non-interest expense decreased by $60 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015; and decreased by $85 for each of the quarters ended June 30, 2015; March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Net income increased by $36 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015; and increased by $52 for each of the quarters ended June 30, 2015; March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Total non-interest expense increased by $151, $43, and $21 for the quarters ended June 30, 2016; March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Net income decreased by $92, $26, and $13 for the quarters ended June 30, 2016; March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGENERAL\nThe following discussion sets forth management's discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations that should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, related notes, the selected financial data and the statistical information presented elsewhere in this report for a more complete understanding of the following discussion and analysis. Unless otherwise noted, years refer to the Company's fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.\nRESTATEMENT SUMMARY\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, includes restatement of\nour previously filed consolidated financial statements and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 as well as revised quarterly results of operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2016. The prior period errors were discovered in connection with the annual audit of consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Management determined that certain professional and other expense accrual items were overstated during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 resulting in understatement of the Company's net income for the quarterly and annual periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2015. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, management reversed these overstated accrued expenses which resulted in an overstatement of quarterly and annual net income for the year ended September 30, 2016. The cumulative effect of the net over-accruals of certain expenses for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 was that net income was understated by $726 and $192 respectively. The effect of these restatements on the Company's 2016 and 2015 quarterly consolidated statements of operations, as reported on Forms 10-Q, are as follows: Total non-interest expense decreased by $60 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015; and decreased by $85 for each of the quarters ended June 30, 2015; March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Net income increased by $36 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015; and increased by $52 for each of the quarters ended June 30, 2015; March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Total non-interest expense increased by $151, $43, and $21 for the quarters ended June 30, 2016; March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Net income decreased by $92, $26, and $13 for the quarters ended June 30, 2016; March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The effects of the restatements on the Company's balance sheets and statements of cash flows for the Restated Periods were not material. For further detail regarding the restatement of the financial statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2015, see Note 2, Financial Restatements, to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. For the revised quarterly results of operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, see Selected Quarterly Financial Data\u201d under Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nWe believe that presenting all of this information regarding the Restated Periods in this Annual Report allows investors to\nreview all pertinent data in a single presentation. We have not filed amendments to our annual or quarterly reports for the fiscal\nyears ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 or quarterly reports for the quarterly periods ended December 31, 2015, March 31,\n2016 and June 30, 2016 or the preliminary earnings release for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016 furnished on an\nForm 8-K filed on October 28, 2016 (collectively, the Affected Reports\u201d). Accordingly, investors should rely only on the\nfinancial information and other disclosures regarding the Restated Periods in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and not on the\nAffected Reports or any reports, earnings releases or similar communications relating to those periods.\nPERFORMANCE SUMMARY\nThe following is a brief summary of some of the significant factors that affected our operating results in 2016. See the remainder of this section for a more thorough discussion. Unless otherwise stated, all monetary amounts in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, other than share, per share and capital ratio amounts, are stated in thousands.\nWe reported net income of $2,573 for the year ended September 30, 2016, compared to net income of $2,806 for the year ended September 30, 2015. Diluted earnings per share were $0.49 for 2016 compared to $0.54 for the year ended September 30, 2015. Return on average assets for the year ended September 30, 2016 was 0.40%, compared to 0.49% for the year ended September 30, 2015. The return on average equity was 4.08% for 2016 and 4.70% for 2015. An annual cash\ndividend in the amount of $0.12 per share and $0.08 per share was paid in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nKey factors behind the earnings results were:\n \u2022 Net interest income was $20,077 for 2016, an increase of $1,511, or 8.14% from $18,566 for 2015, due to an increase in the level of interest earning assets related to the acquisition of CBN. Interest income increased to $25,084 from $23,004, or 9.04% from 2015 to 2016. Meanwhile, interest expense increased to $5,007 from $4,438, or 12.82% from 2015 to 2016 . \n \u2022 The net interest margin for 2016 was 3.27% compared to 3.36% for 2015. The 9 bp decrease in net interest margin was mainly attributable to an 7 bp decrease in the yield on interest earning assets during 2016. Yield on loans decreased 9 bps while yields on investment securities increased 5 bps year over year, respectively, during these two periods. \n \u2022 Provision for loan losses was reduced to $75 for fiscal 2016, compared to $656 for fiscal 2015, due to improved asset quality of our originated loans. \n \u2022 Non-interest income, was $3,915 for 2016 and $3,913 for 2015. \n \u2022 Non-interest expense was $20,058 for 2016, an increase of $2,655 from an amount of $17,403 in 2015. The increased non-interest expense for 2016 was related to higher compensation and benefit costs, one-time merger related costs and branch closure costs. \n \u2022 We recognized a tax provision of $1,286 and $1,614 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n \u2022 Total loans were $574,439 at September 30, 2016, an increase of $123,929, or 27.51% from their levels at September 30, 2015. Total deposits were $557,677 as of September 30, 2016, compared to $456,298 at September 30, 2015, an increase of $101,379, or 22.22% from their levels at September 30, 2015. The increased loan and deposit balances largely relate to the CBN acquisition. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Accounting Standards Generally Accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") as applied in the United States. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. Some of these estimates are more critical than others. Below is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates\nAllowance for Loan Losses.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable and inherent losses in our loan portfolio. The allowance is based on ongoing, quarterly assessments of the estimated probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio. In evaluating the level of the allowance for loan loss, we consider the types of loans and the amount of loans in our loan portfolio, historical loss experience, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions and other relevant factors determined by management. We follow all applicable regulatory guidance, including the Interagency Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses,\u201d issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). We believe that the Bank's Allowance for Loan Losses Policy conforms to all applicable regulatory requirements. However, based on periodic examinations by regulators, the amount of the allowance for loan losses recorded during a particular period may be adjusted.\nOur determination of the allowance for loan losses is based on (1) specific allowances for specifically identified and evaluated impaired loans and their corresponding estimated loss based on likelihood of default, payment history, and net realizable value of underlying collateral. Specific allocations for collateral dependent loans are based on fair value of the underlying collateral relative to the unpaid principal balance of individually impaired loans. For loans that are not collateral dependent, the specific allocation is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate through the repayment period; and (2) a general allowance on loans not specifically identified in (1) above, based on historical loss ratios, which are adjusted for qualitative and general economic factors. We continue to refine our allowance for loan losses methodology, with an increased emphasis on historical performance adjusted for applicable economic and qualitative factors.\nAssessing the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires making material estimates, including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans, any of which estimates may be susceptible to significant change. In our opinion, the allowance, when taken as a whole, reflects estimated probable loan losses in our loan portfolio.\nGoodwill.\nGoodwill resulting from the acquisition by merger of CBN was determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, over the fair value of the net assets acquired, less liabilities assumed in the acquisition by merger, as of the acquisition date. Goodwill resulting from the selective purchase of loans and deposits from Central Bank in February 2016 was determined as the excess of the Premium Deposit less the Core Deposit Intangible as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is determined to have an indefinite useful life, and is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances exist that indicate that a goodwill impairment test should be performed.\nFair Value Measurements and Valuation Methodologies.\nWe apply various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as most investment securities. However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include loans, deposits, borrowings, goodwill, core deposit intangible assets, other assets and liabilities obtained or assumed in business combinations, and certain other financial instruments. These valuations require the use of various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or disclosures of fair value information.\nIn addition to valuation, the Company must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of assets that should be considered other than temporary or otherwise require an adjustment in carrying value and recognition of a loss in the consolidated statement of income. Examples include but are not limited to; loans, investment securities, goodwill, core deposit intangible assets and deferred tax assets, among others. Specific assumptions, estimates and judgments utilized by management are discussed in detail herein in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 15 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes.\nAmounts provided for income tax expenses are based on income reported for financial statement purposes and do not necessarily represent amounts currently payable under tax laws. Deferred income taxes, which arise principally from temporary differences between the amounts reported in the financial statements and the tax basis of certain assets and liabilities, are included in the amounts provided for income taxes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and tax planning strategies which will create taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and if necessary, tax planning strategies in making this assessment.\nThe assessment of tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates, assumptions, interpretations, and judgments concerning certain accounting pronouncements and application of specific provisions of federal and state tax codes. There can be no assurance that future events, such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing authorities, will not differ from management's current assessment, the impact of which could be material to our consolidated results of our operations and reported earnings. We believe that the deferred tax assets and liabilities are adequate and properly recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2016, management does not believe a valuation allowance related to the realizability of its deferred tax assets is necessary.\nSTATEMENT OF OPERATIONS ANALYSIS\n2016 compared to 2015\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income represents the difference between the dollar amount of interest earned on interest bearing assets and the dollar amount of interest paid on interest bearing liabilities. The interest income and expense of financial institutions are significantly affected by general economic conditions, competition, policies of regulatory authorities and other factors.\nInterest rate spread and net interest margin are used to measure and explain changes in net interest income. Interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the rate paid for interest bearing liabilities that fund\nthose assets. Net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average interest earning assets. Net interest margin exceeds interest rate spread because non-interest bearing sources of funds ( net free funds\u201d), principally demand deposits and stockholders' equity, also support interest earning assets. The narrative below discusses net interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin.\nTax equivalent net interest income was $20,344 for 2016, compared to $18,698 for 2015. Interest income on tax exempt securities is computed on a tax equivalent basis. The net interest margin for 2016 was 3.27% compared to 3.36% for 2015. The 9 bp decrease in net interest margin was mainly attributable to a 9 bp decrease in yield on loans as many loans have repriced or been originated in a lower interest rate environment. Competitive pricing on new and refinanced loans resulted in loan volume at lower rates, as well as increased refinancing of one to four family loans due to the current low rate environment, both contributed to reduced loan yields in 2016. Partially offsetting the decline in loan yields, was a 5 bp increase in the yield on investment securities. The investment securities yield increased through the purchase of higher yielding non-taxable municipal investment grade securities.\nThe cost of deposits increased slightly in 2016 to 0.88% from 0.87% in 2015. The slight increase reflects a larger balance of certificates of deposit acquired in the CBN acquisition.\nCompetitive pricing on new and refinanced loans resulted in loan volume at lower rates, as well as increased refinancing of one to four family loans due to the current low rate environment, both contributed to reduced loan yields in 2016. Certain FHLB advances were purchased, with shorter term maturities and lower interest rates than in the previous fiscal year, offset by longer term, higher rate borrowings used to finance the acquisition of CBN and certain deposits from closed branches were replaced with higher rate interest bearing deposits, causing the increase in rates on our interest-bearing liabilities.\nAs shown in the rate/volume analysis table below, positive volume changes resulted in a $1,987 increase in net interest income in 2016. Average loan volume increases were due to commercial real estate and non-real estate loan growth in the current fiscal year over the prior fiscal year, arising from management's strategy to continue to diversify its credit portfolio. The increase and changes in the composition of interest earning assets resulted in a $2,215 increase in interest income for 2016, and a $569 increase in interest expense due to the composition change in interest bearing liabilities. Rate changes on interest earning assets caused a decrease in interest income by $309 and increased interest expense by $32, for a net impact of a $341 decrease in net interest income between 2016 and 2015.\nAverage Balances, Net Interest Income, Yields Earned and Rates Paid. The following table shows tax equivalent interest income from average interest earning assets, expressed in dollars and yields, and interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities, expressed in dollars and rates. Also presented is the weighted average yield on interest earning assets, rates paid on interest bearing liabilities and the resultant spread at September 30 for each of the last two fiscal years. Non-accruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.\nAverage interest earning assets were $621,571 in 2016 compared to $556,937 in 2015. Average loans outstanding increased to $504,972 in 2016 from $457,707 in 2015. Interest income on loans increased $1,766, of which $2,198 related to the increase in average outstanding balances, offset by a reduction in interest income due to lower yields on such loans in the amount of $432.\nAverage interest bearing liabilities increased $55,528 in 2016 from their 2015 levels. The increase in average interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to deposits acquired in the CBN acquisition and borrowings used to facilitate the purchase. Average interest bearing deposits increased $41,870, or 9.61% to $477,571 in 2016. Interest expense on interest bearing deposits increased $370 during 2016 from the volume and mix changes and increased $22 from the impact of the rate environment, resulting in an aggregate increase of $392 in interest expense on interest bearing deposits.\n\n(1) For the 12 months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the average balance of the tax exempt investment securities, included in investment securities, were $29,232 and $15,019 respectively. The interest income on tax exempt securities is computed on a tax-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 34% for all periods presented.\nRate/Volume Analysis. The following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for the components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that are presented in the preceding table. For each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to: (1) changes in volume, which are changes in the average outstanding balances multiplied by the prior period rate (i.e. holding the initial rate constant); and (2) changes in rate, which are changes in average interest rates multiplied by the prior period volume (i.e. holding the initial balance constant). Changes due to both rate and volume which cannot be segregated have been allocated in proportion to the relationship of the dollar amounts of the change in each. As shown in the rate/volume analysis table below, positive volume changes resulted in a $1,987 increase in net interest income in 2016. Average loan volume increases were due largely to the acquisition of CBN. The increase and changes in the composition of interest earning assets resulted in a $2,215 increase in interest income for 2016, and a $569 increase in interest expense due to the acquisition. Rate changes on interest earning assets caused a decrease in interest income by $309 and increased interest expense by $32, for a net impact of a $341 decrease in net interest income between 2016 and 2015.\n\n (1) the change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated in proportion to the relationship to the dollar amounts of the change in each. \nProvision for Loan Losses. We determine our provision for loan losses ( provision\u201d, or PLL\u201d) based on our desire to provide an adequate allowance for loan losses ( ALL\u201d) to reflect probable and inherent credit losses in our loan portfolio.\nNet loan charge-offs for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $503 and $666, respectively. Net charge-offs to average loans were 0.10% for 2016 compared to 0.14% for 2015. For 2016, non-performing loans increased by $2,350 to $3,571 from $1,221 at September 30, 2015. Refer to the Risk Management and the Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d section below for more information related to non-performing loans.\nWe recorded provisions for loan losses of $75 and $656 for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Management believes that the provision taken for the year ended September 30, 2016 is adequate in view of the present condition of the Bank's loan portfolio and the sufficiency of collateral supporting non-performing loans. We are continually monitoring non-performing loan relationships and will make provisions, as necessary, if the facts and circumstances change. In addition, a decline in the quality of our loan portfolio as a result of general economic conditions, factors affecting particular\nborrowers or our market areas, or other factors could all affect the adequacy of our ALL. If there are significant charge-offs against the ALL, or we otherwise determine that the ALL is inadequate, we will need to record an additional PLL in the future. See Note 1 Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for further analysis of the provision for loan losses.\nNon-Interest Income. The following table reflects the various components of non-interest income for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n\nService charges on deposit accounts decreased $88 during 2016 mainly due to a decrease in electronic banking fee and NSF fee income. Loan fees and service charges increased $5 during 2016 mainly due to commercial loan origination and servicing fees.\nNon-Interest Expense. The following table reflects the various components of non-interest expense for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n\nSalaries and related benefits increased due to the addition of personnel related to the CBN acquisition and severance costs associated with branch closures. Occupancy costs, consisting primarily of office rental and depreciation expenses, decreased during the current twelve month period over the same period in the prior year due in part to branch closures. The current year did not reflect a full year of depreciation related to the acquisition of CBN branch facilities. Data processing expenses increased in 2016 due to increased costs associated with converting the CBN system and expenses related to servicing a larger customer base. The amortization of core deposit expenses increased in 2016 due to the establishment of a core deposit intangible and its related amortization. Advertising, marketing and public relations expenses increased during 2016 over 2015 due to expenses associated with rebranding the CBN facilities and marketing the CBN customers. Professional services expense increased in the\ncurrent year due to increased use of outside professionals in connection to the acquisition, relative", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGENERAL\nThe following discussion sets forth management's discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations that should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, related notes, the selected financial data and the statistical information presented elsewhere in this report for a more complete understanding of the following discussion and analysis. Unless otherwise noted, years refer to the Company's fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.\nRESTATEMENT SUMMARY\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, includes restatement of\nour previously filed consolidated financial statements and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 as well as revised quarterly results of operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2016. The prior period errors were discovered in connection with the annual audit of consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Management determined that certain professional and other expense accrual items were overstated during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 resulting in understatement of the Company's net income for the quarterly and annual periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2015. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, management reversed these overstated accrued expenses which resulted in an overstatement of quarterly and annual net income for the year ended September 30, 2016. The cumulative effect of the net over-accruals of certain expenses for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 was that net income was understated by $726 and $192 respectively. The effect of these restatements on the Company's 2016 and 2015 quarterly consolidated statements of operations, as reported on Forms 10-Q, are as follows: Total non-interest expense decreased by $60 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015; and decreased by $85 for each of the quarters ended June 30, 2015; March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Net income increased by $36 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015; and increased by $52 for each of the quarters ended June 30, 2015; March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Total non-interest expense increased by $151, $43, and $21 for the quarters ended June 30, 2016; March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Net income decreased by $92, $26, and $13 for the quarters ended June 30, 2016; March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The effects of the restatements on the Company's balance sheets and statements of cash flows for the Restated Periods were not material. For further detail regarding the restatement of the financial statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2015, see Note 2, Financial Restatements, to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. For the revised quarterly results of operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, see Selected Quarterly Financial Data\u201d under Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nWe believe that presenting all of this information regarding the Restated Periods in this Annual Report allows investors to\nreview all pertinent data in a single presentation. We have not filed amendments to our annual or quarterly reports for the fiscal\nyears ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 or quarterly reports for the quarterly periods ended December 31, 2015, March 31,\n2016 and June 30, 2016 or the preliminary earnings release for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016 furnished on an\nForm 8-K filed on October 28, 2016 (collectively, the Affected Reports\u201d). Accordingly, investors should rely only on the\nfinancial information and other disclosures regarding the Restated Periods in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and not on the\nAffected Reports or any reports, earnings releases or similar communications relating to those periods.\nPERFORMANCE SUMMARY\nThe following is a brief summary of some of the significant factors that affected our operating results in 2016. See the remainder of this section for a more thorough discussion. Unless otherwise stated, all monetary amounts in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, other than share, per share and capital ratio amounts, are stated in thousands.\nWe reported net income of $2,573 for the year ended September 30, 2016, compared to net income of $2,806 for the year ended September 30, 2015. Diluted earnings per share were $0.49 for 2016 compared to $0.54 for the year ended September 30, 2015. Return on average assets for the year ended September 30, 2016 was 0.40%, compared to 0.49% for the year ended September 30, 2015. The return on average equity was 4.08% for 2016 and 4.70% for 2015. An annual cash\ndividend in the amount of $0.12 per share and $0.08 per share was paid in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nKey factors behind the earnings results were:\n \u2022 Net interest income was $20,077 for 2016, an increase of $1,511, or 8.14% from $18,566 for 2015, due to an increase in the level of interest earning assets related to the acquisition of CBN. Interest income increased to $25,084 from $23,004, or 9.04% from 2015 to 2016. Meanwhile, interest expense increased to $5,007 from $4,438, or 12.82% from 2015 to 2016 . \n \u2022 The net interest margin for 2016 was 3.27% compared to 3.36% for 2015. The 9 bp decrease in net interest margin was mainly attributable to an 7 bp decrease in the yield on interest earning assets during 2016. Yield on loans decreased 9 bps while yields on investment securities increased 5 bps year over year, respectively, during these two periods. \n \u2022 Provision for loan losses was reduced to $75 for fiscal 2016, compared to $656 for fiscal 2015, due to improved asset quality of our originated loans. \n \u2022 Non-interest income, was $3,915 for 2016 and $3,913 for 2015. \n \u2022 Non-interest expense was $20,058 for 2016, an increase of $2,655 from an amount of $17,403 in 2015. The increased non-interest expense for 2016 was related to higher compensation and benefit costs, one-time merger related costs and branch closure costs. \n \u2022 We recognized a tax provision of $1,286 and $1,614 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n \u2022 Total loans were $574,439 at September 30, 2016, an increase of $123,929, or 27.51% from their levels at September 30, 2015. Total deposits were $557,677 as of September 30, 2016, compared to $456,298 at September 30, 2015, an increase of $101,379, or 22.22% from their levels at September 30, 2015. The increased loan and deposit balances largely relate to the CBN acquisition. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Accounting Standards Generally Accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") as applied in the United States. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. Some of these estimates are more critical than others. Below is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates\nAllowance for Loan Losses.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable and inherent losses in our loan portfolio. The allowance is based on ongoing, quarterly assessments of the estimated probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio. In evaluating the level of the allowance for loan loss, we consider the types of loans and the amount of loans in our loan portfolio, historical loss experience, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions and other relevant factors determined by management. We follow all applicable regulatory guidance, including the Interagency Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses,\u201d issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). We believe that the Bank's Allowance for Loan Losses Policy conforms to all applicable regulatory requirements. However, based on periodic examinations by regulators, the amount of the allowance for loan losses recorded during a particular period may be adjusted.\nOur determination of the allowance for loan losses is based on (1) specific allowances for specifically identified and evaluated impaired loans and their corresponding estimated loss based on likelihood of default, payment history, and net realizable value of underlying collateral. Specific allocations for collateral dependent loans are based on fair value of the underlying collateral relative to the unpaid principal balance of individually impaired loans. For loans that are not collateral dependent, the specific allocation is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate through the repayment period; and (2) a general allowance on loans not specifically identified in (1) above, based on historical loss ratios, which are adjusted for qualitative and general economic factors. We continue to refine our allowance for loan losses methodology, with an increased emphasis on historical performance adjusted for applicable economic and qualitative factors.\nAssessing the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires making material estimates, including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans, any of which estimates may be susceptible to significant change. In our opinion, the allowance, when taken as a whole, reflects estimated probable loan losses in our loan portfolio.\nGoodwill.\nGoodwill resulting from the acquisition by merger of CBN was determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, over the fair value of the net assets acquired, less liabilities assumed in the acquisition by merger, as of the acquisition date. Goodwill resulting from the selective purchase of loans and deposits from Central Bank in February 2016 was determined as the excess of the Premium Deposit less the Core Deposit Intangible as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is determined to have an indefinite useful life, and is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances exist that indicate that a goodwill impairment test should be performed.\nFair Value Measurements and Valuation Methodologies.\nWe apply various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as most investment securities. However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include loans, deposits, borrowings, goodwill, core deposit intangible assets, other assets and liabilities obtained or assumed in business combinations, and certain other financial instruments. These valuations require the use of various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or disclosures of fair value information.\nIn addition to valuation, the Company must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of assets that should be considered other than temporary or otherwise require an adjustment in carrying value and recognition of a loss in the consolidated statement of income. Examples include but are not limited to; loans, investment securities, goodwill, core deposit intangible assets and deferred tax assets, among others. Specific assumptions, estimates and judgments utilized by management are discussed in detail herein in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 15 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes.\nAmounts provided for income tax expenses are based on income reported for financial statement purposes and do not necessarily represent amounts currently payable under tax laws. Deferred income taxes, which arise principally from temporary differences between the amounts reported in the financial statements and the tax basis of certain assets and liabilities, are included in the amounts provided for income taxes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and tax planning strategies which will create taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and if necessary, tax planning strategies in making this assessment.\nThe assessment of tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates, assumptions, interpretations, and judgments concerning certain accounting pronouncements and application of specific provisions of federal and state tax codes. There can be no assurance that future events, such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing authorities, will not differ from management's current assessment, the impact of which could be material to our consolidated results of our operations and reported earnings. We believe that the deferred tax assets and liabilities are adequate and properly recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2016, management does not believe a valuation allowance related to the realizability of its deferred tax assets is necessary.\nSTATEMENT OF OPERATIONS ANALYSIS\n2016 compared to 2015\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income represents the difference between the dollar amount of interest earned on interest bearing assets and the dollar amount of interest paid on interest bearing liabilities. The interest income and expense of financial institutions are significantly affected by general economic conditions, competition, policies of regulatory authorities and other factors.\nInterest rate spread and net interest margin are used to measure and explain changes in net interest income. Interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the rate paid for interest bearing liabilities that fund\nthose assets. Net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average interest earning assets. Net interest margin exceeds interest rate spread because non-interest bearing sources of funds ( net free funds\u201d), principally demand deposits and stockholders' equity, also support interest earning assets. The narrative below discusses net interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin.\nTax equivalent net interest income was $20,344 for 2016, compared to $18,698 for 2015. Interest income on tax exempt securities is computed on a tax equivalent basis. The net interest margin for 2016 was 3.27% compared to 3.36% for 2015. The 9 bp decrease in net interest margin was mainly attributable to a 9 bp decrease in yield on loans as many loans have repriced or been originated in a lower interest rate environment. Competitive pricing on new and refinanced loans resulted in loan volume at lower rates, as well as increased refinancing of one to four family loans due to the current low rate environment, both contributed to reduced loan yields in 2016. Partially offsetting the decline in loan yields, was a 5 bp increase in the yield on investment securities. The investment securities yield increased through the purchase of higher yielding non-taxable municipal investment grade securities.\nThe cost of deposits increased slightly in 2016 to 0.88% from 0.87% in 2015. The slight increase reflects a larger balance of certificates of deposit acquired in the CBN acquisition.\nCompetitive pricing on new and refinanced loans resulted in loan volume at lower rates, as well as increased refinancing of one to four family loans due to the current low rate environment, both contributed to reduced loan yields in 2016. Certain FHLB advances were purchased, with shorter term maturities and lower interest rates than in the previous fiscal year, offset by longer term, higher rate borrowings used to finance the acquisition of CBN and certain deposits from closed branches were replaced with higher rate interest bearing deposits, causing the increase in rates on our interest-bearing liabilities.\nAs shown in the rate/volume analysis table below, positive volume changes resulted in a $1,987 increase in net interest income in 2016. Average loan volume increases were due to commercial real estate and non-real estate loan growth in the current fiscal year over the prior fiscal year, arising from management's strategy to continue to diversify its credit portfolio. The increase and changes in the composition of interest earning assets resulted in a $2,215 increase in interest income for 2016, and a $569 increase in interest expense due to the composition change in interest bearing liabilities. Rate changes on interest earning assets caused a decrease in interest income by $309 and increased interest expense by $32, for a net impact of a $341 decrease in net interest income between 2016 and 2015.\nAverage Balances, Net Interest Income, Yields Earned and Rates Paid. The following table shows tax equivalent interest income from average interest earning assets, expressed in dollars and yields, and interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities, expressed in dollars and rates. Also presented is the weighted average yield on interest earning assets, rates paid on interest bearing liabilities and the resultant spread at September 30 for each of the last two fiscal years. Non-accruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.\nAverage interest earning assets were $621,571 in 2016 compared to $556,937 in 2015. Average loans outstanding increased to $504,972 in 2016 from $457,707 in 2015. Interest income on loans increased $1,766, of which $2,198 related to the increase in average outstanding balances, offset by a reduction in interest income due to lower yields on such loans in the amount of $432.\nAverage interest bearing liabilities increased $55,528 in 2016 from their 2015 levels. The increase in average interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to deposits acquired in the CBN acquisition and borrowings used to facilitate the purchase. Average interest bearing deposits increased $41,870, or 9.61% to $477,571 in 2016. Interest expense on interest bearing deposits increased $370 during 2016 from the volume and mix changes and increased $22 from the impact of the rate environment, resulting in an aggregate increase of $392 in interest expense on interest bearing deposits.\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

and 2015, the average balance of the tax exempt investment securities, included in investment securities, were $29,232 and $15,019 respectively. The interest income on tax exempt securities is computed on a tax-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 34% for all periods presented.\nRate/Volume Analysis. The following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for the components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that are presented in the preceding table. For each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to: (1) changes in volume, which are changes in the average outstanding balances multiplied by the prior period rate (i.e. holding the initial rate constant); and (2) changes in rate, which are changes in average interest rates multiplied by the prior period volume (i.e. holding the initial balance constant). Changes due to both rate and volume which cannot be segregated have been allocated in proportion to the relationship of the dollar amounts of the change in each. As shown in the rate/volume analysis table below, positive volume changes resulted in a $1,987 increase in net interest income in 2016. Average loan volume increases were due largely to the acquisition of CBN. The increase and changes in the composition of interest earning assets resulted in a $2,215 increase in interest income for 2016, and a $569 increase in interest expense due to the acquisition. Rate changes on interest earning assets caused a decrease in interest income by $309 and increased interest expense by $32, for a net impact of a $341 decrease in net interest income between 2016 and 2015.\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended September 30,\n2016 v. 2015\nIncrease (decrease) due to\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Volume (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\nIncrease /\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(432\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest bearing deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>348\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-marketable equity securities, at cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest earning assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(309\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Demand deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Money market accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CD's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IRA's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB Advances and other borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest bearing liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>569\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(341\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) the change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated in proportion to the relationship to the dollar amounts of the change in each. \nProvision for Loan Losses. We determine our provision for loan losses ( provision\u201d, or PLL\u201d) based on our desire to provide an adequate allowance for loan losses ( ALL\u201d) to reflect probable and inherent credit losses in our loan portfolio.\nNet loan charge-offs for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $503 and $666, respectively. Net charge-offs to average loans were 0.10% for 2016 compared to 0.14% for 2015. For 2016, non-performing loans increased by $2,350 to $3,571 from $1,221 at September 30, 2015. Refer to the Risk Management and the Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d section below for more information related to non-performing loans.\nWe recorded provisions for loan losses of $75 and $656 for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Management believes that the provision taken for the year ended September 30, 2016 is adequate in view of the present condition of the Bank's loan portfolio and the sufficiency of collateral supporting non-performing loans. We are continually monitoring non-performing loan relationships and will make provisions, as necessary, if the facts and circumstances change. In addition, a decline in the quality of our loan portfolio as a result of general economic conditions, factors affecting particular\nborrowers or our market areas, or other factors could all affect the adequacy of our ALL. If there are significant charge-offs against the ALL, or we otherwise determine that the ALL is inadequate, we will need to record an additional PLL in the future. See Note 1 Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for further analysis of the provision for loan losses.\nNon-Interest Income.

Occupancy costs, consisting primarily of office rental and depreciation expenses, decreased during the current twelve month period over the same period in the prior year due in part to branch closures. The current year did not reflect a full year of depreciation related to the acquisition of CBN branch facilities. Data processing expenses increased in 2016 due to increased costs associated with converting the CBN system and expenses related to servicing a larger customer base. The amortization of core deposit expenses increased in 2016 due to the establishment of a core deposit intangible and its related amortization. Advertising, marketing and public relations expenses increased during 2016 over 2015 due to expenses associated with rebranding the CBN facilities and marketing the CBN customers.
