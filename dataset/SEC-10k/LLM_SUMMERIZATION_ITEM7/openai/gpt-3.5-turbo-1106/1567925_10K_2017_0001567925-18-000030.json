Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly under Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe were formed on January 11, 2013 under the laws of Maryland to acquire and operate a diversified portfolio of income-producing commercial real estate with a focus on data centers and healthcare properties, preferably with long-term net leases to creditworthy tenants, as well as to make real estate-related investments that relate to such property types.\nWe commenced our initial public offering of $2,350,000,000 of shares of our common stock, or our Initial Offering, consisting of $2,250,000,000 of shares in our primary offering and up to $100,000,000 of shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or DRIP, on May 29, 2014. We ceased offering shares of common stock pursuant to our Initial Offering on November 24, 2017. At the completion of our Initial Offering, we had accepted investors subscriptions for and issued approximately 125,095,000 shares of Class A, Class I and Class T common stock, including shares of common stock issued pursuant to our DRIP resulting in gross proceeds of $1,223,803,000, before selling commissions and dealer manager fees of approximately $91,503,000.\nOn November 27, 2017, our follow-on offering, or our Offering, of up to $1,000,000,000 in shares of Class A common stock, Class I common stock, and Class T common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11, or the Follow-On Registration Statement, was declared effective by the SEC.\nOn September 28, 2017, our board of directors, at the recommendation of the audit committee, which is comprised solely of independent directors, unanimously approved and established an Estimated Per Share NAV of $9.18 as of June 30, 2017 of each of our Class A common stock, Class I common stock and Class T common stock for purposes of assisting broker-dealers participating in the Initial Offering and the Offering in meeting their customer account statement reporting obligations under National Association of Securities Dealers Conduct Rule 2340. As a result of our board of directors' determination of the Estimated Per Share NAV, our board of directors approved the revised primary offering prices of $10.200 per Class A share, $9.273 per Class I share, and $9.766 per Class T share, effective October 1, 2017. Further, our board of directors approved $9.18 as the per share purchase price of Class A shares, Class I shares and Class T shares pursuant to the DRIP, effective October 1, 2017. The Estimated Per Share NAV is not subject to audit by our independent registered public accounting firm. We intend to publish an updated estimated NAV per share on at least an annual basis.\nOn October 13, 2017, we registered 10,893,246 shares of common stock under the DRIP pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3, or the DRIP Registration Statement, for a price per share of $9.18 per Class A share, Class I share and Class T share for a proposed maximum offering price of $100,000,000 in shares of common stock, or the DRIP Offering. The DRIP Registration Statement was automatically effective with the SEC upon filing and we commenced offering shares of common stock pursuant to the DRIP Registration Statement on December 1, 2017. On December 6, 2017, we filed a post-effective amendment to our DRIP Registration Statement to register shares of Class T2 common stock at $9.18 per share.\nOn June 2, 2017, we filed Articles Supplementary to the Second Articles of Amendment and Restatement with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland reclassifying a portion of our Class A common stock, Class I common stock and Class T common stock as Class T2 common stock. On December 6, 2017, we filed Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to our Registration Statement on Form S-11 to register Class T2 shares of common stock, which was declared effective by the SEC on February 20, 2018.\nWe ceased offering shares of Class T common stock in our Offering on March 14, 2018. As of March 15, 2018, we are offering, in any combination with a dollar value up to the maximum offering amount, shares of Class A common stock at a price of $10.200 per share, shares of Class I common stock at a price of $9.273 per share, and shares of Class T2 common stock at a price of $9.714 per share. The offering prices are based on the most recent estimated per share net asset value, or Estimated Per Share NAV, of $9.18 of each of our Class A common stock, Class I common stock and Class T common stock, and any\napplicable per share upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees. We refer to the \"Offering\", \"Initial Offering\" and \"DRIP Offering\" collectively as the \"Offerings\".\nSubstantially all of our operations are conducted through our Operating Partnership. We are externally advised by our Advisor, which is our affiliate, pursuant to an advisory agreement between us and our Advisor. Our Advisor supervises and manages our day-to-day operations and selects the properties and real estate-related investments we acquire, subject to the oversight and approval of our board of directors. Our Advisor also provides marketing, sales and client services related to real estate on our behalf. Our Advisor engages affiliated entities to provide various services to us. Our Advisor is managed by, and is a subsidiary of, our sponsor, Carter Validus REIT Management Company II, LLC, or our Sponsor. We have no paid employees and we rely on our Advisor to provide substantially all of our services.\nCarter Validus Real Estate Management Services II, LLC, or our Property Manager, a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Sponsor, serves as our property manager. Our Advisor and our Property Manager received, and will continue to receive, fees during the acquisition and operational stages and our Advisor may be eligible to receive fees during the liquidation stage of the Company. SC Distributors, LLC, an affiliate of the Advisor, or the Dealer Manager, serves as the dealer manager of the Initial Offering. The Dealer Manager has received, and will continue to receive, fees for services related to our Initial Offering and Offering.\nWe currently operate through two reportable segments - commercial real estate investments in data centers and healthcare. As of December 31, 2017, we had purchased 53 real estate investments, consisting of 70 properties, comprising approximately 5,190,000 of gross rental square feet for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1,611,055,000.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur critical accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2-\"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" or Note 2, of the consolidated financial statements that are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses the most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nInvestment in Real Estate\nReal estate costs related to the acquisition, development, construction and improvement of properties are capitalized. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized. Repair and maintenance costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of the real estate asset. We consider the period of future benefit of an asset in determining the appropriate useful life. Real estate assets, other than land, are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over each asset's useful life. We anticipate the estimated useful lives of our assets by class as follows:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Buildings and improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15 - 40 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Shorter of lease term or expected useful life\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Furniture, fixtures, and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 10 years\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of the assets by estimating whether we will recover the carrying value of such assets through their undiscounted future cash flows and eventual disposition. If, based on this analysis, we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of the asset, we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. No impairment indicators have been identified and no impairment losses were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWhen developing estimates of expected future cash flows, we make certain assumptions regarding future market rental income amounts subsequent to the expiration of current lease arrangements, property operating expenses, terminal capitalization and discount rates, the number of months it takes to re-lease the property, required tenant improvements and the number of years the property will be held for investment. The use of alternative assumptions in the future cash flow analysis could result in a different determination of the property's future cash flows and a different conclusion regarding the existence of an impairment, the extent of such loss, if any, as well as the carrying value of the real estate and related assets.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nUpon the acquisition of real properties, we evaluate whether the acquisition is a business combination or an asset acquisition. For both business combinations and asset acquisitions we allocate the purchase price of properties to acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, buildings and improvements, and acquired intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases. For asset acquisitions, we capitalize transaction costs and allocate the purchase price using a relative fair value method allocating all accumulated costs. For business combinations, we expense transaction costs associated as incurred and allocates the purchase price based on the estimated fair value of each separately identifiable asset and liability.\nThe fair values of the tangible assets of an acquired property (which includes land, buildings and improvements) are determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the as-if-vacant\u201d value is then allocated to land and buildings and improvements based on our determination of the relative fair value of these assets. Management determines the as-if-vacant fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers. Factors considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases, including leasing commissions and other related costs. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance, and other operating expenses during the expected lease-up periods based on current market conditions.\nThe fair values of above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) an estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease including any fixed rate bargain renewal periods, with respect to a below-market lease. The above-market and below-market lease values are capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities. Above-market lease values are amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Below-market leases are amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases, including any fixed rate bargain renewal periods. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of above-market and below-market in-place lease values related to that lease would be recorded as an adjustment to rental income.\nThe fair values of in-place leases include an estimate of direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant and opportunity costs associated with lost rentals that are avoided by acquiring an in-place lease. Direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant include commissions, tenant improvements, and other direct costs and are estimated based on management's consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease. The value of opportunity costs is calculated using the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases over a market absorption period for a similar lease. The in-place lease intangibles are amortized to expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of in-place lease assets relating to that lease would be expensed.\nRevenue Recognition, Tenant Receivables and Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 605, Revenue Recognition, or ASC 605. ASC 605 requires that all four of the following basic criteria be met before revenue is realized or realizable and earned: (1) there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the seller's price to the buyer is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.\nIn accordance with ASC 840, Leases, minimum rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease (including rent holidays). Differences between rental income recognized and amounts contractually due under the lease agreements are credited or charged to deferred rent receivable or deferred rent liability, as applicable. Tenant reimbursement revenue, which is comprised of additional amounts recoverable from tenants for common area maintenance expenses and certain other recoverable expenses, is recognized as revenue in the period in which the related expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with ASC Subtopic 605-45, Revenue Recognition-Principal Agent Consideration, or ASC 605-45. ASC 605-45 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis when we are the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, and thus, we have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk.\nTenant receivables and unbilled deferred rent receivables are carried net of the allowances for uncollectible current tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rent. An allowance will be maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain tenants to meet the contractual obligations under their lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for deferred rent receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents. Our determination of the adequacy of these allowances is based primarily upon evaluations of historical loss experience, the tenant's financial condition, security deposits, letters of credit, lease guarantees and current economic conditions and other relevant factors. No allowances for uncollectible tenant receivables were recorded as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nWe elected to be taxed, and currently qualify, as a REIT for federal income tax purposes under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2014. As a REIT, we are required, among other things, to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding capital gains) to our stockholders. In addition, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent we distribute our taxable income to our stockholders. REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements. Even if we maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we, or our subsidiaries, may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property, and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.\nReal Estate Investments in 2017 and Subsequent\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During the year ended December 31, 2017, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired 16 real estate investments, consisting of 19 properties, for an aggregate purchase price of $610,923,000 and comprising approximately 2,149,000 gross rental square feet of commercial space.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Subsequent to December 31, 2017 and through March 16, 2018, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired two real estate properties for an aggregate purchase price of $50,960,000 and comprising approximately 133,000 gross rental square feet of commercial space.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> For a further discussion of our 2017 acquisitions, see Note 3-\"Real Estate Investments\" and for a further discussion on acquisitions in 2018, see Note 21-\"Subsequent Events\" to the consolidated financial statements that are a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFactors that May Influence Results of Operations\nWe are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally and those risks listed in Part I. Item 1A. \"Risk Factors,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income from the acquisition, management and operation of our properties.\nRental Income\nThe amount of rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of leased space and to lease available space at the then-existing rental rates. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental income in future periods. As of December 31, 2017, our properties were 97.7% leased.\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations are influenced by the timing of acquisitions and the operating performance of our real estate properties.

We generate almost all of our net operating income from property operations. In order to evaluate our overall portfolio, management analyzes the net operating income of same store properties. We define \"same store properties\" as operating properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of both calendar periods being compared and exclude properties under development.\nBy evaluating the property net operating income of our same store properties, management is able to monitor the operations of our existing properties for comparable periods to measure the performance of our current portfolio and determine the effects of our new acquisitions on net income (loss).\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nChanges in our revenues are

Other offering costs associated with the Initial Offering (other than selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and servicing fees) were approximately 2.0% of the gross offering proceeds. We expect that other offering costs associated with the Offering (other than selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and servicing fees) will be approximately 1.5% of the gross offering proceeds. Since inception, our Advisor and its affiliates incurred other organization and offering costs on our behalf of approximately $17,669,000 as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we reimbursed our Advisor or its affiliates approximately $17,049,000 in other offering costs. In addition, we paid our Advisor or its affiliates $453,000 in other offering costs related to subscription agreements. As of December 31, 2017, we accrued approximately $167,000 of other offering costs to our Advisor and its affiliates. As of December 31, 2017, we incurred approximately $91,898,000 in selling commissions and dealer manager fees and $15,830,000 in distribution and servicing fees to our Dealer Manager. As of December 31, 2017, we incurred other offering costs (other than selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and servicing fees) of approximately $23,357,000.\nWhen incurred, organization costs are expensed and offering costs, including selling commissions, dealer manager fees, distribution and servicing fees and other offering costs are charged to stockholders' equity. For a further discussion of other organization and offering costs, see Note 10-\"Related-Party Transactions and Arrangements\" to the consolidated financial statements that are a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDistributions to Stockholders\nWe have paid, and may continue to pay, distributions from sources other than from our cash flows from operations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our cash flows provided by operations of approximately $51.8 million was a shortfall of approximately $9.5 million, or 15.5%, of our distributions (total distributions were approximately $61.3 million, of which $29.0 million was cash and $32.3 million was reinvested in shares of our common stock pursuant to our DRIP) during such period and such shortfall was paid from proceeds from our DRIP Offering. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our cash flows provided by operations of approximately $25.0 million was a shortfall of approximately $15.6 million, or 38.4%, of our distributions (total distributions were approximately $40.6 million, of which $17.7 million was cash and $22.9 million was reinvested in shares of our common stock pursuant to our DRIP) during such period and such shortfall was paid from proceeds from our Initial Offering. Until we acquire additional properties or other real estate-related investments, we may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to pay distributions. Our inability to acquire additional properties or other real estate-related investments may result in a lower return on investment than a stockholder may expect.\nWe do not have any limits on the sources of funding distribution payments to our stockholders. We may pay distributions from any source, such as from borrowings, the sale of assets, the sale of additional securities, advances from our advisor, our\nadvisor's deferral, suspension and/or waiver of its fees and expense reimbursements and offering proceeds and have no limits on the amounts we may pay from such sources. Funding distributions from borrowings could restrict the amount we can borrow for investments, which may affect our profitability. Funding distributions with the sale of assets may affect our ability to generate cash flows. Funding distributions from the sale of additional securities could dilute a stockholder's interest in us if we sell shares of our common stock to third party investors. Funding distributions from the proceeds of our Offering will result in us having less funds available for acquiring properties or real estate-related investments. Our inability to acquire additional properties or real estate-related investments may have a negative effect on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to pay distributions. As a result, the return investors may realize on their investment may be reduced and investors who invest in us before we generate significant cash flow may realize a lower rate of return than later investors. Payment of distributions from any of the mentioned sources could restrict our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, affect our profitability and/or affect the distributions payable upon a liquidity event, any or all of which may have an adverse effect on an investment in us.\nFor federal income tax purposes, distributions to common stockholders are characterized as ordinary dividends, capital gain distributions, or nontaxable distributions. To the extent that we make a distribution in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, the distribution will be a nontaxable return of capital, reducing the tax basis in each U.S. stockholder's shares. Further, the amount of distributions in excess of a U.S. stockholder's tax basis in such shares will be taxable as a gain realized from the sale of those shares.\nThe following table shows the character of distributions we paid on a percentage basis during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Character of Class A Distributions:\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ordinary dividends\n</td> <td>36.49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nontaxable distributions\n</td> <td>63.51\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.77\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Character of Class I Distributions:\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ordinary dividends\n</td> <td>36.49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nontaxable distributions\n</td> <td>63.51\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Character of Class T Distributions:\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ordinary dividends\n</td> <td>25.93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.07\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nontaxable distributions\n</td> <td>74.07\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nShare Repurchase Program\nWe have approved a share repurchase program that allows for repurchases of shares of our common stock when certain criteria are met. The share repurchase program provides that all repurchases during any calendar year, including those redeemable upon death or a Qualifying Disability of a stockholder, are limited to 5% of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding on December 31st of the previous calendar year and to those that can be funded with reinvestments pursuant to our DRIP Offering during the prior calendar year and other operating funds, if any, as the board of directors, in its sole discretion, may reserve for this purpose.\nRepurchases of shares of the Company's common stock are at the sole discretion of our board of directors. In addition, our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may amend, suspend, reduce, terminate or otherwise change the share repurchase program upon 30 days' prior notice to our stockholders for any reason it deems appropriate. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we received valid repurchase requests related to approximately 1,880,820 Class A shares, Class T shares and Class I shares of common stock (1,793,424 Class A shares, 81,939 Class T shares and 5,457 Class I shares), all of which were repurchased in full for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $17,159,000 (an average of $9.12 per share).\nInflation\nWe are exposed to inflation risk as income from long-term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations. There are provisions in certain of our leases with tenants that are intended to protect us from, and mitigate the risk of, the impact of inflation. These provisions include scheduled increases in contractual base rent receipts, reimbursement billings for operating expenses, pass-through charges and real estate tax and insurance reimbursements. However, due to the long-term nature of our leases, among other factors, the leases may not reset frequently enough to adequately offset the effects of inflation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal demands for funds are for acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related investments, to pay operating expenses and interest on our current and future indebtedness and to pay distributions to our stockholders. Our sources of funds are primarily the net proceeds of our Offering, funds equal to amounts reinvested in the DRIP, operating cash flows, the secured credit facility and other borrowings. In addition, we require resources to make certain payments to our Advisor and our Dealer Manager, which, during our Offering, include payments to our Advisor and its affiliates for reimbursement of other organization and offering expenses and other costs incurred on our behalf, and payments to our Dealer Manager and its affiliates for selling commissions, dealer manager fees, distribution and servicing fees, and offering expenses.\nGenerally, cash needs for items other than acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related investments are met from operations, borrowings, and the net proceeds of our Offering. However, there may be a delay between the sale of shares of our common stock and our investments in real estate, which could result in a delay in the benefits to our stockholders, if any, of returns generated from our investment operations.\nOur Advisor evaluates potential additional investments and engages in negotiations with real estate sellers, developers, brokers, investment managers, lenders and others on our behalf. Until we invest all of the proceeds of our Offering in properties and real estate-related investments, we may invest in short-term, highly liquid or other authorized investments. Such short-term investments will not earn significant returns, and we cannot predict how long it will take to fully invest the proceeds in properties and real estate-related investments. The number of properties we acquire and other investments we make will depend upon the number of shares sold in our Offering and the resulting amount of net proceeds available for investment.\nWhen we acquire a property, our Advisor prepares a capital plan that contemplates the estimated capital needs of that investment. In addition to operating expenses, capital needs may also include costs of refurbishment, tenant improvements or other major capital expenditures. The capital plan also sets forth the anticipated sources of the necessary capital, which may include a line of credit or other loans established with respect to the investment, operating cash generated by the investment, additional equity investments from us or joint venture partners or, when necessary, capital reserves. Any capital reserves would be established from the net proceeds of our Offering, proceeds from sales of other investments, operating cash generated by other investments or other cash on hand. In some cases, a lender may require us to establish capital reserves for a particular investment. The capital plan for each investment will be adjusted through ongoing, regular reviews of our portfolio or as necessary to respond to unanticipated additional capital needs.\nShort-term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOn a short-term basis, our principal demands for funds will be for the acquisition of real estate and real estate-related notes and investments and payments of tenant improvements, acquisition related costs, operating expenses, distributions to and repurchases from stockholders, and interest and principal payments on current and future debt financings. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through net cash flows provided by operations, net proceeds from our Offering, borrowings on the secured credit facility, as well as secured and unsecured borrowings from banks and other lenders to finance our expected future acquisitions.\nLong-term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOn a long-term basis, our principal demands for funds will be for the acquisition of real estate and real estate-related notes and investments and payments of tenant improvements, acquisition related costs, operating expenses, distributions to and repurchases from stockholders, and interest and principal payments on current and future indebtedness. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through proceeds from cash flow from operations, borrowings on the secured credit facility, proceeds from secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from our Offering and funds equal to amounts reinvested in the DRIP.\nWe expect that substantially all cash flows from operations will be used to pay distributions to our stockholders after certain capital expenditures; however, we have used, and may continue to use other sources to fund distributions, as necessary, such as, proceeds from our Offering, borrowings on the secured credit facility and/or future borrowings on unencumbered assets. To the extent cash flows from operations are lower due to fewer properties being acquired or lower-than-expected\nreturns on the properties held, distributions paid to stockholders may be lower. We expect that substantially all net cash flows from our Offering or debt financings will be used to fund acquisitions, certain capital expenditures identified at acquisition, repayments of outstanding debt or distributions to our stockholders in excess of cash flows from operations.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe will require approximately $21.6 million in expenditures for capital improvements over the next 12 months. We cannot provide assurances, however, that actual expenditures will not exceed these estimated expenditure levels. As of December 31, 2017, we had $9.1 million of restricted cash in escrow reserve accounts for such capital expenditures. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $74.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had capital expenditures of $32.5 million that primarily related to two healthcare real estate investments.\nCredit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2017, the maximum commitments available under the secured credit facility were $425,000,000, consisting of a $325,000,000 revolving line of credit, with a maturity date of December 22, 2018, subject to our Operating Partnership's right to two, 12-month extension periods, and a $100,000,000 term loan, with a maturity date of December 22, 2019, subject to our Operating Partnership's right to one, 12-month extension period.\nThe proceeds of loans made under the secured credit facility may be used to finance the acquisition of real estate investments, for tenant improvements and leasing commissions with respect to real estate, for repayment of indebtedness, for capital expenditures with respect to real estate and for general corporate and working capital purposes. The secured credit facility can be increased to $550,000,000, subject to certain conditions. See Note 9-\"Credit Facility\" to the consolidated financial statements that are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe annual interest rate payable under the secured credit facility is, at our Operating Partnership's option, either: (a) the London Interbank Offered Rate, or the LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.00% to 2.65%, which is determined based on the overall leverage of our Operating Partnership or (b) a base rate which means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the prime rate for such day plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.65% which is determined based on the overall leverage of our Operating Partnership. In addition to interest, our Operating Partnership is required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the lenders' commitments under the secured credit facility at a per annum rate equal to 0.30% if the average daily amount outstanding under the secured credit facility is less than 50% of the lenders' commitments or 0.20% if the average daily amount outstanding under the secured credit facility is greater than 50% of the lenders' commitments, and the unused fee is payable quarterly in arrears. As of December 31, 2017, the weighted average interest rate was 3.71%.\nThe actual amount of credit available under the secured credit facility is a function of certain loan-to-cost, loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios contained in the secured credit facility agreement. The amount of credit available under the secured credit facility will be a maximum principal amount of the value of the assets that are included in the pool availability. The obligations of our Operating Partnership with respect to the secured credit facility agreement are guaranteed by us, including but not limited to, the payment of any outstanding indebtedness under the secured credit facility agreement, and all terms, conditions and covenants of the secured credit facility agreement.\nThe secured credit facility agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for credit facilities and transactions of this type, including limitations on the incurrence of debt by our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries that own properties that serve as collateral for our secured credit facility, limitations on the nature of our Operating Partnership's business, and limitations on distributions by us, our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. The secured credit facility agreement imposes the following financial covenants, which are specifically defined in the secured credit facility agreement, on our Operating Partnership: (a) maximum ratio of indebtedness to gross asset value; (b) minimum ratio of adjusted consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to consolidated fixed charges; (c) minimum tangible net worth; (d) minimum liquidity thresholds; (e) minimum quarterly equity raise; (f) minimum weighted average remaining lease term of properties in the collateral pool; and (g) minimum number of properties in the collateral pool. In addition, the secured credit facility agreement includes events of default that are customary for credit facilities and transactions of this type. We were in compliance with all financial covenant requirements at December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had a total pool availability under the secured credit facility of $397,842,000 and an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $220,000,000. As of December 31, 2017, $177,842,000 remained available to be drawn on the secured credit facility.\nFinancing\nWe anticipate that our aggregate borrowings, both secured and unsecured, will not exceed the greater of 50.0% of the combined cost or fair market value of our real estate and real estate-related investments following completion of our Offering. For these purposes, the fair market value of each asset is equal to the purchase price paid for the asset or, if the asset was\nappraised subsequent to the date of purchase, then the fair market value will be equal to the value reported in the most recent independent appraisal of the asset. Our policies do not limit the amount we may borrow with respect to any individual investment. As of December 31, 2017, our borrowings were 39.4% of the fair market value of our real estate investments.\nUnder our charter, we have a limitation on borrowing that precludes us from borrowing in excess of 300.0% of our net assets, without the approval of a majority of our independent directors. Net assets for purposes of this calculation are defined to be our total assets (other than intangibles) valued at cost prior to deducting depreciation, amortization, bad debt and other non-cash reserves, less total liabilities. Generally, the preceding calculation is expected to approximate 75.0% of the aggregate cost of our real estate and real estate-related investments before depreciation, amortization, bad debt and other similar non-cash reserves. In addition, we may incur mortgage debt and pledge some or all of our properties as security for that debt to obtain funds to acquire additional real properties or for working capital. We may also borrow funds to satisfy the REIT tax qualification requirement that we distribute at least 90.0% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders. Furthermore, we may borrow if we otherwise deem it necessary or advisable to ensure that we maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2017, our leverage did not exceed 300.0% of the value of our net assets.\nNotes Payable\nFor a discussion of our notes payable, see Note 8-\"Notes Payable\" to the consolidated

directors and is dependent on a number of factors, including our funds available for distribution, financial condition, capital expenditure requirements and the annual distribution requirements needed to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code. Our board of directors must authorize each distribution and may, in the future, authorize lower amounts of distributions or not authorize additional distributions and, therefore, distribution payments are not guaranteed. Our Advisor may also defer, suspend and/or waive fees and expense reimbursements if we have not generated sufficient cash flow from our operations and other sources to fund distributions. Additionally, our organizational documents permit us to pay distributions from unlimited amounts of any source, and we may use sources other than operating cash flows to fund distributions, including proceeds from our Offerings, which may reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in properties or other permitted investments.\nWe have funded distributions with operating cash flows from our properties, proceeds raised in our Offerings. To the extent that we do not have taxable income, distributions paid will be considered a return of capital to stockholders.

These distributions were paid on January 2, 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we declared and paid distributions of approximately $61.3 million to Class A stockholders, Class I stockholders and Class T stockholders, including shares issued pursuant to the DRIP, as compared to FFO (as defined below) for the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $62.4 million, which covered 100% of our distributions paid during such period. The payment of distributions from sources other than FFO may reduce the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations or cause us to incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds.\nFor a discussion of distributions paid subsequent to December 31, 2017, see Note 21-\"Subsequent Events\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nFor a discussion of our commitments and contingencies, see Note 18-\"Commitments and Contingencies\" to the consolidated financial statements that are a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDebt Service Requirements\nOne of our principal liquidity needs is the payment of principal and interest on outstanding indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, we had $468.1 million in notes payable outstanding principal and $220.0 million outstanding principal under the secured credit facility. We are required by the terms of certain loan documents to meet certain covenants, such as financial ratios and reporting requirements. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all such covenants and requirements on our mortgage loans payable and the secured credit facility.\nIn addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we entered into eight derivative instruments for the purpose of managing or hedging our interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2017, the aggregate notional amount under our derivative instruments was $347.7 million. We have agreements with each derivative counterparty that contain cross-default provisions, whereby if we default on certain of our unsecured indebtedness, then we could also be declared in default on our derivative obligations, resulting in an acceleration of payment thereunder. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all such cross-default provisions.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $688.1 million of principal debt outstanding, of which $468.1 million related to notes payable and $220.0 million related to the secured credit facility. See Note 8-\"Notes Payable\" and Note 9-\"Credit Facility\" to the consolidated financial statements that are a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for certain terms of the debt outstanding.\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 were as follows (amounts in thousands):\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments-fixed rate debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments-fixed rate debt\n</td> <td>9,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments-variable rate debt fixed through interest rate swap (1)\n</td> <td>314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>242,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>347,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments-variable rate debt fixed through interest rate swap (2)\n</td> <td>15,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments-variable rate debt\n</td> <td>120,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments-variable rate debt (3)\n</td> <td>4,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>21,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ground lease payments\n</td> <td>545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>352,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>845,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2017, we had $347.7 million outstanding principal on notes payable and borrowings under the secured credit facility that were fixed through the use of interest rate swap agreements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>We used the fixed rates under our interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2017 to calculate the debt payment obligations in future periods.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>We used LIBOR plus the applicable margin under our variable rate debt agreement as of December 31, 2017 to calculate the debt payment obligations in future periods.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Arrangements\nWe have entered into agreements with our Advisor and its affiliates whereby we agree to pay certain fees to, or reimburse certain expenses of, our Advisor or its affiliates for acquisition fees and expenses, organization and offering expenses, asset and property management fees and reimbursement of operating costs. Refer to Note 10-\"Related-Party Transactions and Arrangements\" to our consolidated financial statements that are a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of the various related-party transactions and agreements.\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nOne of our objectives is to provide cash distributions to our stockholders from cash generated by our operations. The purchase of real estate assets and real estate-related investments, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key operational feature of our business plan in order to generate cash from operations. Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations, or FFO, which we believe is an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. FFO is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP.\nWe define FFO, consistent with NAREIT's definition, as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property and asset impairment write-downs, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.\nWe, along with others in the real estate industry, consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a REIT's operating performance because it is based on a net income (loss) analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization and asset impairment write-downs, which we believe provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to our management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy.\nHistorical accounting convention (in accordance with GAAP) for real estate assets requires companies to report their investment in real estate at its carrying value, which consists of capitalizing the cost of acquisitions, development, construction, improvements and significant replacements, less depreciation and amortization and asset impairment write-downs, if any, which is not necessarily equivalent to the fair market value of their investment in real estate assets.\nThe historical accounting convention requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, which could be the case if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances and/or as requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed. We believe that, since the fair value of real estate assets historically rises and falls with market conditions including, but not limited to, inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative.\nIn addition, we believe it is appropriate to disregard asset impairment write-downs as they are a non-cash adjustment to recognize losses on prospective sales of real estate assets. Since losses from sales of real estate assets are excluded from FFO, we believe it is appropriate that asset impairment write-downs in advancement of realization of losses should be excluded. Impairment write-downs are based on negative market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, which are independent of our operating performance, including, but not limited to, a significant adverse change in the financial condition of our tenants, changes in supply and demand for similar or competing properties, changes in tax, real estate, environmental and zoning law, which can change over time. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate and related assets may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability by estimating whether we will recover the carrying value of the asset through undiscounted future cash flows and eventual disposition (including, but not limited to, net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of property and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP). If based on this analysis, we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of the real estate asset, we will record an impairment write-down to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the real estate asset. Testing for indicators of impairment is a continuous process and is analyzed on a quarterly basis. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and that we intend to have a relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through the eventual sale of the property. No impairment losses have been recorded to date.\nIn developing estimates of expected future cash flow, we make certain assumptions regarding future market rental income amounts subsequent to the expiration of current lease arrangements, property operating expenses, terminal capitalization and discount rates, the expected number of months it takes to re-lease the property, required tenant improvements and the number of years the property will be held for investment. The use of alternative assumptions in the future cash flow analysis could result in a different determination of the property's future cash flows and a different conclusion regarding the existence of an asset impairment, the extent of such loss, if any, as well as the carrying value of the real estate asset.\nPublicly registered, non-listed REITs, such as us, typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operations. While other start up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that publicly registered, non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases. We will use the proceeds raised in our offering to acquire real estate assets and real estate-related investments, and we intend to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event (i.e., listing of our shares of common stock on a national securities exchange, a merger or sale, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or another similar transaction) within five to seven years after the completion of our offering stage, which is generally comparable to other publicly registered, non-listed REITs. Thus, we do not intend to continuously purchase real estate assets and intend to have a limited life. Due to these factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITS, the Investment Program Association, or the IPA, an industry trade group, has standardized a measure known as modified funds from operations, or MFFO, which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REIT. MFFO is a metric used by management to evaluate sustainable performance and dividend policy. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP.\nWe define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA's definition: FFO further adjusted for the following items included in the determination of GAAP net income (loss); acquisition fees and expenses; amounts related to straight-line rental income and amortization of above and below market intangible lease assets and liabilities; accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (loss); nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, adjustments related to contingent purchase price obligations where such adjustments have been included in the derivation of GAAP net income (loss), and after adjustments for a consolidated and unconsolidated partnership and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. Our MFFO calculation complies with the IPA's Practice Guideline, described above. In calculating MFFO, we exclude paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses that are reported in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), amortization of above and below-market leases, amounts related to straight-line rents (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to closer to an expected to be received cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payment) and ineffectiveness of interest rate swaps. The other adjustments included in the IPA's guidelines are not applicable to us.\nSince MFFO excludes acquisition fees and expenses, it should not be construed as a historic performance measure. Acquisition fees and expenses are paid in cash by us, and we have not set aside or put into escrow any specific amount of proceeds from our offerings to be used to fund acquisition fees and expenses. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our Advisor or its affiliates and third parties. Such fees and expenses will not be reimbursed by our Advisor or its affiliates and third parties, and therefore if there are no further proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock to fund future acquisition fees and expenses, such fees and expenses will need to be paid from either additional debt, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or from ancillary cash flows. As a result, the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations would be reduced, or we may incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds. Nevertheless, our Advisor or its affiliates will not accrue any claim on our assets if acquisition fees and expenses are not paid from the proceeds of our offerings. Under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses related to the acquisition of properties determined to be business combinations are expensed as incurred, including investment transactions that are no longer under consideration, and are included in acquisition related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and acquisition fees and expenses associated with transactions determined to be an asset acquisition are capitalized.\nAll paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the real estate asset, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property. In addition, MFFO may not be an indicator of our operating performance, especially during periods in which properties are being acquired.\nIn addition, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income (loss) in determining cash flows from operations in accordance with GAAP.\nWe use MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate our performance against other publicly registered, non-listed REITs, which intend to have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter. As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance if we do not continue to operate in this manner. We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to publicly registered, non-listed REITs, such as their limited life, limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy, and\nhence the use of such measures may be useful to investors. For example, acquisition fees and expenses are intended to be funded from the proceeds of our offering and other financing sources and not from operations. By excluding acquisition fees and expenses, the use of MFFO provides information consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of its real estate assets. Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such charges that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information.\nPresentation of this information is intended to assist management and investors in comparing the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO and MFFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of our performance, as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other measurements as an indication of our performance. MFFO has limitations as a performance measure. However, it may be useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value is disclosed. MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating net asset value since impairment write-downs are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining MFFO.\nFFO and MFFO, as described above, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss) or in its applicability in evaluating our operational performance. The method used to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operating performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO. MFFO has not been scrutinized to the level of other similar non-GAAP performance measures by the SEC or any other regulatory body.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to FFO and MFFO for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (amounts in thousands, except share data and per share amounts):\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,767\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>41,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition related expenses (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets and liabilities (2)\n</td> <td>(1,817\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(500\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Straight-line rents (3)\n</td> <td>(10,596\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,263\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,449\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ineffectiveness of interest rate swaps\n</td> <td>(58\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(144\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MFFO attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic\n</td> <td>101,714,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,991,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,658,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted\n</td> <td>101,731,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,007,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,658,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted for FFO\n</td> <td>101,731,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,007,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,669,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) per common share - basic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) per common share - diluted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO per common share - basic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO per common share - diluted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>In evaluating investments in real estate assets, management differentiates the costs to acquire the investment from the operations derived from the investment.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly under Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe were formed on January 11, 2013 under the laws of Maryland to acquire and operate a diversified portfolio of income-producing commercial real estate with a focus on data centers and healthcare properties, preferably with long-term net leases to creditworthy tenants, as well as to make real estate-related investments that relate to such property types.\nWe commenced our initial public offering of $2,350,000,000 of shares of our common stock, or our Initial Offering, consisting of $2,250,000,000 of shares in our primary offering and up to $100,000,000 of shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or DRIP, on May 29, 2014. We ceased offering shares of common stock pursuant to our Initial Offering on November 24, 2017. At the completion of our Initial Offering, we had accepted investors subscriptions for and issued approximately 125,095,000 shares of Class A, Class I and Class T common stock, including shares of common stock issued pursuant to our DRIP resulting in gross proceeds of $1,223,803,000, before selling commissions and dealer manager fees of approximately $91,503,000.\nOn November 27, 2017, our follow-on offering, or our Offering, of up to $1,000,000,000 in shares of Class A common stock, Class I common stock, and Class T common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11, or the Follow-On Registration Statement, was declared effective by the SEC.\nOn September 28, 2017, our board of directors, at the recommendation of the audit committee, which is comprised solely of independent directors, unanimously approved and established an Estimated Per Share NAV of $9.18 as of June 30, 2017 of each of our Class A common stock, Class I common stock and Class T common stock for purposes of assisting broker-dealers participating in the Initial Offering and the Offering in meeting their customer account statement reporting obligations under National Association of Securities Dealers Conduct Rule 2340. As a result of our board of directors' determination of the Estimated Per Share NAV, our board of directors approved the revised primary offering prices of $10.200 per Class A share, $9.273 per Class I share, and $9.766 per Class T share, effective October 1, 2017. Further, our board of directors approved $9.18 as the per share purchase price of Class A shares, Class I shares and Class T shares pursuant to the DRIP, effective October 1, 2017. The Estimated Per Share NAV is not subject to audit by our independent registered public accounting firm. We intend to publish an updated estimated NAV per share on at least an annual basis.\nOn October 13, 2017, we registered 10,893,246 shares of common stock under the DRIP pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3, or the DRIP Registration Statement, for a price per share of $9.18 per Class A share, Class I share and Class T share for a proposed maximum offering price of $100,000,000 in shares of common stock, or the DRIP Offering. The DRIP Registration Statement was automatically effective with the SEC upon filing and we commenced offering shares of common stock pursuant to the DRIP Registration Statement on December 1, 2017. On December 6, 2017, we filed a post-effective amendment to our DRIP Registration Statement to register shares of Class T2 common stock at $9.18 per share.\nOn June 2, 2017, we filed Articles Supplementary to the Second Articles of Amendment and Restatement with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland reclassifying a portion of our Class A common stock, Class I common stock and Class T common stock as Class T2 common stock. On December 6, 2017, we filed Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to our Registration Statement on Form S-11 to register Class T2 shares of common stock, which was declared effective by the SEC on February 20, 2018.\nWe ceased offering shares of Class T common stock in our Offering on March 14, 2018. As of March 15, 2018, we are offering, in any combination with a dollar value up to the maximum offering amount, shares of Class A common stock at a price of $10.200 per share, shares of Class I common stock at a price of $9.273 per share, and shares of Class T2 common stock at a price of $9.714 per share. The offering prices are based on the most recent estimated per share net asset value, or Estimated Per Share NAV, of $9.18 of each of our Class A common stock, Class I common stock and Class T common stock, and any\napplicable per share upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees. We refer to the \"Offering\", \"Initial Offering\" and \"DRIP Offering\" collectively as the \"Offerings\".\nSubstantially all of our operations are conducted through our Operating Partnership. We are externally advised by our Advisor, which is our affiliate, pursuant to an advisory agreement between us and our Advisor. Our Advisor supervises and manages our day-to-day operations and selects the properties and real estate-related investments we acquire, subject to the oversight and approval of our board of directors. Our Advisor also provides marketing, sales and client services related to real estate on our behalf. Our Advisor engages affiliated entities to provide various services to us. Our Advisor is managed by, and is a subsidiary of, our sponsor, Carter Validus REIT Management Company II, LLC, or our Sponsor. We have no paid employees and we rely on our Advisor to provide substantially all of our services.\nCarter Validus Real Estate Management Services II, LLC, or our Property Manager, a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Sponsor, serves as our property manager. Our Advisor and our Property Manager received, and will continue to receive, fees during the acquisition and operational stages and our Advisor may be eligible to receive fees during the liquidation stage of the Company. SC Distributors, LLC, an affiliate of the Advisor, or the Dealer Manager, serves as the dealer manager of the Initial Offering. The Dealer Manager has received, and will continue to receive, fees for services related to our Initial Offering and Offering.\nWe currently operate through two reportable segments - commercial real estate investments in data centers and healthcare. As of December 31, 2017, we had purchased 53 real estate investments, consisting of 70 properties, comprising approximately 5,190,000 of gross rental square feet for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1,611,055,000.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur critical accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2-\"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" or Note 2, of the consolidated financial statements that are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses the most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nInvestment in Real Estate\nReal estate costs related to the acquisition, development, construction and improvement of properties are capitalized. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized. Repair and maintenance costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of the real estate asset. We consider the period of future benefit of an asset in determining the appropriate useful life. Real estate assets, other than land, are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over each asset's useful life. We anticipate the estimated useful lives of our assets by class as follows:\n\nWe continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of the assets by estimating whether we will recover the carrying value of such assets through their undiscounted future cash flows and eventual disposition. If, based on this analysis, we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of the asset, we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. No impairment indicators have been identified and no impairment losses were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWhen developing estimates of expected future cash flows, we make certain assumptions regarding future market rental income amounts subsequent to the expiration of current lease arrangements, property operating expenses, terminal capitalization and discount rates, the number of months it takes to re-lease the property, required tenant improvements and the number of years the property will be held for investment. The use of alternative assumptions in the future cash flow analysis could result in a different determination of the property's future cash flows and a different conclusion regarding the existence of an impairment, the extent of such loss, if any, as well as the carrying value of the real estate and related assets.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nUpon the acquisition of real properties, we evaluate whether the acquisition is a business combination or an asset acquisition. For both business combinations and asset acquisitions we allocate the purchase price of properties to acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, buildings and improvements, and acquired intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases. For asset acquisitions, we capitalize transaction costs and allocate the purchase price using a relative fair value method allocating all accumulated costs. For business combinations, we expense transaction costs associated as incurred and allocates the purchase price based on the estimated fair value of each separately identifiable asset and liability.\nThe fair values of the tangible assets of an acquired property (which includes land, buildings and improvements) are determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the as-if-vacant\u201d value is then allocated to land and buildings and improvements based on our determination of the relative fair value of these assets. Management determines the as-if-vacant fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers. Factors considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases, including leasing commissions and other related costs. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance, and other operating expenses during the expected lease-up periods based on current market conditions.\nThe fair values of above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) an estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease including any fixed rate bargain renewal periods, with respect to a below-market lease. The above-market and below-market lease values are capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities. Above-market lease values are amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Below-market leases are amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases, including any fixed rate bargain renewal periods. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of above-market and below-market in-place lease values related to that lease would be recorded as an adjustment to rental income.\nThe fair values of in-place leases include an estimate of direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant and opportunity costs associated with lost rentals that are avoided by acquiring an in-place lease. Direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant include commissions, tenant improvements, and other direct costs and are estimated based on management's consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease. The value of opportunity costs is calculated using the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases over a market absorption period for a similar lease. The in-place lease intangibles are amortized to expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of in-place lease assets relating to that lease would be expensed.\nRevenue Recognition, Tenant Receivables and Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 605, Revenue Recognition, or ASC 605. ASC 605 requires that all four of the following basic criteria be met before revenue is realized or realizable and earned: (1) there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the seller's price to the buyer is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.\nIn accordance with ASC 840, Leases, minimum rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease (including rent holidays). Differences between rental income recognized and amounts contractually due under the lease agreements are credited or charged to deferred rent receivable or deferred rent liability, as applicable. Tenant reimbursement revenue, which is comprised of additional amounts recoverable from tenants for common area maintenance expenses and certain other recoverable expenses, is recognized as revenue in the period in which the related expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with ASC Subtopic 605-45, Revenue Recognition-Principal Agent Consideration, or ASC 605-45. ASC 605-45 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis when we are the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, and thus, we have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk.\nTenant receivables and unbilled deferred rent receivables are carried net of the allowances for uncollectible current tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rent. An allowance will be maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain tenants to meet the contractual obligations under their lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for deferred rent receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents. Our determination of the adequacy of these allowances is based primarily upon evaluations of historical loss experience, the tenant's financial condition, security deposits, letters of credit, lease guarantees and current economic conditions and other relevant factors. No allowances for uncollectible tenant receivables were recorded as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nWe elected to be taxed, and currently qualify, as a REIT for federal income tax purposes under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2014. As a REIT, we are required, among other things, to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding capital gains) to our stockholders. In addition, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent we distribute our taxable income to our stockholders. REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements. Even if we maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we, or our subsidiaries, may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property, and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.\nReal Estate Investments in 2017 and Subsequent\n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2017, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired 16 real estate investments, consisting of 19 properties, for an aggregate purchase price of $610,923,000 and comprising approximately 2,149,000 gross rental square feet of commercial space. \n \u2022 Subsequent to December 31, 2017 and through March 16, 2018, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired two real estate properties for an aggregate purchase price of $50,960,000 and comprising approximately 133,000 gross rental square feet of commercial space.  For a further discussion of our 2017 acquisitions, see Note 3-\"Real Estate Investments\" and for a further discussion on acquisitions in 2018, see Note 21-\"Subsequent Events\" to the consolidated financial statements that are a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFactors that May Influence Results of Operations\nWe are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally and those risks listed in Part I. Item 1A. \"Risk Factors,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income from the acquisition, management and operation of our properties.\nRental Income\nThe amount of rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of leased space and to lease available space at the then-existing rental rates. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental income in future periods. As of December 31, 2017, our properties were 97.7% leased.\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations are influenced by the timing of acquisitions and the operating performance of our real estate properties. The following table shows the property statistics of our real estate properties as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\n (1) As of December 31, 2017, we owned 70 real estate properties, one of which was under construction. As of December 31, 2016, we owned 51 real estate properties, two of which were under construction. \nThe following table summarizes our real estate activity for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\n (1) During the year ended December 31, 2016, we acquired 23 real estate properties, two of which were under construction. The properties under construction were purchased for $13,601,000.  The following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nThis section describes and compares our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. We generate almost all of our net operating income from property operations. In order to evaluate our overall portfolio, management analyzes the net operating income of same store properties. We define \"same store properties\" as operating properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of both calendar periods being compared and exclude properties under development.\nBy evaluating the property net operating income of our same store properties, management is able to monitor the operations of our existing properties for comparable periods to measure the performance of our current portfolio and determine the effects of our new acquisitions on net income (loss).\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nChanges in our revenues are summarized in the following table (amounts in thousands):\n\n \u2022 There was an increase in contractual rental revenue resulting from average annual rent escalations of 2.10% at our same store properties, which was offset entirely by straight-line rental revenue. \n \u2022 Non-same store rental and parking revenue, and tenant reimbursement revenue increased due to the acquisition of 40 operating properties and placing in service one development property since January 1, 2016. \n \u2022 Same store tenant reimbursement revenue increased primarily due to an increase in real estate tax and common area maintenance reimbursements at certain same store properties. \n \u2022 Other operating income increased primarily due to miscellaneous fee income earned at one property. \nChanges in our expenses are summarized in the following table (amounts in thousands):\n\n \u2022 Same store rental and parking expenses, certain of which are subject to reimbursement by our tenants, increased primarily due to an increase in real estate taxes and other operating expenses at certain same store properties. \n \u2022 Non-same store rental and parking expenses, certain of which are subject to reimbursement by our tenants, increased primarily due to the acquisition of 40 operating properties and placing in service one development property since January 1, 2016. \n \u2022 General and administrative expenses increased due to an increase in professional fees, personnel and reporting costs in connection with our Company's growth. \n \u2022 Acquisition related expenses decreased due to a decrease in real estate properties determined to be business combinations due to the adoption of ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations. Acquisition fees and expenses associated with transactions determined to be business combinations are expensed as incurred. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not acquire any real estate properties determined to be business combinations as compared to 12 real estate properties determined to be business combinations for an aggregate purchase price of $207.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 Asset management fees increased due to an increase in the weighted average of our investments. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization increased due to an increase in the weighted average depreciable basis of operating real estate investments.  Changes in interest expense, net are summarized in the following table (amounts in thousands):\n\n \u2022 Interest on notes payable increased due to an increase in the outstanding principal balance on notes payable to $468.1 million as of December 31, 2017, as compared to $153.0 million as of December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 Interest on secured credit facility increased due to an increase in the weighted average outstanding principal balance on the secured credit facility, coupled with an increase in interest rates. \n \u2022 Capitalized interest increased due to an increase in the average accumulated expenditures on development properties to $39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $11.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.  Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nChanges in our revenues are summarized in the following table (amounts in thousands):\n\n \u2022 In addition, there was an increase in contractual rental revenue resulting from average annual rent escalations of 1.97% at our same store properties, which was offset by straight-line rental revenue. \n \u2022 Non-same store rental and parking revenue, and tenant reimbursement revenue increased $30.7 million due to the acquisition of 43 operating properties since January 1, 2015.  Changes in our expenses are summarized in the following table (amounts in thousands):\n\n \u2022 Non-same store rental and parking expenses, certain of which are subject to reimbursement by our tenants, increased primarily due to the acquisition of 43 operating properties since January 1, 2015. \n \u2022 General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to an increase in professional and legal fees, an increase in personnel costs and an increase in other administrative costs, in connection with our Company's growth. \n \u2022 Acquisition related expenses decreased due to a decrease in real estate properties determined to be business combinations due to the adoption of ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations. Acquisition fees and expenses associated with transactions determined to be business combinations are expensed as incurred. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we acquired 12 real estate properties determined to be business combinations for an aggregate purchase price of $207.4 million as compared to 21 real estate properties determined to be business combinations for an aggregate purchase price of $366.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 Asset management fees increased due to an increase in the weighted average of our investments. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization increased due to an increase in the weighted average depreciable basis of operating real estate investments. \nChanges in interest expense, net are summarized in the following table (amounts in thousands):\n ", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions.

We ceased offering shares of common stock pursuant to our Initial Offering on November 24, 2017. At the completion of our Initial Offering, we had accepted investors subscriptions for and issued approximately 125,095,000 shares of Class A, Class I and Class T common stock, including shares of common stock issued pursuant to our DRIP resulting in gross proceeds of $1,223,803,000, before selling commissions and dealer manager fees of approximately $91,503,000.\nOn November 27, 2017, our follow-on offering, or our Offering, of up to $1,000,000,000 in shares of Class A common stock, Class I common stock, and Class T common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11, or the Follow-On Registration Statement, was declared effective by the SEC.\nOn September 28, 2017, our board of directors, at the recommendation of the audit committee, which is comprised solely of independent directors, unanimously approved and established an Estimated Per Share NAV of $9.18 as of June 30, 2017 of each of our Class A common stock, Class I common stock and Class T common stock for purposes of assisting broker-dealers participating in the Initial Offering and the Offering in meeting their customer account statement reporting obligations under National Association of Securities Dealers Conduct Rule 2340. As a result of our board of directors' determination of the Estimated Per Share NAV, our board of directors approved the revised primary offering prices of $10.200 per Class A share, $9.273 per Class I share, and $9.766 per Class T share, effective October 1, 2017. Further, our board of directors approved $9.18 as the per share purchase price of Class A shares, Class I shares and Class T shares pursuant to the DRIP, effective October 1, 2017. The Estimated Per Share NAV is not subject to audit by our independent registered public accounting firm. We intend to publish an updated estimated NAV per share on at least an annual basis.\nOn October 13, 2017, we registered 10,893,246 shares of common stock under the DRIP pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3, or the DRIP Registration Statement, for a price per share of $9.18 per Class A share, Class I share and Class T share for a proposed maximum offering price of $100,000,000 in shares of common stock, or the DRIP Offering. The DRIP Registration Statement was automatically effective with the SEC upon filing and we commenced offering shares of common stock pursuant to the DRIP Registration Statement on December 1, 2017. On December 6, 2017, we filed a post-effective amendment to our DRIP Registration Statement to register shares of Class T2 common stock at $9.18 per share.\nOn June 2, 2017, we filed Articles Supplementary to the Second Articles of Amendment and Restatement with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland reclassifying a portion of our Class A common stock, Class I common stock and Class T common stock as Class T2 common stock. On December 6, 2017, we filed Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to our Registration Statement on Form S-11 to register Class T2 shares of common stock, which was declared effective by the SEC on February 20, 2018.\nWe ceased offering shares of Class T common stock in our Offering on March 14, 2018. As of March 15, 2018, we are offering, in any combination with a dollar value up to the maximum offering amount, shares of Class A common stock at a price of $10.200 per share, shares of Class I common stock at a price of $9.273 per share, and shares of Class T2 common stock at a price of $9.714 per share. The offering prices are based on the most recent estimated per share net asset value, or Estimated Per Share NAV, of $9.18 of each of our Class A common stock, Class I common stock and Class T common stock, and any\napplicable per share upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees. We refer to the \"Offering\", \"Initial Offering\" and \"DRIP Offering\" collectively as the \"Offerings\".\nSubstantially all of our operations are conducted through our Operating Partnership. We are externally advised by our Advisor, which is our affiliate, pursuant to an advisory agreement between us and our Advisor. Our Advisor supervises and manages our day-to-day operations and selects the properties and real estate-related investments we acquire, subject to the oversight and approval of our board of directors. Our Advisor also provides marketing, sales and client services related to real estate on our behalf. Our Advisor engages affiliated entities to provide various services to us. Our Advisor is managed by, and is a subsidiary of, our sponsor, Carter Validus REIT Management Company II, LLC, or our Sponsor. We have no paid employees and we rely on our Advisor to provide substantially all of our services.\nCarter Validus Real Estate Management Services II, LLC, or our Property Manager, a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Sponsor, serves as our property manager. Our Advisor and our Property Manager received, and will continue to receive, fees during the acquisition and operational stages and our Advisor may be eligible to receive fees during the liquidation stage of the Company. SC Distributors, LLC, an affiliate of the Advisor, or the Dealer Manager, serves as the dealer manager of the Initial Offering. The Dealer Manager has received, and will continue to receive, fees for services related to our Initial Offering and Offering.\nWe currently operate through two reportable segments - commercial real estate investments in data centers and healthcare. As of December 31, 2017, we had purchased 53 real estate investments, consisting of 70 properties, comprising approximately 5,190,000 of gross rental square feet for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1,611,055,000.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur critical accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2-\"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" or Note 2, of the consolidated financial statements that are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses the most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nInvestment in Real Estate\nReal estate costs related to the acquisition, development, construction and improvement of properties are capitalized. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized. Repair and maintenance costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of the real estate asset. We consider the period of future benefit of an asset in determining the appropriate useful life. Real estate assets, other than land, are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over each asset's useful life. We anticipate the estimated useful lives of our assets by class as follows:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Buildings and improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15 - 40 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Shorter of lease term or expected useful life\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Furniture, fixtures, and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 10 years\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of the assets by estimating whether we will recover the carrying value of such assets through their undiscounted future cash flows and eventual disposition. If, based on this analysis, we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of the asset, we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. No impairment indicators have been identified and no impairment losses were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWhen developing estimates of expected future cash flows, we make certain assumptions regarding future market rental income amounts subsequent to the expiration of current lease arrangements, property operating expenses, terminal capitalization and discount rates, the number of months it takes to re-lease the property, required tenant improvements and the number of years the property will be held for investment. The use of alternative assumptions in the future cash flow analysis could result in a different determination of the property's future cash flows and a different conclusion regarding the existence of an impairment, the extent of such loss, if any, as well as the carrying value of the real estate and related assets.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nUpon the acquisition of real properties, we evaluate whether the acquisition is a business combination or an asset acquisition. For both business combinations and asset acquisitions we allocate the purchase price of properties to acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, buildings and improvements, and acquired intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases. For asset acquisitions, we capitalize transaction costs and allocate the purchase price using a relative fair value method allocating all accumulated costs. For business combinations, we expense transaction costs associated as incurred and allocates the purchase price based on the estimated fair value of each separately identifiable asset and liability.\nThe fair values of the tangible assets of an acquired property (which includes land, buildings and improvements) are determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the as-if-vacant\u201d value is then allocated to land and buildings and improvements based on our determination of the relative fair value of these assets. Management determines the as-if-vacant fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers. Factors considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases, including leasing commissions and other related costs. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance, and other operating expenses during the expected lease-up periods based on current market conditions.\nThe fair values of above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) an estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease including any fixed rate bargain renewal periods, with respect to a below-market lease. The above-market and below-market lease values are capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities. Above-market lease values are amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Below-market leases are amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases, including any fixed rate bargain renewal periods. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of above-market and below-market in-place lease values related to that lease would be recorded as an adjustment to rental income.\nThe fair values of in-place leases include an estimate of direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant and opportunity costs associated with lost rentals that are avoided by acquiring an in-place lease. Direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant include commissions, tenant improvements, and other direct costs and are estimated based on management's consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease. The value of opportunity costs is calculated using the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases over a market absorption period for a similar lease. The in-place lease intangibles are amortized to expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of in-place lease assets relating to that lease would be expensed.\nRevenue Recognition, Tenant Receivables and Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 605, Revenue Recognition, or ASC 605. ASC 605 requires that all four of the following basic criteria be met before revenue is realized or realizable and earned: (1) there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the seller's price to the buyer is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.\nIn accordance with ASC 840, Leases, minimum rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease (including rent holidays). Differences between rental income recognized and amounts contractually due under the lease agreements are credited or charged to deferred rent receivable or deferred rent liability, as applicable. Tenant reimbursement revenue, which is comprised of additional amounts recoverable from tenants for common area maintenance expenses and certain other recoverable expenses, is recognized as revenue in the period in which the related expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with ASC Subtopic 605-45, Revenue Recognition-Principal Agent Consideration, or ASC 605-45. ASC 605-45 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis when we are the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, and thus, we have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk.\nTenant receivables and unbilled deferred rent receivables are carried net of the allowances for uncollectible current tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rent. An allowance will be maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain tenants to meet the contractual obligations under their lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for deferred rent receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents. Our determination of the adequacy of these allowances is based primarily upon evaluations of historical loss experience, the tenant's financial condition, security deposits, letters of credit, lease guarantees and current economic conditions and other relevant factors. No allowances for uncollectible tenant receivables were recorded as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nWe elected to be taxed, and currently qualify, as a REIT for federal income tax purposes under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2014. As a REIT, we are required, among other things, to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding capital gains) to our stockholders. In addition, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent we distribute our taxable income to our stockholders. REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements. Even if we maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we, or our subsidiaries, may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property, and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.\nReal Estate Investments in 2017 and Subsequent\n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2017, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired 16 real estate investments, consisting of 19 properties, for an aggregate purchase price of $610,923,000 and comprising approximately 2,149,000 gross rental square feet of commercial space. \n \u2022 Subsequent to December 31, 2017 and through March 16, 2018, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired two real estate properties for an aggregate purchase price of $50,960,000 and comprising approximately 133,000 gross rental square feet of commercial space.  For a further discussion of our 2017 acquisitions, see Note 3-\"Real Estate Investments\" and for a further discussion on acquisitions in 2018, see Note 21-\"Subsequent Events\" to the consolidated financial statements that are a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFactors that May Influence Results of Operations\nWe are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally and those risks listed in Part I. Item 1A. \"Risk Factors,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income from the acquisition, management and operation of our properties.\nRental Income\nThe amount of rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of leased space and to lease available space at the then-existing rental rates. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental income in future periods. As of December 31, 2017, our properties were 97.7% leased.\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations are influenced by the timing of acquisitions and the operating performance of our real estate properties. The following table shows the property statistics of our real estate properties as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of commercial operating real estate properties(1)\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leased rentable square feet\n</td> <td>5,072,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,972,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,519,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average percentage of rentable square feet leased\n</td> <td>97.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) As of December 31, 2017, we owned 70 real estate properties, one of which was under construction.

The properties under construction were purchased for $13,601,000.  The following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nThis section describes and compares our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. We generate almost all of our net operating income from property operations. In order to evaluate our overall portfolio, management analyzes the net operating income of same store properties. We define \"same store properties\" as operating properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of both calendar periods being compared and exclude properties under development.\nBy evaluating the property net operating income of our same store properties, management is able to monitor the operations of our existing properties for comparable periods to measure the performance of our current portfolio and determine the effects of our new acquisitions on net income (loss).\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nChanges in our revenues are summarized in the following table (amounts in thousands):\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

by straight-line rental revenue. \n \u2022 Non-same store rental and parking revenue, and tenant reimbursement revenue increased due to the acquisition of 40 operating properties and placing in service one development property since January 1, 2016. \n \u2022 Same store tenant reimbursement revenue increased primarily due to an increase in real estate tax and common area maintenance reimbursements at certain same store properties. \n \u2022 Other operating income increased primarily due to miscellaneous fee income earned at one property. \nChanges in our expenses are summarized
