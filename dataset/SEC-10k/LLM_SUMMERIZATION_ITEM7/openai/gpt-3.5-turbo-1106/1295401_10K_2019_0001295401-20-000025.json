Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\ufeff\nThe following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in Item 8 of this report.\nOverview\nIn 2019, we recorded net income of $51.3 million and income before tax of $72.5 million in continuing operations compared to $87.5 million and $119.8 million, respectively, in 2018. The decrease in income before tax of $47.3 million reflected a $65.0 million gain on sale of the Safe Harbor Individual Retirement Account (SHIRA) portfolio in 2018. The decrease also reflected civil money penalties of $7.5 million to the FDIC and $1.4 million to the SEC in 2019. After adjusting for the civil money penalties and gain on sale, income before tax of $81.4 million in 2019 was $26.6 million, or 48.6%, higher than the $54.8 million for 2018. The $26.6 million increase reflected a $20.4 million, or 16.9%, increase in net interest income and a $15.3 million, or 17.3% increase in non-interest income, excluding the SHIRA gain on sale. These increases were partially offset with an $8.3 million, or 5.5%, increase in non-interest expense, excluding the civil money penalties. The increase in net interest income primarily reflected the impact of higher balances of commercial real estate loans held for sale and other loan growth and higher loan yields resulting from Federal Reserve rate increases in 2018. The impact of the prior year rate increases was partially offset by Federal Reserve rate decreases in the latter part of 2019. In 2019 compared to 2018, the largest component of non-interest income, prepaid, debit and related fees increased $10.5 million, or 19.2%, to $65.1 million. Gain on sale of loans increased $3.6 million, or 17.4%, to $24.1 million which resulted primarily from a higher volume of loans sold into securitizations in 2019. Service fees on deposit accounts decreased $3.5 million, or 97.9%, to $75,000 as a result of the sale of the SHIRA portfolio. As a result of the sale of the SHIRA portfolio, this income category will be substantially eliminated. In 2018, $3.7 million of charges resulted from the investment in unconsolidated entity while in 2019 there were no such charges. That investment resulted from the sale of certain discontinued loans into a securitization in 2014. See Note W to the financial statements. The aforementioned $8.3 million increase in non-interest expense, exclusive of the 2019 civil money penalties, resulted primarily from increases in salaries and benefits. Salaries and benefits increased $14.4 million, or 18.1%, to $94.3 million, reflecting higher incentive compensation for loan, deposit and fee production and higher IT and other infrastructure expense. The increase in salaries and benefits was partially offset by decreases in legal, FDIC insurance, data processing and other expenses.\n\ufeff\nIn 2014, we discontinued our Philadelphia commercial lending operations following our determination that those operations were inconsistent with our strategic focus on what we believe to be lower risk and more granular and national lines of business. We currently focus our lending activities upon four specialty lending segments: SBLOC and IBLOC loans, SBA loans, vehicle fleet and equipment leasing, and the origination of loans for sale into commercial securitizations. These loans are made nationally. At year end 2019, our net discontinued assets amounted to $140.7 million compared to $197.8 million at year end 2018. As these balances are reduced, either through sales or repayment, we plan to invest the proceeds into our continuing lending lines. Additionally, at year end\n2019 a balance of $39.2 million in investment in unconsolidated entity reflected the remaining balance of the investment in discontinued loans and related assets sold into a securitization.\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and to general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the determination of our allowance for loan and lease losses and our determination of the fair value of financial instruments involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than our other significant accounting policies.\nWe determine our allowance for loan and lease losses with the objective of maintaining a reserve level we believe to be sufficient to absorb our estimated probable credit losses. We base our determination of the adequacy of the allowance on periodic evaluations of our loan portfolio and other relevant factors. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, including, among others, expected default probabilities, the amount of loss we may incur on a defaulted loan, expected commitment usage, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, value of collateral, estimated losses on consumer loans and residential mortgages, and general amounts for historical loss experience. We also evaluate economic conditions and uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in our loan portfolio. To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, we may need additional provisions for loan losses. Any such additional provisions for loan losses will be a direct charge to our earnings. See Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.\u201d\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. We estimate the fair value of a financial instrument using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs, such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair value. When observable market prices do not exist, we estimate fair value. Our valuation methods and inputs consider factors such as types of underlying assets or liabilities, rates of estimated credit losses, interest rate or discount rate and collateral. Our best estimate of fair value involves assumptions including, but not limited to, various performance indicators, such as historical and projected default and recovery rates, credit ratings, current delinquency rates, loan-to-value ratios and the possibility of obligor refinancing.\nAt the end of each quarter, we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured. From time to time, assets or liabilities may be transferred within hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date. Transfers into or out of hierarchy levels are based upon the fair value at the beginning of the reporting period.\nWe periodically review our investment portfolio to determine whether unrealized losses on securities are temporary, based on evaluations of the creditworthiness of the issuers or guarantors, and underlying collateral, as applicable. In addition, we consider the continuing performance of the securities. We recognize credit losses through the consolidated statement of operations. If management believes market value losses are temporary and that we have the ability and intention to hold those securities to maturity, we recognize the reduction in other comprehensive income, through equity. We evaluate whether an other than temporary impairment exists by considering primarily the following factors: (a) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost of the security, (b) changes in the financial condition, credit rating and near-term prospects of the issuer, (c) whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments, (d) changes in the financial condition of the security's underlying collateral and (e) the payment structure of the security. If other than temporary impairment is determined, we estimate expected future cash flows to determine the credit loss amount with a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third-party sources and internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the security.\nWe account for our stock-based compensation plans based on the fair value of the awards made, which include stock options, restricted stock, and performance based shares. To assess the fair value of the awards made, management makes assumptions as to expected stock price volatility, option terms, forfeiture rates and dividend rates. All of these estimates and assumptions may be susceptible to significant change that may impact earnings in future periods.\nWe account for income taxes under the liability method whereby we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the carrying values on our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates which will be in effect when these differences reverse. Deferred tax expense (benefit) is the result of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nRegulatory Actions\n\ufeff\nThe Bank entered into a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of a Consent Order effective August 7, 2012, which we refer to as the 2012 Consent Order. The Bank took this action without admitting or denying any charges of unsafe or unsound banking practices or violations of law or regulation. Under the 2012 Consent Order, the Bank agreed to increase its supervision of third-party relationships, develop new written compliance and related internal audit compliance programs, develop a new third-party risk management program and screen new third-party relationships as provided in the Consent Order. As part of the Consent Order, the Bank agreed to pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $172,000, which was paid in 2012. The 2012 Consent Order was amended and restated in 2015 as noted below.\n\ufeff\nOn June 5, 2014, the Bank entered into a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of a Consent Order with the FDIC, which we refer to as the 2014 Consent Order. The Bank took this action without admitting or denying any charges of unsafe or unsound banking practices or violations of law or regulation relating to the Bank's Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA, compliance program. The 2014 Consent Order requires the Bank to take certain affirmative actions to comply with its BSA obligations. Satisfaction of the requirements of the 2014 Consent Order is subject to the review of the FDIC and the Delaware State Bank Commissioner. The Bank has and expects to continue to expend significant management and financial resources to address the Bank's BSA compliance program which will reduce our net income. Expenses associated with the required look back review were significant in 2015 and 2016. The look back review was completed in the third quarter of 2016.\n\ufeff\nThe 2014 Consent Order restricts the Bank from signing and boarding new independent sales organizations, establishing new non-benefit reloadable prepaid card programs and originating Automated Clearing House transactions for new merchant-related payments until the Bank submits to the FDIC and the Delaware State Bank Commissioner a report summarizing the completion of certain BSA-related corrective actions ( BSA Report\u201d). Until the BSA Report is approved by the FDIC and Delaware State Bank Commissioner, those aspects of the growth of our card payment processing and prepaid card operations will be affected, which, unless offset by growth from existing customers and new customers in other areas of our prepaid card operations, could reduce growth of our deposits and non-interest income and, possibly, limit our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms. The Bank provided the FDIC and the Delaware State Bank Commissioner with the required BSA Report as of December 31, 2019 and it is now under review by the regulators.\n\ufeff\nOn August 27, 2015, the Bank entered into an Amendment to Consent Order, or the 2014 Consent Order Amendment, with the FDIC, amending the 2014 Consent Order. The Bank took this action without admitting or denying any additional charges of unsafe or unsound banking practices or violations of law or regulation relating to continued weaknesses in the Bank's BSA compliance program. The 2014 Consent Order Amendment provides that the Bank shall not declare or pay any dividend without the prior written consent of the FDIC and for certain assurances regarding management.\n\ufeff\nOn May 11, 2015, the Federal Reserve issued a letter, or the Supervisory Letter, to us as a result of the 2014 Consent Order and the 2014 Consent Order Amendment (which, at the time of the Supervisory Letter, was in proposed form), which provides that we shall not pay any dividends on our common stock or make any interest payments on our trust preferred securities, without the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve. It further provides that we may not incur any debt (excluding payables in the ordinary course of business) or redeem any shares of our stock, without the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve. The requirement for such approval was lifted by the Federal Reserve in the fourth quarter of 2019, and the Supervisory Letter was terminated at that time.\n\ufeff\nOn December 23, 2015, the Bank entered into a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of an Amended Consent Order, Order for Restitution, and Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty with the FDIC, which we refer to as the 2015 Consent Order. The Bank took this action without admitting or denying any charges of violations of law or regulation. The 2015 Consent Order amended and restated in its entirety the terms of the 2012 Consent Order.\n\ufeff\nThe 2015 Consent Order was based on FDIC allegations regarding electronic fund transfer, or EFT, error resolution practices, account termination practices and fee practices of various third parties with whom the Bank had previously provided, or currently provides, deposit-related products whom we refer to as Third Parties. The 2015 Consent Order continues the Bank's obligations\noriginally set forth in the 2012 Consent Order, including its obligations to increase board oversight of the Bank's compliance management system, or CMS, improve the Bank's CMS, enhance its internal audit program, increase its management and oversight of Third Parties, and correct any apparent violations of law.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to restating the general terms of the 2012 Consent Order, the 2015 Consent Order directs the Bank's Board of Directors to establish a Complaint and Error Claim Oversight and Review Committee, which we refer to as the Complaint and Error Claim Committee to review and oversee the Bank's processes and practices for handling, monitoring and resolving consumer complaints and EFT error claims (whether received directly or through Third Parties) and to review management's plans for correcting any weaknesses that may be found in such processes and practices. The Bank's Board of Directors appointed the required Complaint and Error Claim Committee on January 29, 2016.\n\ufeff\nThe 2015 Consent Order also requires the Bank to implement a corrective action plan, or CAP, to remediate and provide restitution to those prepaid cardholders who asserted or attempted to assert, or were discouraged from initiating EFT error claims, and to provide restitution to cardholders harmed by EFT error resolution practices. The 2015 Consent Order requires that if, through the CAP, the Bank identifies prepaid cardholders who have been adversely affected by a denial or failure to resolve an EFT error claim, the Bank will ensure that monetary restitution is made. The Bank completed its implementation of the CAP on January 15, 2020. As of the completion date, $1,592,469.20 of restitution was paid to consumers of which $4,352.61 was paid by the Bank and the remaining amount by Third Parties.\n\ufeff\nThe 2015 Consent Order also imposed a $3 million civil money penalty on the Bank, which the Bank has paid and which was recognized as expense in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nOn March 7, 2018, the Bank entered into a Stipulation and Consent to Order for Restitution and Order To Pay Civil Money Penalty with the FDIC, which we refer to as the 2018 Restitution Order and 2018 CMP Order, respectively. The Bank took this action without admitting or denying any alleged violations of law or regulation. The FDIC's action principally emanated from one of the Bank's third-party payment processors ( Third-Party Processor\u201d) that suffered an internal system programming glitch. This inadvertently resulted in consumers that engaged in signature-based point of sale transactions during the period from December 2010 to November 2014 being charged a greater fee than what was disclosed by the Bank. The FDIC alleged the Bank's incorrect fee imposition due to the Third-Party Processor error was an unfair or deceptive act or practice and violated Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The 2018 CMP Order imposed a $2 million civil money penalty on the Bank which the Bank has paid, and was recognized as expense on September 30, 2017.\nThe 2018 Restitution Order required the Bank to develop a written Restitution Plan, subject to independent audit and FDIC non-objection, to ensure impacted consumers are compensated for any incorrectly charged fees. The 2018 Restitution Order required the Bank to make such reimbursements if not otherwise made by the Third-Party Processor and the Bank is indemnified by the Third-Party Processor for such reimbursements. Impacted consumers were reimbursed by the Third-Party Processor at its own expense. The civil money penalty was not subject to any indemnification or recovery from any third party. On December 19, 2019, the FDIC concluded the Bank had fully complied with the 2018 Restitution Order and issued an order terminating the 2018 Restitution Order.\nOn December 18, 2019, the Bank's Board of Directors, without admitting or denying any violations of law, regulation or the provisions of the 2014 Consent Order, executed a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of an Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty in the amount of $7.5 million based on supervisory findings during the period of 2013 to 2019 related principally to deficiencies in the Bank's legacy Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) Programs and alleged violations of law during the period, as well as the length of time the Bank has taken to fully implement the corrective actions required by the 2014 Consent Order. The Bank paid this amount, and it was recognized as an expense in the Company's financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nResults of Operations\nOverview: Net interest income continued its upward trend in 2019, increasing $20.4 million over the prior year, primarily as a result of higher balances of commercial loans originated for sale. Net interest income also benefited from increases in other loan categories. From year end 2018 to year end 2019, SBLOC and IBLOC, SBA and leasing balances grew 30%, 22% and 10%, respectively. Net interest income also reflected higher yields resulting from the Federal Reserve's 2018 interest rate increases, the impact of which was partially offset by Federal Reserve rate reductions in latter 2019. While our loans generally adjust more fully to Federal Reserve interest rate changes, funding costs generally adjust to only a portion of such rate changes. For 2019, funding costs were 22 basis points higher than 2018 compared to a 32 basis point increase in yield on interest earning assets. Reflecting the above\nfactors, net interest income increased by $20.4 million or 16.9% in 2019 compared to the prior year. The provision for loan and lease losses increased $815,000 to $4.4 million in 2019 as decreases in provisions for small business loans and leasing were more than offset by a $1.0 million provision for other consumer loans. Non-interest income in 2019 decreased by $49.7 million. That decrease reflected a $65.0 million gain on sale of the SHIRA portfolio in 2018 which was partially offset by an increase of $10.5 million in prepaid, debit card and related fees in 2019.\n\ufeff\nIn 2019, total non-interest expense increased $17.2 million to $168.5 million, reflecting a $14.4 million increase in salaries and employee benefits and $8.9 million in civil money penalties which were partially offset by decreases of $2.5 million in legal fees, $1.8 million in FDIC insurance expense and $1.3 million in data processing expense.\n\ufeff\nIn 2017, income tax expense was impacted by legislation reducing federal corporate income tax rates. As a result, deferred tax assets were adjusted to the new rates, decreasing the value of those assets and increasing tax expense in that year. The lower 21% federal corporate tax rate was effective for 2018 and 2019.\n\ufeff\nIn 2014, the Bank discontinued its regional Philadelphia commercial loan division to focus on its aforementioned national specialty lending lines of business. At year end 2019, our net discontinued assets amounted to $140.7 million compared to $197.8 million at year end 2018. Net commercial discontinued loans included in those totals were, respectively, $70.6 million and $118.1 million. These loans consisted primarily of loans secured by commercial real estate including construction and land loans. As these balances are reduced, either through sales or repayment, we plan to invest the proceeds into our continuing lending lines. Efforts to sell or otherwise dispose of these loans continue and if not sold, the loans will be retained. We also retain the financing receivable of $39.2 million from the 2014 Walnut Street securitization. See Note W to the financial statements. That entity is also primarily comprised of discontinued commercial real estate loans, including construction and land loans or real estate collateral resulting from the default of such loans.\nAt December 31, 2019, our total loans amounted to $1.82 billion, an increase of $322.3 million, or 21.5%, over the $1.50 billion balance at December 31, 2018, reflecting growth in all major categories of loans. Our investment securities available-for-sale increased $84.4 million to $1.32 billion from $1.24 billion between those respective dates as reinvestments were accelerated when long term rates increased.\nNet Income: 2019 compared to 2018. Net income from continuing operations was $51.3 million in 2019 compared to $87.5 million in 2018 while income before taxes was, respectively, $72.5 million and $119.8 million, a decrease of $47.3 million. In 2019, net interest income grew by $20.4 million and non-interest income decreased $49.7 million. The $20.4 million, or 16.9%, increase in 2019 net interest income over 2018 resulted primarily from higher balances of commercial loans originated for sale. Net interest income also benefited from increases in other loan categories. From year end 2018 to year end 2019, SBLOC and IBLOC, SBA and leasing balances grew 30%, 22% and 10%, respectively. The $49.7 million decrease in non-interest income reflected a $65.0 million gain on sale of the SHIRA portfolio in 2018 and a $10.5 million increase in prepaid, debit card and related fees in 2019.\n\ufeff\nIn 2019 compared to 2018, the primary drivers of fee income, prepaid, debit and related fees and fees on ACH, card and other payment processing fees, increased 17.8% to $74.5 million. Gain on sale of loans increased $3.6 million to $24.1 million which resulted primarily from a higher volume of loans sold into securitizations in 2019. Additionally, in 2018, $3.7 million of charges resulted from the investment in unconsolidated entity while we had no such charges in 2019. That investment resulted from the sale of certain discontinued loans into a securitization in 2014. See Note W to the financial statements. In 2019, total non-interest expense increased $17.2 million to $168.5 million, reflecting a $14.4 increase in salaries and employee benefits and $8.9 million in civil money penalties which were partially offset by decreases of $2.5 million in legal fees, $1.8 million in FDIC expense and $1.3 million in data processing expense. Salary and benefits expense increased by $14.4 million reflecting higher incentive compensation for loan, deposit and fee production and higher information technology and loan and payments infrastructure expense. In 2019, non-interest expense included $8.9 million of expense for a $1.4 million SEC civil money penalty and a $7.5 million FDIC civil money penalty. FDIC insurance expense decreased $1.8 million in 2019, primarily as a result of a decrease in the insurance rate applicable to the Bank.\n\ufeff\nIn 2017, income tax expense was impacted by legislation reducing federal corporate income tax rates. As a result, deferred tax assets were adjusted to the new rates, decreasing the value of those assets and increasing tax expense in that year. The lower 21% federal corporate tax rate was effective for 2018 and 2019. The combined federal and state income tax rate was 29% in 2019. It was higher than the 27% rate in 2018 primarily as a result of the non-deductibility of $8.9 million of civil penalties in 2019.\n\ufeff\nReflecting these changes, net income from continuing operations amounted to $51.3 million in 2019 compared to $87.5 million in 2018, or continuing operations earnings per diluted share of $0.89 compared to $1.53 in 2018. Net income from discontinued operations was $291,000 for 2019 compared to $1.1 million for 2018. Including discontinued operations, diluted income per share was $0.90 for 2019 compared to $1.55 for 2018 on net income of $51.6 million and $88.7 million, respectively.\n\ufeff\nNet Income: 2018 compared to 2017. Net income from continuing operations was $87.5 million in 2018 compared to $17.3 million in 2017 while income before taxes was, respectively, $119.8 million and $40.4 million, an increase of $79.4 million. In 2018, net interest income grew by $14.2 million and non-interest income increased $62.2 million which accounted for the majority of the increase. The $14.2 million, or 13.3%, increase in 2018 net interest income over 2017 resulted primarily from loan growth and higher yields, reflecting Federal Reserve rate increases. From year end 2017 to year end 2018, SBLOC, SBA and leasing balances grew 8%, 17% and 5%, respectively. The $62.2 million increase in non-interest income reflected a $65.0 million gain on sale of the SHIRA portfolio and a $3.2 million reduction in service fees on deposit accounts related to that portfolio.\n\ufeff\nIn 2018 compared to 2017, the primary drivers of fee income, prepaid and debit card fees and fees on ACH, card and other payment processing fees, increased 6.0% to $63.3 million. Gain on sale of loans increased $2.6 million to $20.5 million which resulted primarily from a higher volume of loans sold into securitizations in 2018. Additionally, in 2018, $3.7 million of charges resulted from the investment in unconsolidated entity while such charges in 2017 were $20,000. That investment resulted from the sale of certain discontinued loans into a securitization in 2014. See Note W to the financial statements. In 2018, total non-interest expense decreased $3.6 million to $151.3 million, reflecting a $4.0 million reduction in data processing expense resulting from a renegotiated contract and reduced transaction volume resulting from the planned exit of an affinity group which had changed ownership. Salary and benefits expense increased by $4.0 million reflecting higher BSA and compliance expenses and higher incentive compensation expense. In 2017, non-interest expense included $2.3 million of expense for an FDIC civil money penalty. FDIC insurance expense decreased $1.3 million in 2018, primarily as a result of a decrease in the insurance rate applicable to the Bank.\n\ufeff\nIn 2017, income tax expense was impacted by legislation reducing federal corporate income tax rates. As a result, deferred tax assets were adjusted to the new rates, decreasing the value of those assets and increasing tax expense in that year. The lower 21% corporate tax rate was effective for 2018 and the combined federal and state income tax rate in 2018 was 27%.\n\ufeff\nReflecting these changes, net income from continuing operations amounted to $87.5 million in 2018 compared to $17.3 million in 2017, or continuing operations income per diluted share of $1.53 compared to $0.31 in 2017. Net income from discontinued operations was $1.1 million for 2018 compared to $4.3 million for 2017. Including discontinued operations, diluted income per share was $1.55 for 2018 compared to $0.39 for 2017 on net income of $88.7 million and $21.7 million, respectively.\n\ufeff\nNet Interest Income: 2019 compared to 2018. Our net interest income for 2019 increased to $141.3 million, an increase of $20.4 million, or 16.9%, from $120.8 million for 2018, reflecting a $31.6 million, or 21.4%, increase in interest income to $179.6 million from $148.0 million for 2018. The increase in net interest income primarily reflected the impact of higher balances of commercial real estate loans held for sale and other loan growth and higher loan yields resulting from Federal Reserve rate increases in 2018. The impact of the prior year rate increases was partially offset by Federal Reserve rate decreases in the latter part of 2019. Our average loans and leases increased 24.9% to $2.42 billion in 2019 from $1.94 billion for 2018, while related interest income increased $31.8 million on a tax equivalent basis. The largest increases in average loans and leases and related interest income was in commercial loans originated for sale, which respectively increased $300.2 million and $17.6 million. Small business loan, SBLOC and IBLOC and leasing interest income respectively increased $6.3 million, $6.1 million and $2.4 million. Our average investment securities were $1.41 billion for 2019 compared to $1.38 billion for 2018, while related interest income increased $245,000 on a tax equivalent basis.\nOur net interest margin (calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest earning assets) for 2019 increased 13 basis points to 3.32% from 3.19% for 2018. The increase reflected higher yields on variable rate loans resulting from the aforementioned Federal Reserve increases, partially offset by decreased yields on taxable investment securities. While the yield on loans increased to 5.25% from 4.92%, the yield on taxable investment securities decreased to 3.01% from 3.05%. The decrease reflected higher premium amortization resulting from prepayments. The average yield on our interest earning assets increased to 4.18% from 3.86% for 2018, an increase of 32 basis points, while the cost of total deposits and interest bearing liabilities increased to 0.92% for 2019 from 0.70% for 2018, an increase of 22 basis points. While variable rate loans and securities adjusted more fully to Federal Reserve rate changes, deposits adjusted only partially to the Federal Reserve changes. In 2019, average demand and interest checking deposits amounted to $3.82 billion, compared to $3.50 billion in 2018, an increase of 9.1%. The yield on those deposits increased to 0.80% in 2019 compared to 0.66% in 2018. Savings and money market balances averaged $37.7 million in 2019\ncompared to $362.3 million in 2018 with an average 0.48% rate in 2019 compared to 0.79% in 2018. The decrease reflected the SHIRA sale.\nNet Interest Income: 2018 compared to 2017. Our net interest income for 2018 increased to $120.8 million, an increase of $14.2 million, or 13.3%, from $106.7 million for 2017, reflecting a $25.9 million, or 21.3%, increase in interest income to $148.0 million from $122.0 million for 2017. The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from higher loan balances and higher yields. Our average loans and leases increased 8.5% to $1.94 billion in 2018 from $1.78 billion for 2017, while related interest income increased $16.0 million on a tax equivalent basis. Our average investment securities were $1.38 billion for 2018 compared to $1.30 billion for 2017, while related interest income increased $5.7 million on a tax equivalent basis. Yields on both loans and investment securities increased as a result of the impact of the Federal Reserve's rate increases on variable rate loans and securities.\nOur net interest margin (calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest earning assets) for 2018 increased 15 basis points to 3.19% from 3.04% for 2017. The increase reflected higher yields on variable rate loans and securities resulting from the aforementioned Federal Reserve increases. The average yield on our interest earning assets increased to 3.86% from 3.37% for 2017, an increase of 49 basis points, while the cost of total deposits and interest bearing liabilities increased to 0.70% for 2018 from 0.40% for 2017, an increase of 30 basis points. While variable rate loans adjusted more fully to Federal Reserve rate increases, deposits adjusted only partially to Federal Reserve rate increases. In 2018, average demand and interest checking deposits amounted to $3.50 billion, compared to $3.37 billion in 2017, an increase of 3.8%. The yield on those deposits increased to 0.66% in 2018 compared to 0.36% in 2017. Savings and money market balances averaged $362.3 million in 2018 compared to $439.6 million in 2017 with an average 0.79% rate in 2018 compared to 0.51% in 2017. The decrease reflected the SHIRA sale.\nAverage Daily Balance. The following table presents the average daily balances of assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity and the respective interest earned or paid on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, as well as average rates for the periods indicated:\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

12.1%, from 2018. The increase reflected a $482.2 million, or 24.9%, increase in average loans and leases. The increase resulted primarily from higher balances in loans originated for sale into securitizations, SBLOC and IBLOC, SBA and leasing. Average balances of\ninvestment securities increased $28.6 million, or 2.1%, as reinvestments were accelerated when long term rates increased. Average demand and interest checking deposits increased $317.9 million, or 9.1%. In 2018 compared to 2017, average interest earning assets increased to $3.84 billion, an increase of $199.4 million or 5.5% from 2017, reflecting higher loan balances including loans held for sale.

Our provision for loan and lease losses was $4.4 million for 2019, $3.6 million for 2018 and $2.9 million for 2017. Provisions are based on our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses, particularly in light of current economic conditions. That evaluation reflected the impact of the levels of charge-offs. The provision for loan and lease losses increased $815,000 over the prior year, to $4.4 million in 2019, as decreases in provisions for small business loans and leasing were more than offset by a $1.0 million provision for other consumer loans. The $1.0 million provision resulted primarily from the loss on a home equity line of credit. In September 2016, this product became inactive and is no longer being marketed to customers, and the current unimpaired portfolio balance is $2.8 million, consisting of 32 accounts averaging $88,000. The increase in the 2018 provision over 2017 reflected higher provisions for SBA non-real estate and leasing. At December 31, 2019, our allowance for loan and lease losses amounted to $10.2 million, or 0.56%, of total loans. We believe that our allowance is adequate to cover expected losses. For more information about our provision and allowance for loan and lease losses and our loss experience see -Financial Condition-Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d and -Summary of Loan and Lease Loss Experience,\u201d below.\nNon-Interest Income: 2019 compared to 2018. Non-interest income was $104.1 million for 2019, compared to $153.8 million for 2018. The $49.7 million decrease reflected a $65.0 million gain on the sale of the SHIRA portfolio in 2018. In 2019 compared to 2018, the primary drivers of fee income, prepaid, debit and related fees and fees on ACH, card and other payment processing fees, increased $11.2 million, or 17.8%, to $74.5 million. The majority of the growth resulted from prepaid, debit and related fees which increased $10.5 million, or 19.2%, to $65.1 million, primarily as a result of transaction volume increases from new clients and organic growth from existing clients. ACH, card and other payment processing fees, which increased $723,000, or 8.4%,\nto $9.4 million reflected increases in payment volume, especially from the rapid funds transfer product. That product allows customers to transfer funds from their bank account to their payee's account in minutes. Gain on sale of loans increased $3.6 million to $24.1 million, which resulted primarily from a higher volume of loans sold into securitizations in 2019 which more than offset the decrease in market spreads. Any gain or loss is subject to market conditions.\nNon-Interest Income: 2018 compared to 2017. Non-interest income was $153.8 million for 2018, compared to $91.5 million for 2017. The $62.2 million increase reflected a $65.0 million gain on the sale of the SHIRA portfolio and a $3.2 million reduction in service fees on deposit accounts related to that portfolio. In 2018 compared to 2017, the primary drivers of fee income, prepaid and debit card fees and fees on ACH, card and other payment processing fees, increased $3.6 million, or 6.0%, to $63.3 million. The majority of the growth resulted from card payment and ACH processing fees, which increased $2.3 million, or 37.0%, to $8.7 million reflecting increases in payment volume, especially from the rapid funds transfer product. That product allows customers to transfer funds from their bank account to their payee's account in minutes. Prepaid and debit card fees increased $1.3 million, or 2.4%, to $54.6 million, primarily as a result of transaction volume increases from new clients and organic growth from existing clients. Gain on sale of loans increased $2.6 million to $20.5 million which resulted primarily from a higher volume of loans sold into securitizations in 2018. Additionally, in 2018, $3.7 million of charges resulted from the investment in unconsolidated entity while such charges in 2017 were $20,000. The charges reflected continued clarification of market and credit loss related assumptions based on information from available sources including updated market information and projections of potential future loan losses based on new facts or circumstances. See Non-performing loans, loans 90 days delinquent and still accruing, and troubled debt restructurings\u201d for a description of the charge related to one of those loans. The investment in unconsolidated entity resulted from the sale of certain discontinued loans into a securitization in 2014. See Note W to the financial statements. The vast majority of the $3.6 million of service fees on deposit accounts in 2018 resulted from the IRA and health savings portfolios which have now been sold.\nNon-Interest Expense: 2019 compared to 2018. Total non-interest expense in 2019 was $168.5 million, an increase of $17.2 million, or 11.4%, over the $151.3 million in 2018. Salary expense increased $14.4 million to $94.3 million in 2019, an increase of 18.1% over the $79.8 million in 2018. The increase reflected higher incentive compensation for loan, deposit and fee production and higher information technology and loan and payments infrastructure expense. Depreciation and amortization decreased $301,000 to $3.7 million, or 7.5%, from $4.0 million in 2018, which reflected reduced spending on fixed assets and equipment. Rent and occupancy increased $1.2 million to $6.6 million, or 21.1%, from $5.5 million in 2018, which reflected newly leased space for the commercial real estate loan origination department. Data processing expense decreased $1.3 million, or 20.9%, to $4.9 million from $6.2 million in 2018. The decrease reflected the impact of a renegotiated data processing contract and lower account and transaction volume as a result of the planned exit of an affinity program which had changed ownership and the SHIRA sale. Printing and supplies expense decreased $269,000, or 29.7%, to $637,000 from $906,000 in 2018. The decrease reflected a reduction for SHIRA accounts which were transferred in the third quarter of 2018, in connection with the related sale. Audit expense decreased $217,000, or 10.8%, to $1.8 million from $2.0 million in 2018, which reflected decreased regulatory and tax compliance audit fees. Legal expense decreased $2.5 million, or 32.2%, to $5.3 million from $7.8 million in 2018. The decrease in legal expense reflected lower fees related to regulatory matters including fees associated with an SEC subpoena related to the restatement of the financial statements (see -Regulatory Actions\u201d). Amortization of intangible assets remained consistent at $1.5 million in 2019 and 2018. FDIC insurance decreased $1.8 million, or 20.3%, to $7.0 million from $8.8 million in 2018, which reflected the impact of a decrease in the FDIC assessment rate. Software expense decreased $573,000, or 4.3%, to $12.7 million from $13.3 million in 2018. The decrease reflected reduced expenditures for technology infrastructure to improve efficiency and scalability, including BSA software to satisfy BSA regulatory requirements. Insurance expense decreased $103,000, or 4.0%, to $2.5 million from $2.6 million in 2018. Telecom and information technology network communications expense increased $120,000, or 8.7%, to $1.5 million from $1.4 million in 2018. Securitization and servicing expense decreased $36,000, or 30.8%, to $81,000 from $117,000 in 2018. Consulting expense remained consistent at $3.2 million in 2019 and 2018. Other non-interest expense decreased $394,000, or 3.0%, to $12.9 million from $13.3 million in 2018. The decrease resulted primarily from decreases of $317,000 in credit bureau expense, $280,000 for prepaid and debit deposit account losses, $163,000 for customer identification expense and $100,000 for postage. These decreases were partially offset by a $748,000 increase in travel.\nNon-Interest Expense: 2018 compared to 2017. Total non-interest expense in 2018 was $151.3 million, a decrease of $3.6 million, or 2.3%, over the $154.9 million in 2017. Salary expense increased $4.0 million to $79.8 million in 2018, an increase of 5.3% over the $75.8 million in 2017. The increase reflected increases in BSA and compliance expenses and higher incentive compensation expense. Depreciation and amortization decreased $455,000 to $4.0 million, or 10.2%, from $4.5 million in 2017, which reflected reduced spending on fixed assets and equipment. Rent and occupancy decreased $206,000 to $5.5 million, or 3.6%, from $5.7 million in 2017. Data processing expense decreased $4.0 million, or 39.1%, to $6.2 million from $10.2 million in 2017. The decrease reflected the impact of a renegotiated data processing contract and lower account and transaction volume as a result of the planned exit\nof an affinity program which had changed ownership. Printing and supplies expense decreased $448,000, or 33.1%, to $906,000 from $1.4 million in 2017. The decrease reflected a reduction for health savings accounts which were sold in the second quarter of 2017 and safe harbor accounts which were transferred in the third quarter of 2018. Audit expense increased $320,000, or 19.0%, to $2.0 million from $1.7 million in 2017, which reflected increased regulatory and tax compliance audit fees. Legal expense decreased $227,000, or 2.8%, to $7.8 million from $8.1 million in 2017. The decrease in legal expense reflected lower fees related to regulatory matters including fees associated with an SEC subpoena related to the restatement of the financial statements (see -Regulatory Actions\u201d). Amortization of intangible assets remained consistent at $1.5 million in 2018 and 2017. FDIC insurance decreased $1.3 million, or 12.7%, to $8.8 million from $10.1 million in 2017, which reflected the impact of a decrease in the FDIC assessment rate. Software expense increased $707,000, or 5.6%, to $13.3 million from $12.6 million in 2017. The increase reflected additional information technology infrastructure to improve efficiency and scalability, including BSA software to satisfy BSA regulatory requirements. Insurance expense increased $245,000, or 10.5%, to $2.6 million from $2.3 million in 2017. The increase reflected the impact of increased limits for liability coverages. Telecom and information technology network communications expense decreased $420,000, or 23.4%, to $1.4 million from $1.8 million in 2017, reflecting cost cutting efforts including the closure of certain locations. Securitization and servicing expense decreased $53,000, or 31.2%, to $117,000 from $170,000 in 2017. Consulting expense increased $1.0 million, or 45.4%, to $3.2 million from $2.2 million in 2017. The increased expense reflected increased BSA and other regulatory compliance consulting. Other non-interest expense decreased $199,000, or 1.5%, to $13.3 million from $13.5 million in 2017. The decrease resulted primarily from decreases of $365,000 for operations losses and recoveries, $314,000 for prepaid and debit deposit account losses, $228,000 for correspondent bank fees and $161,000 for customer identification expense. These decreases were partially offset by a $573,000 increase in travel.\nIncome Tax Benefit and Expense\nIncome tax expense for continuing operations was $21.2 million, $32.2 million and $23.1 million, respectively, for 2019, 2018 and 2017. The tax expense rate of 29.3% in 2019 was higher than the 26.9% rate in the prior year, primarily as the result of the non-deductibility of $8.9 million of civil money penalties. The difference between those rates and the federal statutory rate of 21% consisted primarily of state income taxes. The 57.1% tax expense rate in 2017 primarily reflected an adjustment through tax expense for the difference between the prior 34% and 21% tax rate which was effective for 2018, applied to total net deferred tax assets. Tax expense in 2017 was increased by that 13% differential to recognize the decrease in future value of those deferred tax assets.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity defines our ability to generate funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals, satisfy borrowing needs and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. We invest the funds we do not need for daily operations primarily in our interest bearing account at the Federal Reserve. Interest-bearing balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, maintained on an overnight basis, averaged $472.3 million for 2019, compared to $460.6 million for 2018.\n\ufeff\nOur primary source of funding has been deposits. The sale of the SHIRA portfolio was the primary factor in the $324.6 million reduction of average savings and money market balances in 2019 compared to 2018. That reduction was partially offset by growth in prepaid and debit card and other payments deposit accounts. That growth was reflected in a $317.9 million increase in average demand and interest checking balances. Additionally, $170.4 million of average time deposits were newly utilized in 2019 to fund increased commercial real estate originations held for sale. As a result, average deposits amounted to $4.03 billion in 2019 compared to $3.86 billion in 2018. Overnight borrowings were also used to fund such increased originations, and average borrowings increased to $129.0 million in 2019 from $20.3 million in 2018.\nOur primary source of liquidity is available for sale securities which amounted to $1.32 billion at December 31, 2019 compared to $1.24 billion at December 31, 2018. In excess of $800 million of our available-for-sale securities are U.S. government agency securities which are highly liquid and which may be pledged as collateral for our Federal Home Loan Bank line of credit.\nLoan repayments, also a source of funds, were exceeded by new loan disbursements during 2019. As a result, at December 31, 2019 outstanding loans amounted to $1.82 billion, compared to $1.50 billion at the prior year end, an increase of $322.3 million, which was generally funded by deposits. Commercial loans held-for-sale increased to $1.18 billion from $688.5 million between those respective dates, an increase of $492.1 million. The increase reflected increases in originations. In 2018 and 2019, the Company sold significant amounts of commercial loans held-for-sale and plans to continue that practice in 2020.\nWhile we do not have a traditional branch system, we believe that our core deposits, which include our demand, interest checking, savings and money market accounts, have similar characteristics to those of a bank with a branch system. The majority of our deposit accounts are obtained with the assistance of third parties and as a result are classified as brokered by the FDIC. The FDIC guidance for classification of deposit accounts as brokered is relatively broad, and generally includes accounts which were referred to or placed\u201d with the institution by other companies. If the Bank ceases to be categorized as well capitalized\u201d under banking regulations, it will be prohibited from accepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits without the consent of the FDIC. In such a case, the FDIC's refusal to grant consent to our accepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits could effectively restrict or eliminate the ability of the Bank to operate its business lines as presently conducted.\nWe focus on customer service which we believe has resulted in a history of customer loyalty. Stability, lower cost compared to certain other funding sources and customer loyalty comprise key characteristics of core deposits which we believe are comparable to core deposits of peers with branch systems. Certain components of our deposits do experience seasonality, creating greater excess liquidity at certain times in 2019. The largest deposit inflows occur in the first quarter of the year when certain of our accounts are credited with tax refund payments from the U.S. Treasury.\nWhile consumer transaction accounts including prepaid and debit card accounts comprise the majority of our funding needs, we maintain secured borrowing lines with the Federal Home Loan Bank, or the FHLB, and the Federal Reserve. As of December 31, 2019, we had lines of credit exceeding $250 million with the FHLB and $1.0 billion with the Federal Reserve. The FHLB line can be increased to more than $800 million, by pledging U.S. agency securities. These lines may be collateralized by specified types of loans or securities. As of December 31, 2019, we had no amounts outstanding on these borrowing lines. We expect to continue to maintain our facilities with the FHLB and Federal Reserve. We actively monitor our positions and contingent funding sources on a daily basis.\n\ufeff\nAs a result of the discontinuance of our commercial loan operations, we have received and expect to continue to receive during 2020, cash proceeds from the sale or repayment of discontinued assets. We currently anticipate that these proceeds will be deployed into loans in our continuing operations. Approximately $140.7 million of discontinued assets remained on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 (compared to $197.8 million at the prior year end), consisting primarily of loans secured by commercial real estate. If not sold, these loans will be retained until repaid. We also retain the financing receivable from the 2014 Walnut Street securitization for a portion of the discontinued commercial loans. At December 31, 2019, the balance of that receivable was $39.2 million, compared to $59.3 million at the prior year end.\n\ufeff\nIncluded in our cash and cash-equivalents at December 31, 2019, were $924.5 million of interest earning deposits, which primarily consisted of deposits with the Federal Reserve. These amounts may vary on a daily basis. Accordingly, the majority of our available liquidity is comprised of the aforementioned available-for-sale securities and lines of credit with the FHLB and Federal Reserve.\n\ufeff\nIn 2019, $173.9 million of securities sales and repayments exceeded purchases of $157.5 million. In 2018, $213.2 million of securities sales and repayments exceeded purchases of $134.8 million. In 2017, $569.7 million of securities sales and repayments were comparable to purchases of $579.9 million. At December 31, 2019, we had outstanding commitments to fund loans, including unused lines of credit, of $2.34 billion, the vast majority of which are SBLOC lines of credit which are variable rate. We attempt to increase such line usage; however, usage has been historically consistent and the majority of these lines of credit have historically not been drawn upon. As shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash required to fund loans was $326.0 million in 2019, $115.1 million in 2018 and $172.9 million in 2017.\n\ufeff\nAs a holding company conducting substantially all of our business through our bank subsidiary, our need for liquidity consists principally of cash needed to make required interest payments on our trust preferred securities. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximate cash reserves of $13.3 million at the holding company. Current quarterly interest payments on the $13.4 million of trust preferred securities are approximately $180,000 based on a floating rate of 3.25% over the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. A Supervisory Letter from the Federal Reserve, requiring its approval for any dividend from us, was lifted in 2019. FDIC approval is required for any dividend from the Bank to us, which, apart from the $13.3 million of cash on hand, is our principal source of liquidity. See Item 1, Business-Regulation under Banking Law,\u201d and Item 1A, Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-The entry into the Consent Orders has imposed certain restrictions and requirements upon us and the Bank.\u201d\n\ufeff\nWe expect that the conditions under which the 2014 Consent Order Amendment was issued will be remediated and the FDIC will permit the Bank to resume paying dividends to us to fund holding company operations. There can, however, be no assurance that the FDIC will, in fact, allow the resumption of Bank dividends to us upon completion of the remediation or, if allowed, as to the\ntiming thereof. Accordingly, there is risk that we will need to obtain alternate sources of funding at the holding company level to service our trust preferred securities. There can be no assurance that such sources would be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\n\ufeff\nWe must comply with capital adequacy guidelines issued by the FDIC. A bank must, in general, have a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0%, a ratio of Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 10.0% and a ratio of common equity to risk-weighted assets of 6.50% to be considered well capitalized\u201d. The Tier I leverage ratio is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets for the period. Tier I capital\u201d includes common shareholders' equity, certain qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less intangibles. At December 31, 2019, we were well capitalized\u201d under banking regulations.\n\ufeff\nThe following table sets forth our regulatory capital amounts and ratios for the periods indicated:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTier 1 capital\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTier 1 capital\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal capital\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nCommon equity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nto average\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nto risk-weighted\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nto risk-weighted\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\ntier 1 to risk-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nassets ratio\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nassets ratio\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nassets ratio\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nweighted assets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAs of December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nThe Bancorp, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9.63% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>19.04% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>19.45% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>19.04% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nThe Bancorp Bank\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9.46% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>18.71% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>19.11% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>18.71% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\"Well capitalized\" institution (under FDIC regulations-Basel III)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5.00% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>8.00% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>10.00% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6.50% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAs of December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nThe Bancorp, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>10.11% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>20.64% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>21.07% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>20.64% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nThe Bancorp Bank\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9.70% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>20.18% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>20.61% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>20.18% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\"Well capitalized\" institution (under FDIC regulations)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5.00% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>8.00% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>10.00% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6.50% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nAsset and Liability Management\n\ufeff\nThe management of rate sensitive assets and liabilities is essential to controlling interest rate risk and optimizing interest margins. An interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that, within a defined time period, either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market rates. Interest rate sensitivity measures the relative volatility of an institution's interest margin resulting from changes in market interest rates.\n\ufeff\nAs a financial institution, potential interest rate volatility is a primary component of our market risk. Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of our earnings and the market value of all of our interest earning assets, other than those with short-term maturities. We do not own any trading assets. We used hedging transactions only for fixed rate commercial loans originated for sale into secondary securities markets. We have discontinued making fixed rate loans requiring hedging transactions.\n\ufeff\nWe have adopted policies designed to manage net interest income and preserve capital over a broad range of interest rate movements. To effectively administer the policies and to monitor our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, we maintain an asset/liability committee, consisting of the Bank's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Credit Officer. This committee meets quarterly to review our financial results, develop strategies to optimize margins and to respond to market conditions. The primary goal of our policies is to optimize margins and manage interest rate risk, subject to overall policy constraints for prudent management of interest rate risk.\n\ufeff\nWe monitor, manage and control interest rate risk through a variety of techniques, including use of traditional interest rate sensitivity analysis (also known as gap analysis\u201d) and an interest rate risk management model. With the interest rate risk management model, we project future net interest income and then estimate the effect of various changes in interest rates and balance\nsheet growth rates on that projected net interest income. We also use the interest rate risk management model to calculate the change in net portfolio value over a range of interest rate change scenarios. Traditional gap analysis involves arranging our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities by repricing periods and then computing the difference (or interest rate sensitivity gap\u201d) between the assets and liabilities that we estimate will reprice during each time period and cumulatively through the end of each time period.\nBoth interest rate sensitivity modeling and gap analysis are done at a specific point in time and involve a variety of significant estimates and assumptions. Interest rate sensitivity modeling requires, among other things, estimates of how much and when yields and costs on individual categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will respond to general changes in market rates, future cash flows and discount rates. Gap analysis requires estimates as to when individual categories of interest sensitive assets and liabilities will reprice, and assumes that assets and liabilities assigned to the same repricing period will reprice at the same time and in the same amount. Gap analysis does not account for the fact that repricing of assets and liabilities is discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets. During a period of falling interest rates, a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income, while a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income, all else equal. During a period of rising interest rates, a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely.\n\ufeff\nThe following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing structure of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at December 31, 2019. Except as stated below, the amounts of assets or liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of each asset or liability. Loans currently at their interest rate floors are classified at their maturity date, though they are tied to variable interest rates. The majority of demand and interest bearing demand deposits and savings deposits are assumed to be core\u201d deposits, or deposits that will generally remain with us regardless of market interest rates. We estimate the repricing characteristics of these deposits based on historical performance, past experience, judgmental predictions and other deposit behavior assumptions. However, we may choose not to reprice liabilities proportionally to changes in market interest rates for competitive or other reasons. Additionally, although non-interest bearing demand accounts are not paid interest, we estimate certain of the balances will reprice as a result of the contractual fees that are paid to the affinity groups which are based upon a rate index, and therefore are included in interest expense. We have adjusted the demand and interest checking balances in the table downward, to better reflect the impact of their partial adjustment to changes in rates. Loan and security balances, which adjust more fully to market rate changes, are based upon actual balances. The table does not assume any prepayment of fixed-rate loans and mortgage-backed securities are scheduled based on their anticipated cash flow, including prepayments based on historical data and current market trends. The table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on our net interest income because the repricing and related behavior of certain categories of assets and liabilities is beyond our control as, for example, prepayments of loans and withdrawal of deposits. As a result, certain assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within a stated period may, in fact, reprice at different times and at different rate levels.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable

Certain assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in interest rates even though they reprice or mature in the same or similar time periods. The interest rates on certain assets and liabilities may change at different times than changes in market interest rates, with some changing in advance of changes in market rates and some lagging behind changes in market rates. Additionally, the actual prepayments and withdrawals we experience when interest rates change may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the data shown in the table.\n\ufeff\nBecause of the limitations in the gap analysis discussed above, we believe that interest sensitivity modeling may more accurately reflect the effects of our exposure to changes in interest rates, notwithstanding its own limitations. Net interest income simulation considers the relative sensitivities of the consolidated balance sheet including the effects of interest rate caps on adjustable rate mortgages and the relatively stable aspects of core deposits. As such, net interest income simulation is designed to address the probability of interest rate changes and the behavioral response of the consolidated balance sheet to those changes. Market Value of Portfolio Equity, or MVPE, represents the modeled fair value of the net present value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items.\n\ufeff\nWe believe that the assumptions utilized in evaluating our estimated net interest income are reasonable; however, the interest rate sensitivity of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from presumed behavior of various deposit and loan categories. The following table shows the effects of interest rate shocks on our MVPE and net interest income. Rate shocks assume that current interest rates change immediately and sustain parallel shifts. For interest rate increases or decreases of 100 and 200 basis points, our policy includes a guideline that our MVPE ratio should not decrease more than 10% and 15%, respectively, and that net interest income should not decrease more than 10% and 15%, respectively. As illustrated in the following table, we complied with our asset/liability policy at December 31, 2019. While our modeling suggests an increase in market rates will have a positive impact on margin (as shown in the table below), the amount of such increase cannot be determined, and there can be no assurance any increase will be realized.\n\ufeff\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nNet portfolio value at\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nNet interest income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercentage\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRate scenario\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nchange\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nchange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n+200 basis points\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 676,188\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2.18% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 172,557\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>11.54% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n+100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>670,847 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1.38% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>164,432 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6.29% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFlat rate\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>661,733 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>0.00% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>154,698 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>0.00% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n-100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>644,254 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-2.64%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>145,463 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-5.97%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n-200 basis points\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>578,841 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-12.53%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>136,020 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>12.07% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nIf we should experience a mismatch in our desired gap ranges or an excessive decline in our MVPE subsequent to an immediate and sustained change in interest rate, we have a number of options available to remedy such a mismatch. We could restructure our investment portfolio through the sale or purchase of securities with more favorable repricing attributes. We could also emphasize loan products with appropriate maturities or repricing attributes, or we could emphasize deposits or obtain borrowings with desired maturities.\n\ufeff\nWe do not use derivatives except for swaps outstanding for fixed rate loans which were originated for sale. The swaps hedge interest rate risk between the time the loans are disbursed and sold.\nHistorically, we have used variable rate loans as the principal means of limiting interest rate risk. The Bank's SBLOC, IBLOC and SBA loans are primarily variable rate as are the vast majority of commercial loans generated for sale. We continue to evaluate market conditions and may change our current gap strategy in response to changes in those conditions.\nFinancial Condition\nGeneral. Our total assets at December 31, 2019 were $5.66 billion, of which our total loans and commercial loans held-for-sale from continuing operations were $3.00 billion and our assets held-for-sale from discontinued operations were $140.7 million, $115.9 million of which were loans. At December 31, 2018, our total assets were $4.44 billion, of which our total loans and loans held-for-sale from continuing operations were $2.19 billion and our assets held-for-sale from discontinued operations were $197.8 million, $170.7 million of which were loans. Investment securities available-for-sale increased to $1.32 billion at December 31, 2019 from $1.24 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase in total assets at December 31, 2019 reflected increased originations of commercial loans held for sale and loan growth.\nInterest Earning Deposits and Federal Funds Sold. At December 31, 2019, we had a total of $924.5 million of interest earning deposits, comprised primarily of balances at the Federal Reserve, which pays interest on such balances. At December 31, 2018, we had $551.9 million of such balances. The increase reflected higher deposit balances, including $475.0 million of short term certificates of deposit used to fund increased commercial mortgage loan origination which are held for sale.\nInvestment Portfolio. The Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities, requires that debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale be reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income. Marking an available-for-sale portfolio to market (fair value) results in fluctuations in the level of shareholders' equity and equity-related financial ratios as market interest rates and market demand for such securities cause the fair value of fixed-rate securities to fluctuate. Debt securities for which we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are carried at amortized cost.\nFor detailed information on the composition and maturity distribution of our investment portfolio, see Note D to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Total investment securities increased to $1.41 billion on December 31, 2019, an increase of $84.3 million, or 6.4%, from a year earlier. The increase in investment securities reflected the acceleration of purchases when long term rates increased.\n\ufeff\nOther securities included in the held-to-maturity classification at December 31, 2019 consisted of three securities secured by diversified portfolios of corporate securities and one single-issuer trust preferred security.\n\ufeff\nThe trust preferred security is an unrated security issued by an insurance company with a book value of $9.2 million and a fair value of $7.2 million.\n\ufeff\nA total of $75.2 million of other debt securities is comprised of three securities secured by diversified portfolios of corporate securities, and have a fair value of $75.9 million.\n\ufeff\nUnder the accounting guidance related to the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment charges on debt securities, an impairment on a debt security is deemed to be other-than-temporary if it meets either of the following conditions: i) we intend to sell or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before a recovery in value, or ii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If we intend to sell or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before a recovery in value, a charge is recorded in net realized losses in the consolidated statement of operations equal to the difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of the security. For those other-than-temporarily impaired debt securities which do not meet the first condition and for which we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and the fair value is separated into the portion representing a credit impairment, which is recorded in net realized losses in the consolidated statement of operations, and the remaining impairment, which is recorded in other comprehensive income. Generally, a security's credit impairment is the difference between its amortized cost basis and the best estimate of its expected future cash flows discounted at the security's effective yield prior to impairment. The previous amortized cost basis, less the impairment recognized in net realized losses on the consolidated income statement, becomes the security's new cost basis. We recognized no other-than-temporary impairment charges related to trust preferred securities classified in our held-to-maturity portfolio for 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nThe following table presents the book value and the approximate fair value for each major category of our investment securities portfolio. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our investments were categorized as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity (in thousands).\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td>

Loans held-for-sale are comprised of commercial mortgage loans and SBA loans originated for sale or securitization in the secondary market. The fair value of commercial mortgage loans and the SBA loans originated for sale is based on purchase commitments, quoted prices for the same or similar loans or fair market valuations based on other market information. The analysis is performed on an individual loan basis for commercial mortgage loans and a pooled basis for SBA loans. Commercial loans held-for-sale increased to $1.18 billion at December 31, 2019 from $688.5 million at December 31, 2018. The increase resulted from an increase in the volume of commercial real estate loans originated for future sale or securitization.\n\ufeff\nLoan Portfolio. We have developed a detailed credit policy for our lending activities and utilize loan committees to oversee the lending function. SBLOC, IBLOC and other consumer loans, SBL, Leases and CMBS each have their own loan committee. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Credit Officer serve on all loan committees. Each committee also includes lenders from that particular type of specialty lending. The Chief Credit Officer is responsible for both regulatory compliance and adherence to our internal credit policy. Key committee members have lengthy experience and certain of them have had similar positions at substantially larger institutions.\nWe originate substantially all of our portfolio loans, although from time to time we purchase lease pools. If a proposed loan should exceed our lending limit, we would sell a participation in the loan to another financial institution.

</tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses. We review the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses on at least a quarterly basis to determine a provision for loan losses in an amount necessary to maintain our allowance at a level that is appropriate, based on management's estimate of inherent losses. Our estimates of loan and lease losses are intended to, and, in management's opinion, do meet the criteria for accrual of loss contingencies in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies and ASC 310, Receivables. The process of evaluating this adequacy has two basic elements: first, the identification of problem loans or leases based on current financial information and the fair value of the underlying collateral; and second, a methodology for estimating general loss reserves. For loans or leases classified as special mention\u201d or substandard\u201d, we reserve all estimated losses at the time we classify the loan or lease. This specific\u201d portion of the allowance is the total of potential, although unconfirmed, losses for individually classified loans. In this process, we establish specific reserves based on an analysis of the most probable sources of repayment and liquidation of collateral. While each impaired loan is individually evaluated, not every loan requires a reserve when the collateral value and estimated cash flows exceed the current balance. When loans are classified as troubled debt restructurings, their collateral is valued and a specific reserve is established if the collateral valuation, less disposition costs, is lower than the recorded value of the loan. At December 31, 2019, there were eleven troubled debt restructured loans with a balance of $2.1 million which had specific reserves of $1.0 million. These reserves related to the non-guaranteed portion of SBA loans for start-up businesses.\n\ufeff\nThe second phase of our analysis represents an allocation of the allowance. This methodology analyzes pools of loans that have similar characteristics and applies historical loss experience and other factors for each pool including management's experience with similar loan and lease portfolios at other institutions, the historic loss experience of our peers and a review of statistical information from various industry reports to determine the allocable portion of the allowance. This estimate is intended to represent the potential and inherent losses within the portfolio. Individual loan pools are created for major loan categories: SBLOC and IBLOC, SBA loans, direct lease financing and other specialty lending and consumer loans. We augment historical experience for each loan pool by accounting for such items as current economic conditions, current loan portfolio performance, loan policy or management changes, loan concentrations, increases in our lending limit, average loan size and other factors as appropriate. Our chief credit officer oversees the loan review department, which measures the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses independently of loan production officers. A description of loan review coverage targets is as follows.\n\ufeff\nAt December 31, 2019, in excess of 50% of the total continuing loan portfolio was reviewed. The targeted coverages and scope of the reviews are risk-based and vary according to each portfolio. These thresholds are maintained as follows:\n\ufeff\nSecurity Backed Lines of Credit (SBLOC) - The targeted review threshold for 2019 was 40% with the largest 25% of SBLOCs by commitment to be reviewed annually. A random sampling of a minimum of 20 of the remaining loans will be reviewed each quarter. At December 31, 2019, approximately 55% of the SBLOC portfolio had been reviewed.\n\ufeff\nInsurance Backed Lines of Credit (IBLOC) - The targeted review threshold for 2019 was 40%, with the largest 25% of IBLOCs by commitment to be reviewed annually. A random sampling of a minimum of 20 of the remaining loans will be reviewed each quarter. At December 31, 2019, approximately 57% of the IBLOC portfolio had been reviewed.\nSBA Loans - The targeted review or rated threshold for 2019 was 100%, to be rated and/or reviewed within 90 days of funding, less fully guaranteed loans purchased for CRA. The 100% coverage includes loans rated by designated SBA department personnel, with a review threshold for the independent loan review department of all loans exceeding $1.0 million and any classified loans. At December 31, 2019, approximately 100% of the government guaranteed loan portfolio had been rated and/or reviewed.\n\ufeff\nDirect Lease Financing - The targeted review threshold for 2019 was 35%. At December 31, 2019, approximately 54% of the leasing portfolio had been reviewed. All lease relationships exceeding $1.0 million are reviewed.\nCommercial Mortgaged Backed Securities (Floating Rate) - The targeted review threshold for 2019 was 100%. Floating rate loans will be reviewed initially within 90 days of funding and will be monitored on an ongoing basis as to payment status. Subsequent reviews will be performed based on a sampling each quarter. Each floating rate loan will be reviewed if any available extension options are exercised. At December 31, 2019, approximately 100% of the CMBS floating rate loans on the books for more than 90 days had been reviewed.\n\ufeff\nCommercial Mortgaged Backed Securities (Fixed Rate) - 100% of fixed rate loans that are unable to be readily sold on the secondary market and remain on the Bank's books after nine months will be reviewed at least annually. At December 31, 2019, approximately 100% of the CMBS fixed rate portfolio had been reviewed.\n\ufeff\nSpecialty Lending - Specialty Lending, defined as commercial loans unique in nature that do not fit into other established categories, have a review coverage threshold of 100% for non-Community Reinvestment Act ( CRA\u201d) loans. At December 31, 2019, approximately 100% of the non-CRA loans had been reviewed.\n\ufeff\nHome Equity Lines of Credit, or HELOC - The targeted review threshold for 2019 was 50%. The largest 25% of HELOCs by commitment will be reviewed annually. A random sampling of a minimum of ten of the remaining loans will be reviewed each quarter. At December 31, 2019, approximately 85% of the HELOC portfolio had been reviewed.\nThe following table presents delinquencies by type of loan for December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in

and still accruing interest and are both included in our ratios.\nThe ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans decreased to 0.56% at December 31, 2019 compared to 0.58% at December 31, 2018. The lower ratio in 2019 reflected an increase in the allowance which was relatively less than the increase in loan balances. The largest component of the increase in the allowance to $10.2 million at year end 2019 from from $8.7 million at year end 2018 was in the non guaranteed portion of SBA loans which comprise the majority of small business (SBL) loans. The allowance on SBL loan increased $1.1 million between those dates. The increase reflected the impact of historical charge-off ratios and qualitative factors which may increase such ratios, applied against the related loan category balance at period end. In addition, the total allowance includes allowances on specific loans (see -Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d). For the year 2019, the largest segment of the loan portfolio continued to be SBLOC, which has historically experienced low levels of losses as a result of the marketable securities collateralizing these loans and related loan to value requirements (see Item 1. Business-Lending-SBL Loans\u201d). The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans decreased to 113.0% at December 31, 2019 from 158.19% over the prior year end, reflecting an increase in non-performing loans, especially SBL non-real estate and leasing, which exceeded the relative increase in the allowance for loan losses. The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets increased to 0.16% from 0.12% primarily as a result of the increase in non-performing loans. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans increased to 0.12% for 2019 compared to 0.10% for the prior year, reflecting loan growth and an increase in net charge-offs in 2019 to $2.8 million from $2.0 million.\nNet Charge-Offs. Net charge-offs were $2.8 million in 2019, $2.0 million in 2018 and $2.2 million in 2017. The increase in net charge-offs in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a $1.1 million consumer loan charge-off in 2019. That charge off resulted from a home equity line of credit. In September 2016, this product became inactive and is no longer being marketed to customers, and the current unimpaired portfolio balance is $2.8 million, consisting of 32 accounts averaging $88,000.\nNon-Performing Loans, Loans 90 Days Delinquent and Still Accruing, and Troubled Debt Restructurings. Loans are considered to be non-performing if they are on a non-accrual basis or they are past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. A loan which is past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest remains on accrual status only when it is both adequately secured as to principal and interest, and is in the process of collection. Troubled debt restructurings are loans with terms that have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of a weakening in the financial positions of the\nborrowers. The following tables summarize our non-performing loans, other real estate owned (OREO) and our loans past due 90 days or more still accruing interest.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-accrual loans\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSBL non-real estate\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 3,693\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 2,590\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 1,889\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 1,530\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 733\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSBL commercial mortgage\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,047 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>458 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>693 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSBL construction\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>711 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsumer\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>345 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,468 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,414 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,442 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,194 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal non-accrual loans\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5,796 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4,516 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,996 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,972 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,927 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoans past due 90 days or more and still accruing\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,264 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>954 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>227 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>661 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>403 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal non-performing loans\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9,060 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5,470 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4,223 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,633 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,330 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther real estate owned\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>450 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>104 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal non-performing assets\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 9,060\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 5,470\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 4,673\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 3,737\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 2,330\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nIn February 2020, a single borrower under financial stress, became delinquent on vehicle loans, the total balance of which as of March 6, 2020 was $15.7 million.

On December 30, 2014, the Bank sold a portion of its discontinued commercial loan portfolio. The purchaser of the loan portfolio was a newly formed entity, Walnut Street 2014-1 Issuer, LLC or Walnut Street. The price paid to the Bank for the loan portfolio with a face value of approximately $267.6 million was approximately $209.6 million, of which approximately $193.6 million was in the form of two notes issued by Walnut Street to the Bank; a senior note in the principal amount of approximately $178.2 million bearing interest at 1.5% per year and maturing in December 2024 and a subordinate note in the principal amount of approximately $15.4 million, bearing interest at 10.0% per year and maturing in December 2024. At December 31, 2019, a balance of $39.2 million remained on the consolidated balance sheet, representing the remaining balances of these notes. Interest is not being accrued on this investment and changes in its value, determined by discounting estimated future cash flows, are recorded in the income statement under change in value of investment in unconsolidated entity\u201d. In 2019, there was no net decrease in value, compared to a $3.7 million decrease in value in 2018. A $30 million credit, collateralized by a commercial retail property with multiple tenants, is comprised of a $17.0 million loan which had been sold to Walnut Street, and $13.0 million which is\nincluded in commercial loans held-for-sale. In 2019, this loan was marked down by $1.6 million after having previously been marked down by $1.9 million. Both markdowns resulted primarily from updated appraisals. The charges to Walnut Street were based on the ratio of the $17.0 million owned by that entity to the $30 million loan balance, with the remainder of the charges reflected in net realized and unrealized gains on commercial loans originated for sale. The underlying collateral which was written down consisted of a multi-tenant shopping center. On March 13, 2019, we renewed this loan for four years and reduced the interest rate to the following: LIBOR plus 2% in year one, increasing .5% each year until the fourth year when the rate will be LIBOR plus 3.5% which will also be the rate for a one year extension, if exercised. The loan is performing in accordance with those restructured terms. The retail space is partially leased and appears to be on a path toward stabilization, based upon negotiations with prospective tenants. We previously noted that collateral securing two loans recorded at $12.1 million was in the process of disposition. The collateral has subsequently been disposed of at the approximate carrying value of the loans, which was reflected in the reduction in the balance of investment in unconsolidated entity.\n\ufeff\nAssets Held-for-Sale from Discontinued Operations. Assets held-for-sale as a result of discontinued operations, primarily commercial, commercial mortgage and construction loans, amounted to $140.7 million at December 31, 2019 and were comprised of $115.9 million of net loans and $24.8 million of other real estate owned. The balance of other real estate owned includes a Florida mall, which has been written down to $15.0 million. We expect to continue our efforts to dispose of the mall, which was appraised in September 2018 for $16.9 million. We previously noted that collateral comprised of multiple commercial properties recorded at $12.8 million as being in the process of disposition. The collateral has subsequently been partially disposed of and the remaining collateral was marked down on the basis of an updated appraisal. As a result, a related net loss of $1.6 million was recorded in income from discontinued operations. At December 31, 2019, $4.3 million of commercial real estate collateral remained on the books, after being marked down to its fourth quarter 2019 appraisal.\n\ufeff\nAt December 31, 2018, discontinued assets of $197.8 million were comprised of $170.6 million of net loans and $27.2 million of other real estate owned.\n\ufeff\nDeposits. Our primary source of funding is deposit acquisition. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms, including prepaid and debit card and demand and money market accounts. The majority of deposit balances are comprised of accounts obtained with the assistance of third parties. At December 31, 2019, we had total deposits of $5.05 billion compared to $3.94 billion at December 31, 2018, which reflected an increase of $1.12 billion, or 28.4%, between 2019 and 2018. The increase reflected $475.0 million of short-term time deposits utilized to fund increased originations of commercial real estate held for sale. The increase in deposits also reflects growth in prepaid and debit card accounts and daily balance variances. A diversified group of prepaid and debit card accounts, which have an established history of stability and lower cost than certain other types of funding, comprise the majority of our deposits. Prepaid accounts include general purpose reloadable, debit, medical spending, payroll, gift, commercial, incentive plan and other accounts.

In each case, we own all the common securities of the Trust. These trusts issued preferred capital securities to investors and invested the proceeds in us through the purchase of junior subordinated debentures issued by us. These debentures are the sole assets of the trusts. The $10.3 million of debentures issued to The Bancorp Capital Trust II on November 28, 2007, mature on March 15, 2038 and bear interest equal to 3-month LIBOR plus 3.25%. The $3.1 million of debentures issued to The Bancorp Capital Trust III on November 28, 2007 mature on March 15, 2038, and bear interest at a floating annual rate equal to 3-month LIBOR plus 3.25%.\nLong-term Borrowings. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had long term borrowings of $41.0 million and $41.7 million respectively, which consisted of sold loans which were accounted for as a secured borrowing, because they did not qualify for true sale accounting.\nShareholders' Equity. At December 31, 2019, we had $484.5 million in shareholders' equity compared to $406.8 million at the prior year end. The increase primarily reflected 2019 earnings as the Company has not paid cash dividends. The difference also reflected the increase in market value of securities resulting from the decrease in longer term interest rates.\nOff-balance Sheet Commitments\nWe are party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in our consolidated financial statements.\nCredit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss due to the failure of the other parties to a financial instrument to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. The maximum exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the same underwriting standards and policies in making credit commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments.\nFinancial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk for us at December 31, 2019, were our unused commitments to extend credit, which were approximately $2.34 billion, and standby letters of credit, which were approximately $3.5 million, at December 31, 2019. The vast majority of commitments reflect SBLOC commitments, which are variable rate, and\nconnected to lines of credit collateralized by marketable securities. The amount of the line is generally based upon the value of the collateral, and not expected usage. The majority of these available lines are not drawn upon.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and many require the payment of a fee. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued that guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Since we expect that many of the commitments or letters of credit we issue will not be fully drawn upon, the total commitment or letter of credit amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. We base the amount of collateral we obtain when we extend credit on our credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include real estate, marketable securities, pledged deposits, equipment and accounts receivable.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and other commitments, including off-balance sheet commitments, representing required and potential cash outflows as of December 31, 2019:\n\ufeff\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nOne to\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nThree to\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAfter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\none year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nthree years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nfive years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nfive years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMinimum annual rentals on\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nnoncancelable operating leases\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 20,542\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 4,314\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 7,475\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 6,531\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 2,222\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoan commitments\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,340,954 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>173,225 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>92,747 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,052 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,072,930 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSubordinated debentures\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>13,401 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>13,401 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense on subordinated\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\ndebentures (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>13,661 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>750 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,501 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,501 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9,909 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStandby letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,512 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,388 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>124 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 2,392,070\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 181,677\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 101,847\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 10,084\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 2,098,462\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(1) Presentation assumes a weighted average interest rate of 5.77%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpact of Inflation\nThe primary impact of inflation on our operations is on our operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services. While we anticipate that inflation will affect our future operating costs, we cannot predict the timing or amounts of any such effects.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nInformation on recent accounting pronouncements is set forth in Note B, item 23, to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and is incorporated herein by this reference.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of the financial condition and results of operations from 2017 to 2019. It discusses the net income, income before tax, non-interest income, non-interest expense, and changes in key areas such as loan growth, investment securities, and interest rates. It also highlights critical accounting policies and estimates related to allowance for loan and lease losses, fair value of financial instruments, stock-based compensation plans, and income taxes. Additionally, the report discusses regulatory actions and the Bank's compliance efforts. The results of operations are analyzed in detail, including net interest income, non-interest income, non-interest expense, net income, and net interest margin. The report compares the financial performance from 2018 to 2019, and from 2017 to 2018, providing insights into the factors that influenced changes in income, expenses, and overall financial results.", "item_7_tables": "", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\ufeff\nThe following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in Item 8 of this report.\nOverview\nIn 2019, we recorded net income of $51.3 million and income before tax of $72.5 million in continuing operations compared to $87.5 million and $119.8 million, respectively, in 2018. The decrease in income before tax of $47.3 million reflected a $65.0 million gain on sale of the Safe Harbor Individual Retirement Account (SHIRA) portfolio in 2018. The decrease also reflected civil money penalties of $7.5 million to the FDIC and $1.4 million to the SEC in 2019. After adjusting for the civil money penalties and gain on sale, income before tax of $81.4 million in 2019 was $26.6 million, or 48.6%, higher than the $54.8 million for 2018. The $26.6 million increase reflected a $20.4 million, or 16.9%, increase in net interest income and a $15.3 million, or 17.3% increase in non-interest income, excluding the SHIRA gain on sale. These increases were partially offset with an $8.3 million, or 5.5%, increase in non-interest expense, excluding the civil money penalties. The increase in net interest income primarily reflected the impact of higher balances of commercial real estate loans held for sale and other loan growth and higher loan yields resulting from Federal Reserve rate increases in 2018. The impact of the prior year rate increases was partially offset by Federal Reserve rate decreases in the latter part of 2019. In 2019 compared to 2018, the largest component of non-interest income, prepaid, debit and related fees increased $10.5 million, or 19.2%, to $65.1 million. Gain on sale of loans increased $3.6 million, or 17.4%, to $24.1 million which resulted primarily from a higher volume of loans sold into securitizations in 2019. Service fees on deposit accounts decreased $3.5 million, or 97.9%, to $75,000 as a result of the sale of the SHIRA portfolio. As a result of the sale of the SHIRA portfolio, this income category will be substantially eliminated. In 2018, $3.7 million of charges resulted from the investment in unconsolidated entity while in 2019 there were no such charges. That investment resulted from the sale of certain discontinued loans into a securitization in 2014. See Note W to the financial statements. The aforementioned $8.3 million increase in non-interest expense, exclusive of the 2019 civil money penalties, resulted primarily from increases in salaries and benefits. Salaries and benefits increased $14.4 million, or 18.1%, to $94.3 million, reflecting higher incentive compensation for loan, deposit and fee production and higher IT and other infrastructure expense. The increase in salaries and benefits was partially offset by decreases in legal, FDIC insurance, data processing and other expenses.\n\ufeff\nIn 2014, we discontinued our Philadelphia commercial lending operations following our determination that those operations were inconsistent with our strategic focus on what we believe to be lower risk and more granular and national lines of business. We currently focus our lending activities upon four specialty lending segments: SBLOC and IBLOC loans, SBA loans, vehicle fleet and equipment leasing, and the origination of loans for sale into commercial securitizations. These loans are made nationally. At year end 2019, our net discontinued assets amounted to $140.7 million compared to $197.8 million at year end 2018. As these balances are reduced, either through sales or repayment, we plan to invest the proceeds into our continuing lending lines. Additionally, at year end\n2019 a balance of $39.2 million in investment in unconsolidated entity reflected the remaining balance of the investment in discontinued loans and related assets sold into a securitization.\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and to general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the determination of our allowance for loan and lease losses and our determination of the fair value of financial instruments involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than our other significant accounting policies.\nWe determine our allowance for loan and lease losses with the objective of maintaining a reserve level we believe to be sufficient to absorb our estimated probable credit losses. We base our determination of the adequacy of the allowance on periodic evaluations of our loan portfolio and other relevant factors. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, including, among others, expected default probabilities, the amount of loss we may incur on a defaulted loan, expected commitment usage, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, value of collateral, estimated losses on consumer loans and residential mortgages, and general amounts for historical loss experience. We also evaluate economic conditions and uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in our loan portfolio. To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, we may need additional provisions for loan losses. Any such additional provisions for loan losses will be a direct charge to our earnings. See Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.\u201d\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. We estimate the fair value of a financial instrument using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs, such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair value. When observable market prices do not exist, we estimate fair value. Our valuation methods and inputs consider factors such as types of underlying assets or liabilities, rates of estimated credit losses, interest rate or discount rate and collateral. Our best estimate of fair value involves assumptions including, but not limited to, various performance indicators, such as historical and projected default and recovery rates, credit ratings, current delinquency rates, loan-to-value ratios and the possibility of obligor refinancing.\nAt the end of each quarter, we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured. From time to time, assets or liabilities may be transferred within hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date. Transfers into or out of hierarchy levels are based upon the fair value at the beginning of the reporting period.\nWe periodically review our investment portfolio to determine whether unrealized losses on securities are temporary, based on evaluations of the creditworthiness of the issuers or guarantors, and underlying collateral, as applicable. In addition, we consider the continuing performance of the securities. We recognize credit losses through the consolidated statement of operations. If management believes market value losses are temporary and that we have the ability and intention to hold those securities to maturity, we recognize the reduction in other comprehensive income, through equity. We evaluate whether an other than temporary impairment exists by considering primarily the following factors: (a) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost of the security, (b) changes in the financial condition, credit rating and near-term prospects of the issuer, (c) whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments, (d) changes in the financial condition of the security's underlying collateral and (e) the payment structure of the security. If other than temporary impairment is determined, we estimate expected future cash flows to determine the credit loss amount with a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third-party sources and internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the security.\nWe account for our stock-based compensation plans based on the fair value of the awards made, which include stock options, restricted stock, and performance based shares. To assess the fair value of the awards made, management makes assumptions as to expected stock price volatility, option terms, forfeiture rates and dividend rates. All of these estimates and assumptions may be susceptible to significant change that may impact earnings in future periods.\nWe account for income taxes under the liability method whereby we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the carrying values on our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates which will be in effect when these differences reverse. Deferred tax expense (benefit) is the result of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nRegulatory Actions\n\ufeff\nThe Bank entered into a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of a Consent Order effective August 7, 2012, which we refer to as the 2012 Consent Order. The Bank took this action without admitting or denying any charges of unsafe or unsound banking practices or violations of law or regulation. Under the 2012 Consent Order, the Bank agreed to increase its supervision of third-party relationships, develop new written compliance and related internal audit compliance programs, develop a new third-party risk management program and screen new third-party relationships as provided in the Consent Order. As part of the Consent Order, the Bank agreed to pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $172,000, which was paid in 2012. The 2012 Consent Order was amended and restated in 2015 as noted below.\n\ufeff\nOn June 5, 2014, the Bank entered into a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of a Consent Order with the FDIC, which we refer to as the 2014 Consent Order. The Bank took this action without admitting or denying any charges of unsafe or unsound banking practices or violations of law or regulation relating to the Bank's Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA, compliance program. The 2014 Consent Order requires the Bank to take certain affirmative actions to comply with its BSA obligations. Satisfaction of the requirements of the 2014 Consent Order is subject to the review of the FDIC and the Delaware State Bank Commissioner. The Bank has and expects to continue to expend significant management and financial resources to address the Bank's BSA compliance program which will reduce our net income. Expenses associated with the required look back review were significant in 2015 and 2016. The look back review was completed in the third quarter of 2016.\n\ufeff\nThe 2014 Consent Order restricts the Bank from signing and boarding new independent sales organizations, establishing new non-benefit reloadable prepaid card programs and originating Automated Clearing House transactions for new merchant-related payments until the Bank submits to the FDIC and the Delaware State Bank Commissioner a report summarizing the completion of certain BSA-related corrective actions ( BSA Report\u201d). Until the BSA Report is approved by the FDIC and Delaware State Bank Commissioner, those aspects of the growth of our card payment processing and prepaid card operations will be affected, which, unless offset by growth from existing customers and new customers in other areas of our prepaid card operations, could reduce growth of our deposits and non-interest income and, possibly, limit our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms. The Bank provided the FDIC and the Delaware State Bank Commissioner with the required BSA Report as of December 31, 2019 and it is now under review by the regulators.\n\ufeff\nOn August 27, 2015, the Bank entered into an Amendment to Consent Order, or the 2014 Consent Order Amendment, with the FDIC, amending the 2014 Consent Order. The Bank took this action without admitting or denying any additional charges of unsafe or unsound banking practices or violations of law or regulation relating to continued weaknesses in the Bank's BSA compliance program. The 2014 Consent Order Amendment provides that the Bank shall not declare or pay any dividend without the prior written consent of the FDIC and for certain assurances regarding management.\n\ufeff\nOn May 11, 2015, the Federal Reserve issued a letter, or the Supervisory Letter, to us as a result of the 2014 Consent Order and the 2014 Consent Order Amendment (which, at the time of the Supervisory Letter, was in proposed form), which provides that we shall not pay any dividends on our common stock or make any interest payments on our trust preferred securities, without the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve. It further provides that we may not incur any debt (excluding payables in the ordinary course of business) or redeem any shares of our stock, without the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve. The requirement for such approval was lifted by the Federal Reserve in the fourth quarter of 2019, and the Supervisory Letter was terminated at that time.\n\ufeff\nOn December 23, 2015, the Bank entered into a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of an Amended Consent Order, Order for Restitution, and Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty with the FDIC, which we refer to as the 2015 Consent Order. The Bank took this action without admitting or denying any charges of violations of law or regulation. The 2015 Consent Order amended and restated in its entirety the terms of the 2012 Consent Order.\n\ufeff\nThe 2015 Consent Order was based on FDIC allegations regarding electronic fund transfer, or EFT, error resolution practices, account termination practices and fee practices of various third parties with whom the Bank had previously provided, or currently provides, deposit-related products whom we refer to as Third Parties. The 2015 Consent Order continues the Bank's obligations\noriginally set forth in the 2012 Consent Order, including its obligations to increase board oversight of the Bank's compliance management system, or CMS, improve the Bank's CMS, enhance its internal audit program, increase its management and oversight of Third Parties, and correct any apparent violations of law.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to restating the general terms of the 2012 Consent Order, the 2015 Consent Order directs the Bank's Board of Directors to establish a Complaint and Error Claim Oversight and Review Committee, which we refer to as the Complaint and Error Claim Committee to review and oversee the Bank's processes and practices for handling, monitoring and resolving consumer complaints and EFT error claims (whether received directly or through Third Parties) and to review management's plans for correcting any weaknesses that may be found in such processes and practices. The Bank's Board of Directors appointed the required Complaint and Error Claim Committee on January 29, 2016.\n\ufeff\nThe 2015 Consent Order also requires the Bank to implement a corrective action plan, or CAP, to remediate and provide restitution to those prepaid cardholders who asserted or attempted to assert, or were discouraged from initiating EFT error claims, and to provide restitution to cardholders harmed by EFT error resolution practices. The 2015 Consent Order requires that if, through the CAP, the Bank identifies prepaid cardholders who have been adversely affected by a denial or failure to resolve an EFT error claim, the Bank will ensure that monetary restitution is made. The Bank completed its implementation of the CAP on January 15, 2020. As of the completion date, $1,592,469.20 of restitution was paid to consumers of which $4,352.61 was paid by the Bank and the remaining amount by Third Parties.\n\ufeff\nThe 2015 Consent Order also imposed a $3 million civil money penalty on the Bank, which the Bank has paid and which was recognized as expense in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nOn March 7, 2018, the Bank entered into a Stipulation and Consent to Order for Restitution and Order To Pay Civil Money Penalty with the FDIC, which we refer to as the 2018 Restitution Order and 2018 CMP Order, respectively. The Bank took this action without admitting or denying any alleged violations of law or regulation. The FDIC's action principally emanated from one of the Bank's third-party payment processors ( Third-Party Processor\u201d) that suffered an internal system programming glitch. This inadvertently resulted in consumers that engaged in signature-based point of sale transactions during the period from December 2010 to November 2014 being charged a greater fee than what was disclosed by the Bank. The FDIC alleged the Bank's incorrect fee imposition due to the Third-Party Processor error was an unfair or deceptive act or practice and violated Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The 2018 CMP Order imposed a $2 million civil money penalty on the Bank which the Bank has paid, and was recognized as expense on September 30, 2017.\nThe 2018 Restitution Order required the Bank to develop a written Restitution Plan, subject to independent audit and FDIC non-objection, to ensure impacted consumers are compensated for any incorrectly charged fees. The 2018 Restitution Order required the Bank to make such reimbursements if not otherwise made by the Third-Party Processor and the Bank is indemnified by the Third-Party Processor for such reimbursements. Impacted consumers were reimbursed by the Third-Party Processor at its own expense. The civil money penalty was not subject to any indemnification or recovery from any third party. On December 19, 2019, the FDIC concluded the Bank had fully complied with the 2018 Restitution Order and issued an order terminating the 2018 Restitution Order.\nOn December 18, 2019, the Bank's Board of Directors, without admitting or denying any violations of law, regulation or the provisions of the 2014 Consent Order, executed a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of an Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty in the amount of $7.5 million based on supervisory findings during the period of 2013 to 2019 related principally to deficiencies in the Bank's legacy Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) Programs and alleged violations of law during the period, as well as the length of time the Bank has taken to fully implement the corrective actions required by the 2014 Consent Order. The Bank paid this amount, and it was recognized as an expense in the Company's financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nResults of Operations\nOverview: Net interest income continued its upward trend in 2019, increasing $20.4 million over the prior year, primarily as a result of higher balances of commercial loans originated for sale. Net interest income also benefited from increases in other loan categories. From year end 2018 to year end 2019, SBLOC and IBLOC, SBA and leasing balances grew 30%, 22% and 10%, respectively. Net interest income also reflected higher yields resulting from the Federal Reserve's 2018 interest rate increases, the impact of which was partially offset by Federal Reserve rate reductions in latter 2019. While our loans generally adjust more fully to Federal Reserve interest rate changes, funding costs generally adjust to only a portion of such rate changes. For 2019, funding costs were 22 basis points higher than 2018 compared to a 32 basis point increase in yield on interest earning assets. Reflecting the above\nfactors, net interest income increased by $20.4 million or 16.9% in 2019 compared to the prior year. The provision for loan and lease losses increased $815,000 to $4.4 million in 2019 as decreases in provisions for small business loans and leasing were more than offset by a $1.0 million provision for other consumer loans. Non-interest income in 2019 decreased by $49.7 million. That decrease reflected a $65.0 million gain on sale of the SHIRA portfolio in 2018 which was partially offset by an increase of $10.5 million in prepaid, debit card and related fees in 2019.\n\ufeff\nIn 2019, total non-interest expense increased $17.2 million to $168.5 million, reflecting a $14.4 million increase in salaries and employee benefits and $8.9 million in civil money penalties which were partially offset by decreases of $2.5 million in legal fees, $1.8 million in FDIC insurance expense and $1.3 million in data processing expense.\n\ufeff\nIn 2017, income tax expense was impacted by legislation reducing federal corporate income tax rates. As a result, deferred tax assets were adjusted to the new rates, decreasing the value of those assets and increasing tax expense in that year. The lower 21% federal corporate tax rate was effective for 2018 and 2019.\n\ufeff\nIn 2014, the Bank discontinued its regional Philadelphia commercial loan division to focus on its aforementioned national specialty lending lines of business. At year end 2019, our net discontinued assets amounted to $140.7 million compared to $197.8 million at year end 2018. Net commercial discontinued loans included in those totals were, respectively, $70.6 million and $118.1 million. These loans consisted primarily of loans secured by commercial real estate including construction and land loans. As these balances are reduced, either through sales or repayment, we plan to invest the proceeds into our continuing lending lines. Efforts to sell or otherwise dispose of these loans continue and if not sold, the loans will be retained. We also retain the financing receivable of $39.2 million from the 2014 Walnut Street securitization. See Note W to the financial statements. That entity is also primarily comprised of discontinued commercial real estate loans, including construction and land loans or real estate collateral resulting from the default of such loans.\nAt December 31, 2019, our total loans amounted to $1.82 billion, an increase of $322.3 million, or 21.5%, over the $1.50 billion balance at December 31, 2018, reflecting growth in all major categories of loans. Our investment securities available-for-sale increased $84.4 million to $1.32 billion from $1.24 billion between those respective dates as reinvestments were accelerated when long term rates increased.\nNet Income: 2019 compared to 2018. Net income from continuing operations was $51.3 million in 2019 compared to $87.5 million in 2018 while income before taxes was, respectively, $72.5 million and $119.8 million, a decrease of $47.3 million. In 2019, net interest income grew by $20.4 million and non-interest income decreased $49.7 million. The $20.4 million, or 16.9%, increase in 2019 net interest income over 2018 resulted primarily from higher balances of commercial loans originated for sale. Net interest income also benefited from increases in other loan categories. From year end 2018 to year end 2019, SBLOC and IBLOC, SBA and leasing balances grew 30%, 22% and 10%, respectively. The $49.7 million decrease in non-interest income reflected a $65.0 million gain on sale of the SHIRA portfolio in 2018 and a $10.5 million increase in prepaid, debit card and related fees in 2019.\n\ufeff\nIn 2019 compared to 2018, the primary drivers of fee income, prepaid, debit and related fees and fees on ACH, card and other payment processing fees, increased 17.8% to $74.5 million. Gain on sale of loans increased $3.6 million to $24.1 million which resulted primarily from a higher volume of loans sold into securitizations in 2019. Additionally, in 2018, $3.7 million of charges resulted from the investment in unconsolidated entity while we had no such charges in 2019. That investment resulted from the sale of certain discontinued loans into a securitization in 2014. See Note W to the financial statements. In 2019, total non-interest expense increased $17.2 million to $168.5 million, reflecting a $14.4 increase in salaries and employee benefits and $8.9 million in civil money penalties which were partially offset by decreases of $2.5 million in legal fees, $1.8 million in FDIC expense and $1.3 million in data processing expense. Salary and benefits expense increased by $14.4 million reflecting higher incentive compensation for loan, deposit and fee production and higher information technology and loan and payments infrastructure expense. In 2019, non-interest expense included $8.9 million of expense for a $1.4 million SEC civil money penalty and a $7.5 million FDIC civil money penalty. FDIC insurance expense decreased $1.8 million in 2019, primarily as a result of a decrease in the insurance rate applicable to the Bank.\n\ufeff\nIn 2017, income tax expense was impacted by legislation reducing federal corporate income tax rates. As a result, deferred tax assets were adjusted to the new rates, decreasing the value of those assets and increasing tax expense in that year. The lower 21% federal corporate tax rate was effective for 2018 and 2019. The combined federal and state income tax rate was 29% in 2019. It was higher than the 27% rate in 2018 primarily as a result of the non-deductibility of $8.9 million of civil penalties in 2019.\n\ufeff\nReflecting these changes, net income from continuing operations amounted to $51.3 million in 2019 compared to $87.5 million in 2018, or continuing operations earnings per diluted share of $0.89 compared to $1.53 in 2018. Net income from discontinued operations was $291,000 for 2019 compared to $1.1 million for 2018. Including discontinued operations, diluted income per share was $0.90 for 2019 compared to $1.55 for 2018 on net income of $51.6 million and $88.7 million, respectively.\n\ufeff\nNet Income: 2018 compared to 2017. Net income from continuing operations was $87.5 million in 2018 compared to $17.3 million in 2017 while income before taxes was, respectively, $119.8 million and $40.4 million, an increase of $79.4 million. In 2018, net interest income grew by $14.2 million and non-interest income increased $62.2 million which accounted for the majority of the increase. The $14.2 million, or 13.3%, increase in 2018 net interest income over 2017 resulted primarily from loan growth and higher yields, reflecting Federal Reserve rate increases. From year end 2017 to year end 2018, SBLOC, SBA and leasing balances grew 8%, 17% and 5%, respectively. The $62.2 million increase in non-interest income reflected a $65.0 million gain on sale of the SHIRA portfolio and a $3.2 million reduction in service fees on deposit accounts related to that portfolio.\n\ufeff\nIn 2018 compared to 2017, the primary drivers of fee income, prepaid and debit card fees and fees on ACH, card and other payment processing fees, increased 6.0% to $63.3 million. Gain on sale of loans increased $2.6 million to $20.5 million which resulted primarily from a higher volume of loans sold into securitizations in 2018. Additionally, in 2018, $3.7 million of charges resulted from the investment in unconsolidated entity while such charges in 2017 were $20,000. That investment resulted from the sale of certain discontinued loans into a securitization in 2014. See Note W to the financial statements. In 2018, total non-interest expense decreased $3.6 million to $151.3 million, reflecting a $4.0 million reduction in data processing expense resulting from a renegotiated contract and reduced transaction volume resulting from the planned exit of an affinity group which had changed ownership. Salary and benefits expense increased by $4.0 million reflecting higher BSA and compliance expenses and higher incentive compensation expense. In 2017, non-interest expense included $2.3 million of expense for an FDIC civil money penalty. FDIC insurance expense decreased $1.3 million in 2018, primarily as a result of a decrease in the insurance rate applicable to the Bank.\n\ufeff\nIn 2017, income tax expense was impacted by legislation reducing federal corporate income tax rates. As a result, deferred tax assets were adjusted to the new rates, decreasing the value of those assets and increasing tax expense in that year. The lower 21% corporate tax rate was effective for 2018 and the combined federal and state income tax rate in 2018 was 27%.\n\ufeff\nReflecting these changes, net income from continuing operations amounted to $87.5 million in 2018 compared to $17.3 million in 2017, or continuing operations income per diluted share of $1.53 compared to $0.31 in 2017. Net income from discontinued operations was $1.1 million for 2018 compared to $4.3 million for 2017. Including discontinued operations, diluted income per share was $1.55 for 2018 compared to $0.39 for 2017 on net income of $88.7 million and $21.7 million, respectively.\n\ufeff\nNet Interest Income: 2019 compared to 2018. Our net interest income for 2019 increased to $141.3 million, an increase of $20.4 million, or 16.9%, from $120.8 million for 2018, reflecting a $31.6 million, or 21.4%, increase in interest income to $179.6 million from $148.0 million for 2018. The increase in net interest income primarily reflected the impact of higher balances of commercial real estate loans held for sale and other loan growth and higher loan yields resulting from Federal Reserve rate increases in 2018. The impact of the prior year rate increases was partially offset by Federal Reserve rate decreases in the latter part of 2019. Our average loans and leases increased 24.9% to $2.42 billion in 2019 from $1.94 billion for 2018, while related interest income increased $31.8 million on a tax equivalent basis. The largest increases in average loans and leases and related interest income was in commercial loans originated for sale, which respectively increased $300.2 million and $17.6 million. Small business loan, SBLOC and IBLOC and leasing interest income respectively increased $6.3 million, $6.1 million and $2.4 million. Our average investment securities were $1.41 billion for 2019 compared to $1.38 billion for 2018, while related interest income increased $245,000 on a tax equivalent basis.\nOur net interest margin (calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest earning assets) for 2019 increased 13 basis points to 3.32% from 3.19% for 2018. The increase reflected higher yields on variable rate loans resulting from the aforementioned Federal Reserve increases, partially offset by decreased yields on taxable investment securities. While the yield on loans increased to 5.25% from 4.92%, the yield on taxable investment securities decreased to 3.01% from 3.05%. The decrease reflected higher premium amortization resulting from prepayments. The average yield on our interest earning assets increased to 4.18% from 3.86% for 2018, an increase of 32 basis points, while the cost of total deposits and interest bearing liabilities increased to 0.92% for 2019 from 0.70% for 2018, an increase of 22 basis points. While variable rate loans and securities adjusted more fully to Federal Reserve rate changes, deposits adjusted only partially to the Federal Reserve changes. In 2019, average demand and interest checking deposits amounted to $3.82 billion, compared to $3.50 billion in 2018, an increase of 9.1%. The yield on those deposits increased to 0.80% in 2019 compared to 0.66% in 2018. Savings and money market balances averaged $37.7 million in 2019\ncompared to $362.3 million in 2018 with an average 0.48% rate in 2019 compared to 0.79% in 2018. The decrease reflected the SHIRA sale.\nNet Interest Income: 2018 compared to", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\ufeff\nThe following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in Item 8 of this report.\nOverview\nIn 2019, we recorded net income of $51.3 million and income before tax of $72.5 million in continuing operations compared to $87.5 million and $119.8 million, respectively, in 2018. The decrease in income before tax of $47.3 million reflected a $65.0 million gain on sale of the Safe Harbor Individual Retirement Account (SHIRA) portfolio in 2018. The decrease also reflected civil money penalties of $7.5 million to the FDIC and $1.4 million to the SEC in 2019. After adjusting for the civil money penalties and gain on sale, income before tax of $81.4 million in 2019 was $26.6 million, or 48.6%, higher than the $54.8 million for 2018. The $26.6 million increase reflected a $20.4 million, or 16.9%, increase in net interest income and a $15.3 million, or 17.3% increase in non-interest income, excluding the SHIRA gain on sale. These increases were partially offset with an $8.3 million, or 5.5%, increase in non-interest expense, excluding the civil money penalties. The increase in net interest income primarily reflected the impact of higher balances of commercial real estate loans held for sale and other loan growth and higher loan yields resulting from Federal Reserve rate increases in 2018. The impact of the prior year rate increases was partially offset by Federal Reserve rate decreases in the latter part of 2019. In 2019 compared to 2018, the largest component of non-interest income, prepaid, debit and related fees increased $10.5 million, or 19.2%, to $65.1 million. Gain on sale of loans increased $3.6 million, or 17.4%, to $24.1 million which resulted primarily from a higher volume of loans sold into securitizations in 2019. Service fees on deposit accounts decreased $3.5 million, or 97.9%, to $75,000 as a result of the sale of the SHIRA portfolio. As a result of the sale of the SHIRA portfolio, this income category will be substantially eliminated. In 2018, $3.7 million of charges resulted from the investment in unconsolidated entity while in 2019 there were no such charges. That investment resulted from the sale of certain discontinued loans into a securitization in 2014. See Note W to the financial statements. The aforementioned $8.3 million increase in non-interest expense, exclusive of the 2019 civil money penalties, resulted primarily from increases in salaries and benefits. Salaries and benefits increased $14.4 million, or 18.1%, to $94.3 million, reflecting higher incentive compensation for loan, deposit and fee production and higher IT and other infrastructure expense. The increase in salaries and benefits was partially offset by decreases in legal, FDIC insurance, data processing and other expenses.\n\ufeff\nIn 2014, we discontinued our Philadelphia commercial lending operations following our determination that those operations were inconsistent with our strategic focus on what we believe to be lower risk and more granular and national lines of business. We currently focus our lending activities upon four specialty lending segments: SBLOC and IBLOC loans, SBA loans, vehicle fleet and equipment leasing, and the origination of loans for sale into commercial securitizations. These loans are made nationally. At year end 2019, our net discontinued assets amounted to $140.7 million compared to $197.8 million at year end 2018. As these balances are reduced, either through sales or repayment, we plan to invest the proceeds into our continuing lending lines. Additionally, at year end\n2019 a balance of $39.2 million in investment in unconsolidated entity reflected the remaining balance of the investment in discontinued loans and related assets sold into a securitization.\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and to general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the determination of our allowance for loan and lease losses and our determination of the fair value of financial instruments involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than our other significant accounting policies.\nWe determine our allowance for loan and lease losses with the objective of maintaining a reserve level we believe to be sufficient to absorb our estimated probable credit losses. We base our determination of the adequacy of the allowance on periodic evaluations of our loan portfolio and other relevant factors. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, including, among others, expected default probabilities, the amount of loss we may incur on a defaulted loan, expected commitment usage, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, value of collateral, estimated losses on consumer loans and residential mortgages, and general amounts for historical loss experience. We also evaluate economic conditions and uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in our loan portfolio. To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, we may need additional provisions for loan losses. Any such additional provisions for loan losses will be a direct charge to our earnings. See Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.\u201d\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. We estimate the fair value of a financial instrument using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs, such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair value. When observable market prices do not exist, we estimate fair value. Our valuation methods and inputs consider factors such as types of underlying assets or liabilities, rates of estimated credit losses, interest rate or discount rate and collateral. Our best estimate of fair value involves assumptions including, but not limited to, various performance indicators, such as historical and projected default and recovery rates, credit ratings, current delinquency rates, loan-to-value ratios and the possibility of obligor refinancing.\nAt the end of each quarter, we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured. From time to time, assets or liabilities may be transferred within hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date. Transfers into or out of hierarchy levels are based upon the fair value at the beginning of the reporting period.\nWe periodically review our investment portfolio to determine whether unrealized losses on securities are temporary, based on evaluations of the creditworthiness of the issuers or guarantors, and underlying collateral, as applicable. In addition, we consider the continuing performance of the securities. We recognize credit losses through the consolidated statement of operations. If management believes market value losses are temporary and that we have the ability and intention to hold those securities to maturity, we recognize the reduction in other comprehensive income, through equity. We evaluate whether an other than temporary impairment exists by considering primarily the following factors: (a) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost of the security, (b) changes in the financial condition, credit rating and near-term prospects of the issuer, (c) whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments, (d) changes in the financial condition of the security's underlying collateral and (e) the payment structure of the security. If other than temporary impairment is determined, we estimate expected future cash flows to determine the credit loss amount with a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third-party sources and internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the security.\nWe account for our stock-based compensation plans based on the fair value of the awards made, which include stock options, restricted stock, and performance based shares. To assess the fair value of the awards made, management makes assumptions as to expected stock price volatility, option terms, forfeiture rates and dividend rates. All of these estimates and assumptions may be susceptible to significant change that may impact earnings in future periods.\nWe account for income taxes under the liability method whereby we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the carrying values on our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates which will be in effect when these differences reverse. Deferred tax expense (benefit) is the result of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nRegulatory Actions\n\ufeff\nThe Bank entered into a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of a Consent Order effective August 7, 2012, which we refer to as the 2012 Consent Order. The Bank took this action without admitting or denying any charges of unsafe or unsound banking practices or violations of law or regulation. Under the 2012 Consent Order, the Bank agreed to increase its supervision of third-party relationships, develop new written compliance and related internal audit compliance programs, develop a new third-party risk management program and screen new third-party relationships as provided in the Consent Order. As part of the Consent Order, the Bank agreed to pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $172,000, which was paid in 2012. The 2012 Consent Order was amended and restated in 2015 as noted below.\n\ufeff\nOn June 5, 2014, the Bank entered into a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of a Consent Order with the FDIC, which we refer to as the 2014 Consent Order. The Bank took this action without admitting or denying any charges of unsafe or unsound banking practices or violations of law or regulation relating to the Bank's Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA, compliance program. The 2014 Consent Order requires the Bank to take certain affirmative actions to comply with its BSA obligations. Satisfaction of the requirements of the 2014 Consent Order is subject to the review of the FDIC and the Delaware State Bank Commissioner. The Bank has and expects to continue to expend significant management and financial resources to address the Bank's BSA compliance program which will reduce our net income. Expenses associated with the required look back review were significant in 2015 and 2016. The look back review was completed in the third quarter of 2016.\n\ufeff\nThe 2014 Consent Order restricts the Bank from signing and boarding new independent sales organizations, establishing new non-benefit reloadable prepaid card programs and originating Automated Clearing House transactions for new merchant-related payments until the Bank submits to the FDIC and the Delaware State Bank Commissioner a report summarizing the completion of certain BSA-related corrective actions ( BSA Report\u201d). Until the BSA Report is approved by the FDIC and Delaware State Bank Commissioner, those aspects of the growth of our card payment processing and prepaid card operations will be affected, which, unless offset by growth from existing customers and new customers in other areas of our prepaid card operations, could reduce growth of our deposits and non-interest income and, possibly, limit our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms. The Bank provided the FDIC and the Delaware State Bank Commissioner with the required BSA Report as of December 31, 2019 and it is now under review by the regulators.\n\ufeff\nOn August 27, 2015, the Bank entered into an Amendment to Consent Order, or the 2014 Consent Order Amendment, with the FDIC, amending the 2014 Consent Order. The Bank took this action without admitting or denying any additional charges of unsafe or unsound banking practices or violations of law or regulation relating to continued weaknesses in the Bank's BSA compliance program. The 2014 Consent Order Amendment provides that the Bank shall not declare or pay any dividend without the prior written consent of the FDIC and for certain assurances regarding management.\n\ufeff\nOn May 11, 2015, the Federal Reserve issued a letter, or the Supervisory Letter, to us as a result of the 2014 Consent Order and the 2014 Consent Order Amendment (which, at the time of the Supervisory Letter, was in proposed form), which provides that we shall not pay any dividends on our common stock or make any interest payments on our trust preferred securities, without the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve. It further provides that we may not incur any debt (excluding payables in the ordinary course of business) or redeem any shares of our stock, without the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve. The requirement for such approval was lifted by the Federal Reserve in the fourth quarter of 2019, and the Supervisory Letter was terminated at that time.\n\ufeff\nOn December 23, 2015, the Bank entered into a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of an Amended Consent Order, Order for Restitution, and Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty with the FDIC, which we refer to as the 2015 Consent Order. The Bank took this action without admitting or denying any charges of violations of law or regulation. The 2015 Consent Order amended and restated in its entirety the terms of the 2012 Consent Order.\n\ufeff\nThe 2015 Consent Order was based on FDIC allegations regarding electronic fund transfer, or EFT, error resolution practices, account termination practices and fee practices of various third parties with whom the Bank had previously provided, or currently provides, deposit-related products whom we refer to as Third Parties. The 2015 Consent Order continues the Bank's obligations\noriginally set forth in the 2012 Consent Order, including its obligations to increase board oversight of the Bank's compliance management system, or CMS, improve the Bank's CMS, enhance its internal audit program, increase its management and oversight of Third Parties, and correct any apparent violations of law.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to restating the general terms of the 2012 Consent Order, the 2015 Consent Order directs the Bank's Board of Directors to establish a Complaint and Error Claim Oversight and Review Committee, which we refer to as the Complaint and Error Claim Committee to review and oversee the Bank's processes and practices for handling, monitoring and resolving consumer complaints and EFT error claims (whether received directly or through Third Parties) and to review management's plans for correcting any weaknesses that may be found in such processes and practices. The Bank's Board of Directors appointed the required Complaint and Error Claim Committee on January 29, 2016.\n\ufeff\nThe 2015 Consent Order also requires the Bank to implement a corrective action plan, or CAP, to remediate and provide restitution to those prepaid cardholders who asserted or attempted to assert, or were discouraged from initiating EFT error claims, and to provide restitution to cardholders harmed by EFT error resolution practices. The 2015 Consent Order requires that if, through the CAP, the Bank identifies prepaid cardholders who have been adversely affected by a denial or failure to resolve an EFT error claim, the Bank will ensure that monetary restitution is made. The Bank completed its implementation of the CAP on January 15, 2020. As of the completion date, $1,592,469.20 of restitution was paid to consumers of which $4,352.61 was paid by the Bank and the remaining amount by Third Parties.\n\ufeff\nThe 2015 Consent Order also imposed a $3 million civil money penalty on the Bank, which the Bank has paid and which was recognized as expense in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nOn March 7, 2018, the Bank entered into a Stipulation and Consent to Order for Restitution and Order To Pay Civil Money Penalty with the FDIC, which we refer to as the 2018 Restitution Order and 2018 CMP Order, respectively. The Bank took this action without admitting or denying any alleged violations of law or regulation. The FDIC's action principally emanated from one of the Bank's third-party payment processors ( Third-Party Processor\u201d) that suffered an internal system programming glitch. This inadvertently resulted in consumers that engaged in signature-based point of sale transactions during the period from December 2010 to November 2014 being charged a greater fee than what was disclosed by the Bank. The FDIC alleged the Bank's incorrect fee imposition due to the Third-Party Processor error was an unfair or deceptive act or practice and violated Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The 2018 CMP Order imposed a $2 million civil money penalty on the Bank which the Bank has paid, and was recognized as expense on September 30, 2017.\nThe 2018 Restitution Order required the Bank to develop a written Restitution Plan, subject to independent audit and FDIC non-objection, to ensure impacted consumers are compensated for any incorrectly charged fees. The 2018 Restitution Order required the Bank to make such reimbursements if not otherwise made by the Third-Party Processor and the Bank is indemnified by the Third-Party Processor for such reimbursements. Impacted consumers were reimbursed by the Third-Party Processor at its own expense. The civil money penalty was not subject to any indemnification or recovery from any third party. On December 19, 2019, the FDIC concluded the Bank had fully complied with the 2018 Restitution Order and issued an order terminating the 2018 Restitution Order.\nOn December 18, 2019, the Bank's Board of Directors, without admitting or denying any violations of law, regulation or the provisions of the 2014 Consent Order, executed a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of an Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty in the amount of $7.5 million based on supervisory findings during the period of 2013 to 2019 related principally to deficiencies in the Bank's legacy Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) Programs and alleged violations of law during the period, as well as the length of time the Bank has taken to fully implement the corrective actions required by the 2014 Consent Order. The Bank paid this amount, and it was recognized as an expense in the Company's financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nResults of Operations\nOverview: Net interest income continued its upward trend in 2019, increasing $20.4 million over the prior year, primarily as a result of higher balances of commercial loans originated for sale. Net interest income also benefited from increases in other loan categories. From year end 2018 to year end 2019, SBLOC and IBLOC, SBA and leasing balances grew 30%, 22% and 10%, respectively. Net interest income also reflected higher yields resulting from the Federal Reserve's 2018 interest rate increases, the impact of which was partially offset by Federal Reserve rate reductions in latter 2019. While our loans generally adjust more fully to Federal Reserve interest rate changes, funding costs generally adjust to only a portion of such rate changes. For 2019, funding costs were 22 basis points higher than 2018 compared to a 32 basis point increase in yield on interest earning assets. Reflecting the above\nfactors, net interest income increased by $20.4 million or 16.9% in 2019 compared to the prior year. The provision for loan and lease losses increased $815,000 to $4.4 million in 2019 as decreases in provisions for small business loans and leasing were more than offset by a $1.0 million provision for other consumer loans. Non-interest income in 2019 decreased by $49.7 million. That decrease reflected a $65.0 million gain on sale of the SHIRA portfolio in 2018 which was partially offset by an increase of $10.5 million in prepaid, debit card and related fees in 2019.\n\ufeff\nIn 2019, total non-interest expense increased $17.2 million to $168.5 million, reflecting a $14.4 million increase in salaries and employee benefits and $8.9 million in civil money penalties which were partially offset by decreases of $2.5 million in legal fees, $1.8 million in FDIC insurance expense and $1.3 million in data processing expense.\n\ufeff\nIn 2017, income tax expense was impacted by legislation reducing federal corporate income tax rates. As a result, deferred tax assets were adjusted to the new rates, decreasing the value of those assets and increasing tax expense in that year. The lower 21% federal corporate tax rate was effective for 2018 and 2019.\n\ufeff\nIn 2014, the Bank discontinued its regional Philadelphia commercial loan division to focus on its aforementioned national specialty lending lines of business. At year end 2019, our net discontinued assets amounted to $140.7 million compared to $197.8 million at year end 2018. Net commercial discontinued loans included in those totals were, respectively, $70.6 million and $118.1 million. These loans consisted primarily of loans secured by commercial real estate including construction and land loans. As these balances are reduced, either through sales or repayment, we plan to invest the proceeds into our continuing lending lines. Efforts to sell or otherwise dispose of these loans continue and if not sold, the loans will be retained. We also retain the financing receivable of $39.2 million from the 2014 Walnut Street securitization. See Note W to the financial statements. That entity is also primarily comprised of discontinued commercial real estate loans, including construction and land loans or real estate collateral resulting from the default of such loans.\nAt December 31, 2019, our total loans amounted to $1.82 billion, an increase of $322.3 million, or 21.5%, over the $1.50 billion balance at December 31, 2018, reflecting growth in all major categories of loans. Our investment securities available-for-sale increased $84.4 million to $1.32 billion from $1.24 billion between those respective dates as reinvestments were accelerated when long term rates increased.\nNet Income: 2019 compared to 2018. Net income from continuing operations was $51.3 million in 2019 compared to $87.5 million in 2018 while income before taxes was, respectively, $72.5 million and $119.8 million, a decrease of $47.3 million. In 2019, net interest income grew by $20.4 million and non-interest income decreased $49.7 million. The $20.4 million, or 16.9%, increase in 2019 net interest income over 2018 resulted primarily from higher balances of commercial loans originated for sale. Net interest income also benefited from increases in other loan categories. From year end 2018 to year end 2019, SBLOC and IBLOC, SBA and leasing balances grew 30%, 22% and 10%, respectively. The $49.7 million decrease in non-interest income reflected a $65.0 million gain on sale of the SHIRA portfolio in 2018 and a $10.5 million increase in prepaid, debit card and related fees in 2019.\n\ufeff\nIn 2019 compared to 2018, the primary drivers of fee income, prepaid, debit and related fees and fees on ACH, card and other payment processing fees, increased 17.8% to $74.5 million. Gain on sale of loans increased $3.6 million to $24.1 million which resulted primarily from a higher volume of loans sold into securitizations in 2019. Additionally, in 2018, $3.7 million of charges resulted from the investment in unconsolidated entity while we had no such charges in 2019. That investment resulted from the sale of certain discontinued loans into a securitization in 2014. See Note W to the financial statements. In 2019, total non-interest expense increased $17.2 million to $168.5 million, reflecting a $14.4 increase in salaries and employee benefits and $8.9 million in civil money penalties which were partially offset by decreases of $2.5 million in legal fees, $1.8 million in FDIC expense and $1.3 million in data processing expense. Salary and benefits expense increased by $14.4 million reflecting higher incentive compensation for loan, deposit and fee production and higher information technology and loan and payments infrastructure expense. In 2019, non-interest expense included $8.9 million of expense for a $1.4 million SEC civil money penalty and a $7.5 million FDIC civil money penalty. FDIC insurance expense decreased $1.8 million in 2019, primarily as a result of a decrease in the insurance rate applicable to the Bank.\n\ufeff\nIn 2017, income tax expense was impacted by legislation reducing federal corporate income tax rates. As a result, deferred tax assets were adjusted to the new rates, decreasing the value of those assets and increasing tax expense in that year. The lower 21% federal corporate tax rate was effective for 2018 and 2019. The combined federal and state income tax rate was 29% in 2019. It was higher than the 27% rate in 2018 primarily as a result of the non-deductibility of $8.9 million of civil penalties in 2019.\n\ufeff\nReflecting these changes, net income from continuing operations amounted to $51.3 million in 2019 compared to $87.5 million in 2018, or continuing operations earnings per diluted share of $0.89 compared to $1.53 in 2018. Net income from discontinued operations was $291,000 for 2019 compared to $1.1 million for 2018. Including discontinued operations, diluted income per share was $0.90 for 2019 compared to $1.55 for 2018 on net income of $51.6 million and $88.7 million, respectively.\n\ufeff\nNet Income: 2018 compared to 2017. Net income from continuing operations was $87.5 million in 2018 compared to $17.3 million in 2017 while income before taxes was, respectively, $119.8 million and $40.4 million, an increase of $79.4 million. In 2018, net interest income grew by $14.2 million and non-interest income increased $62.2 million which accounted for the majority of the increase. The $14.2 million, or 13.3%, increase in 2018 net interest income over 2017 resulted primarily from loan growth and higher yields, reflecting Federal Reserve rate increases. From year end 2017 to year end 2018, SBLOC, SBA and leasing balances grew 8%, 17% and 5%, respectively. The $62.2 million increase in non-interest income reflected a $65.0 million gain on sale of the SHIRA portfolio and a $3.2 million reduction in service fees on deposit accounts related to that portfolio.\n\ufeff\nIn 2018 compared to 2017, the primary drivers of fee income, prepaid and debit card fees and fees on ACH, card and other payment processing fees, increased 6.0% to $63.3 million. Gain on sale of loans increased $2.6 million to $20.5 million which resulted primarily from a higher volume of loans sold into securitizations in 2018. Additionally, in 2018, $3.7 million of charges resulted from the investment in unconsolidated entity while such charges in 2017 were $20,000. That investment resulted from the sale of certain discontinued loans into a securitization in 2014. See Note W to the financial statements. In 2018, total non-interest expense decreased $3.6 million to $151.3 million, reflecting a $4.0 million reduction in data processing expense resulting from a renegotiated contract and reduced transaction volume resulting from the planned exit of an affinity group which had changed ownership. Salary and benefits expense increased by $4.0 million reflecting higher BSA and compliance expenses and higher incentive compensation expense. In 2017, non-interest expense included $2.3 million of expense for an FDIC civil money penalty. FDIC insurance expense decreased $1.3 million in 2018, primarily as a result of a decrease in the insurance rate applicable to the Bank.\n\ufeff\nIn 2017, income tax expense was impacted by legislation reducing federal corporate income tax rates. As a result, deferred tax assets were adjusted to the new rates, decreasing the value of those assets and increasing tax expense in that year. The lower 21% corporate tax rate was effective for 2018 and the combined federal and state income tax rate in 2018 was 27%.\n\ufeff\nReflecting these changes, net income from continuing operations amounted to $87.5 million in 2018 compared to $17.3 million in 2017, or continuing operations income per diluted share of $1.53 compared to $0.31 in 2017. Net income from discontinued operations was $1.1 million for 2018 compared to $4.3 million for 2017. Including discontinued operations, diluted income per share was $1.55 for 2018 compared to $0.39 for 2017 on net income of $88.7 million and $21.7 million, respectively.\n\ufeff\nNet Interest Income: 2019 compared to 2018. Our net interest income for 2019 increased to $141.3 million, an increase of $20.4 million, or 16.9%, from $120.8 million for 2018, reflecting a $31.6 million, or 21.4%, increase in interest income to $179.6 million from $148.0 million for 2018. The increase in net interest income primarily reflected the impact of higher balances of commercial real estate loans held for sale and other loan growth and higher loan yields resulting from Federal Reserve rate increases in 2018. The impact of the prior year rate increases was partially offset by Federal Reserve rate decreases in the latter part of 2019. Our average loans and leases increased 24.9% to $2.42 billion in 2019 from $1.94 billion for 2018, while related interest income increased $31.8 million on a tax equivalent basis. The largest increases in average loans and leases and related interest income was in commercial loans originated for sale, which respectively increased $300.2 million and $17.6 million. Small business loan, SBLOC and IBLOC and leasing interest income respectively increased $6.3 million, $6.1 million and $2.4 million. Our average investment securities were $1.41 billion for 2019 compared to $1.38 billion for 2018, while related interest income increased $245,000 on a tax equivalent basis.\nOur net interest margin (calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest earning assets) for 2019 increased 13 basis points to 3.32% from 3.19% for 2018. The increase reflected higher yields on variable rate loans resulting from the aforementioned Federal Reserve increases, partially offset by decreased yields on taxable investment securities. While the yield on loans increased to 5.25% from 4.92%, the yield on taxable investment securities decreased to 3.01% from 3.05%. The decrease reflected higher premium amortization resulting from prepayments. The average yield on our interest earning assets increased to 4.18% from 3.86% for 2018, an increase of 32 basis points, while the cost of total deposits and interest bearing liabilities increased to 0.92% for 2019 from 0.70% for 2018, an increase of 22 basis points. While variable rate loans and securities adjusted more fully to Federal Reserve rate changes, deposits adjusted only partially to the Federal Reserve changes. In 2019, average demand and interest checking deposits amounted to $3.82 billion, compared to $3.50 billion in 2018, an increase of 9.1%. The yield on those deposits increased to 0.80% in 2019 compared to 0.66% in 2018. Savings and money market balances averaged $37.7 million in 2019\ncompared to $362.3 million in 2018 with an average 0.48% rate in 2019 compared to 0.79% in 2018. The decrease reflected the SHIRA sale.\nNet Interest Income: 2018 compared to"}
