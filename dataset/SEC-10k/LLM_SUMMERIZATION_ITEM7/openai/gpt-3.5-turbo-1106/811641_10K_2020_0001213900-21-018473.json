Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. One should review Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report for a discussion of some of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results, objectives or expectations described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNet cash provided by operating activities improved to $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 in comparison to $234,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash paid for capital expenditures was $4.1 million and $1.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our total depreciation expense was approximately $2.3 million and $2.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We anticipate that depreciation expense, while not affecting our cash flows from operations, will result in net operating losses until and unless product sales increase sufficiently to offset these non-cash expenses. Going forward, repayments of the indebtedness incurred to fund these capital expenditures and acquire these assets will reduce our cash flows. Debt principal payments (exclusive of the $8.3 million used to repay our refinanced bank debt during the first quarter of 2020 and $624,000 used to pay down our mortgage loan during the fourth quarter of 2020) were $633,000 and $861,000 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We are obligated to make principal repayments of approximately $768,000, $818,000 and $916,000 under these loans during the years ending December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.\nImmuCell Corporation\nBased on our best estimates and projections, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, together with gross margin anticipated to be earned from ongoing product sales, will be sufficient to meet our most urgent working capital and capital expenditure requirements and to finance our ongoing business operations for at least twelve months (which is the period of time required to be addressed for such purposes by accounting disclosure standards) from the date of this filing. We have funded most of our business operations principally from the gross margin on our product sales and equity and debt financings. The table below summarizes the changes in selected, key accounts (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Decrease) Increase </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,946 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(828 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net working capital </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,946 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,694 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(748 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,692 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stockholders' equity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(725 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Common shares outstanding(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 16: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>There were approximately 414,000 and 389,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance for stock options that were outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFrom the first quarter of 2016 through the first quarter of 2019, we raised gross proceeds of approximately $22.5 million (net proceeds were approximately $20.5 million) from five different common equity transactions priced between $5.25 and $7.30 per share. No warrants were issued in connection with any of these transactions, and no convertible or preferred securities were issued.\nFrom 2010 to 2017, we secured five different debt financings with TDBank N.A., each with different maturity dates and balloon principal repayment obligations. During the first quarter of 2020, we closed on a debt refinancing aggregating $8.6 million plus a line of credit in the amount of $1.0 million with Gorham Savings Bank (GSB). This new debt was comprised of a $5.1 million mortgage loan that bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.50% per annum (with a 10-year term and 25-year amortization schedule) and a $3.5 million note that bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.50% per annum (with a 7-year term and amortization schedule). The refinancing proceeds were used to provide some additional working capital, but mostly to refinance $8.3 million of then outstanding bank debt and pay off an interest rate swap termination liability of $165,000. This debt refinancing improved our liquidity by lowering our interest expense, spreading our principal payments out over a longer time period and eliminating pending balloon principal payments that existed under some of the repaid debt. We were required to hold $1.4 million in escrow (a non-current asset), which reduced the effective availability of our liquid assets for operational needs by that amount. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we closed on a $1.5 million note with GSB that bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.5% per annum (with a 7-year term and amortization schedule). We used $624,000 of the proceeds to prepay a portion of the then outstanding principal on our mortgage loan, which reduced the then outstanding balance to 80% of the most recent appraised value of the property securing the debt, which allowed GSB to release the $1.4 million of funds held in escrow. These credit facilities are subject to certain restrictions and financial covenants and are secured by substantially all of our assets, including our facility at 56 Evergreen Drive in Portland (which was independently appraised at $4.2 million in connection with the 2015 financing and at $3 million in connection with the 2020 refinancing) and our facility at 33 Caddie Lane in Portland (which was independently appraised at $3.2 million in connection with the 2017 financing and at $2.5 million in connection with the 2020 refinancing).We are required to meet a minimum debt service coverage ratio set by GSB of 1.35. Our actual debt service coverage ratio was equal to 2.03 and 1.57 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. However, based on current projections of our future financial performance, which includes a high level of ongoing product development expenses to support Re-Tain\u2122, we may not satisfy this annual requirement for the year ending December 31, 2021. We are negotiating an acceptable solution with GSB.\nDuring June 2020, we received a $500,000 loan from the Maine Technology Institute that is subordinated to all other bank debt. The first 27 months of this loan are interest-free with no interest accrual or required principal payments. Principal and interest payments at a fixed rate of 5% per annum are due quarterly over the final five years of the loan, beginning during the fourth quarter of 2022 and continuing through the third quarter of 2027. The loan may be prepaid without penalty at any time.\nImmuCell Corporation\nOur capital expenditures during the seven-year period from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2020 are described in the following table:\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Cash Paid During the Years Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>B </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>C </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>D </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>E </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,512 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>265 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,719 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,093 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,586 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,760 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>434 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,030 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>574 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,391 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,938 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>581 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,073 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,640 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,071 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPROJECT A (which was completed during 2016) included a 7,100 square foot facility addition at 56 Evergreen Drive and related equipment and cold storage capacity to increase the production capacity for the First Defense\u00ae product line. During the first quarter of 2016, we completed this investment, increasing our freeze drying capacity by 100% and making other improvements to our liquid processing capacity, which increased our annual production capacity (in terms of annual sales dollars) to approximately $16.5 million. The actual value of this production output varies based on production yields, selling price, product format mix and other factors. This investment also included the construction and equipping of a pilot plant for small-scale Drug Substance production facility for Re-Tain\u2122 within our First Defense\u00ae production facility at 56 Evergreen. Since Project B was completed, this space has been used to produce the gel tube formats of the First Defense\u00ae product line. One of the objectives of Project C is to move the gel tube operations to 175 Industrial Way so that the vacated space can be used to double our liquid processing capacity at 56 Evergreen Drive. \t\nPROJECT B (which was completed during 2018) was related to the Drug Substance production facility for Re-Tain\u2122 at 33 Caddie Lane. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed construction of the Drug Substance production facility. We began equipment installation during the third quarter of 2017, and we completed this installation during the third quarter of 2018. The total cost of this investment for the Drug Substance production facility and related processing equipment was $20.8 million plus $331,000 for the land and $472,000 for the acquisition of an adjacent 4,100 square foot warehouse facility, which is now being used for First Defense\u00ae operations.\t\nPROJECT C (which we anticipate completing during the second quarter of 2021) consists of significant renovations to a 14,300 square foot leased facility at 175 Industrial Way, some facility modifications at 56 Evergreen Drive and the necessary production equipment to increase the annual production capacity of the First Defense\u00ae product line (in terms of annual sales dollars) from approximately $16.5 million to approximately $23 million. These production capacity projections differ moderately from prior estimates largely because of biological yield differences and changes in the product format mix. The actual value of our production output varies based on production yields, selling price, product format mix and other factors. This expansion involves a 50% increase in our freeze drying capacity and a 100% increase in our liquid processing capacity. Renovations to our leased facility at 175 Industrial Way to enable this expansion were completed during the second quarter of 2020. A site license approval for this new facility was issued by the USDA during the third quarter of 2020. By moving our powder filling and assembly services from 56 Evergreen Drive into this new space at 175 Industrial Way, we created space at 56 Evergreen Drive for the installation of the expanded freeze drying capacity. We completed that installation during the first quarter of 2021. Presently, we are completing the relocation of our gel formulation equipment from 56 Evergreen Drive to 175 Industrial Way, creating space for the doubling of our liquid processing capacity at 56 Evergreen Drive. We deferred the implementation of this final phase of the expansion project to the second quarter of 2021 in order not to disrupt finished product releases during our peak selling season. Equipment modifications and relocations of this nature require a shut down of operations for several weeks to validate the modified equipment and achieve USDA approval for its use in its new location. Since this investment was initiated during 2019 and through December 31, 2020, we paid approximately $3.2 million towards Project C, leaving an investment of approximately $300,000 to complete the investment during the second quarter of 2021. As part of this $3.5 million investment, we also have made the facility modifications necessary for a future expansion of our freeze drying capacity by an additional 33%, which would increase our annual production capacity from approximately $23 million to approximately $30 million. The equipment required to achieve this further production capacity increase would cost approximately an additional $800,000. We anticipate bringing this further expanded production capacity on-line during the second half of 2022 to meet projected growth in sales demand.\nImmuCell Corporation\nPROJECT D (construction of which we anticipate completing by the end of 2022) is a $4 million budgeted investment to bring the formulation and aseptic filling services for Re-Tain\u2122 Drug Product in-house to end our reliance on third-party Drug Product manufacturing services. We expect this facility to be operational during 2022. Since this investment was initiated during 2019 and through December 31, 2020, we have expended approximately $1.1 million towards Project D, leaving an investment of approximately $2.9 million to complete the project during 2021 and 2022.\t\nPROJECT E represents other miscellaneous, routine and necessary capital investments and replacements during the years. The original budget for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $300,000 was increased to $450,000. The budget for 2021 and 2022 is $550,000 per year.\nWe have set aside approximately $4.3 million of the $7.9 million of the cash we had on hand as of December 31, 2020 to complete the investments in Projects C and D and to fund Project E for 2021 and 2022. We plan to complete our $3.5 million investment to increase our production capacity so that we can fill the backlog of orders, meet ongoing demand and use any excess production to build inventory stocks by the end of 2021. This will also require that we invest some available cash in inventory. Our inventory balances were $2.1 million and $2.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our inventory balances consisted of approximately 1% and 21% finished goods as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 5 to the accompanying audited financial statements for more details about our inventory.\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, the City of Portland approved a Tax Increment Financing (TIF) credit enhancement package that reduces the real estate taxes on our Drug Substance production facility for Re-Tain\u2122 by 65% over the eleven-year period beginning on July 1, 2017 and ending June 30, 2028 and by 30% during the year ending June 30, 2029, at which time the rebate expires. During the second quarter of 2017, the TIF was approved by the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development. The value of the tax savings will increase (decrease) in proportion to any increase (decrease) in the assessment of the building for city real estate tax purposes. The following table discloses how much of the new taxes we have generated is being relieved by the TIF and how much is being paid by ImmuCell:\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td>Assessed Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve-Month\nPeriod Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total New\nTaxes\nGenerated\nby the Project </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less:\nTIF Credit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Amount\nPaid by\nImmuCell </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>1.7M @ April 1, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>4.0M @ April 1, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>4.0M @ April 1, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>4.0M @ April 1, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nProduct Sales\nTotal product sales during the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 12%, or $1.6 million, to $15.3 million from $13.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, with domestic sales increasing by 12% and international sales increasing by 11% in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2019. International sales aggregated 11% of total sales during both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The compound annual growth rate of our total product sales during the ten years ended December 31, 2020 was approximately 13%. The compound annual growth rate of our total product sales during the three years ended December 31, 2020 was approximately 18%. Sales achieved during 2020 were the equivalent of approximately 93% of the $16.5 million that we estimate to be our current annual production capacity. As of December 31, 2020, we had depleted our available finished goods inventory and had a backlog of orders worth approximately $1.8 million, compared to backlogs of approximately $130,000, $945,000, $1.4 million and $0 as of September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. If we had been able to ship the backlog of orders before December 31, 2020, our total sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have reached approximately $17.2 million. This pro-forma calculation indicates the current annual demand for our product and demonstrates the need for us to increase our annual production capacity over the current level of approximately $16.5 million (Project C, discussed above). While this is a very positive indication about the strong demand for our First Defense\u00ae product line, not being able to meet the needs of our customers presently could result in the loss of some customers that seek alternative scours management products during this period of short supply and may not resume purchasing our product when we have eliminated the backlog. We are missing some business during the peak season of 2021. As a result of this short supply, we anticipate that our sales during the three-month period ending March 31, 2021 will be approximately 16% lower than the sales recorded during the three-month period ended March 31, 2020. The projected sales for the first quarter of 2021 represent the equivalent of approximately 100% of the $4.1 million that we estimate to be our current quarterly production capacity. As our product mix shifts in favor of Tri-Shield First Defense\u00ae, it has become more difficult to achieve or exceed this estimated production capacity. After our increased production capacity comes on-line during the second quarter of 2021, and assuming we sell and produce to plan, we expect sales for the year ending December 31, 2021 to be greater than sales recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020. A precise estimation of the amount of the recovery from the first quarter sales drop to the anticipated year-over-year sales increase is very difficult to make, given the uncertainties related to the impacts of new business opportunities missed due to COVID-related restrictions and customers lost (that may be or may not return at or above prior levels of purchasing) and other factors experienced during the period of order backlog.\nImmuCell Corporation\nInvestments in the First Defense\u00ae product line have created positive results. Sales of the First Defense\u00ae product line increased by 14% during the year ended December 31, 2020 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2019, aggregating 98% and 97% of our total product sales during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Most of our growth is being realized through increased demand and a deliberate strategy to bias limited production capacity towards Tri-Shield\u00ae (the trivalent format of our product delivered via a gel tube), which provides broader protection to calves.\nStarting in the third quarter of 2016 and through most of 2017, we had sufficient available inventory and were shipping in accordance with the demand of our distributors. However, we quickly sold out of our initial launch quantities of Tri-Shield First Defense\u00ae soon after regulatory approval was obtained during the fourth quarter of 2017. During most of 2018 and into the first half of 2019, we could only accept purchase orders from customers for Tri-Shield\u00ae to match available inventory, which required a careful allocation of product supply directly to certain end-users and veterinary clinics. Initially, production of this new product format did not keep pace with demand primarily because of our inability to produce enough of the new, complex rotavirus vaccine that is used to immunize our source cows. Work on production improvements in our vaccine laboratory throughout 2018 led to significant improvements in vaccine yield and process repeatability resolving this Tri-Shield\u00ae shortfall going into 2019. Allowing for the five to six month production cycle from the manufacture of our proprietary vaccine to the production of a finished dose, we were able to return to a mass market selling approach through distribution for Tri-Shield\u00ae during the second half of 2019. We ended the year with no backlog of orders for the First Defense\u00ae product line as of December, 31 2019. Our current production output was not enough to meet increasing demand for the First Defense\u00ae product line during 2020, and, as noted above, we ended the year with a backlog of orders worth approximately $1.8 million as of December 31, 2020. We expect to fully realize the benefits of our expanded production capacity beginning during the second quarter of 2021.\nValuation of the backlog is a non-GAAP estimate that is based on purchase orders on hand at the time that could not be met because of lack of available inventory. While we are confident that our customers would have accepted and paid for this product if it had been available to ship, we do allow customers to cancel orders, in whole or in part, to meet their current needs as time goes by. This is happening during the first quarter of 2021 and may continue to happen as we work to clear the backlog during the second quarter of 2021. Therefore, the measurement of the backlog amount is no longer a consistent indication of the amount of unmet demand for our product. As the increased production capacity comes online during the second quarter of 2021, we expect to fulfill the remaining backlog and meet ongoing strong demand. This would allow us to build inventory during the second half of 2021and return to a growth mode, as we prepare for peak season sales during the first quarter of 2022 without risk of backlog.\nWe are gaining market share in the United States year after year with our Beyond Vaccination\u00ae strategy. Our share of the market (on a unit volume basis) of scour preventative products administered at the calf-level increased to approximately 41% during 2020 (from 36% during 2019, 34% during 2018 and 32% during 2017). Our share of the market of calves treated with products administered to calves and those administered to the dam prior to calving (adjusting for two doses of dam-level scour vaccines required for primary vaccination of first-calf-heifers) increased to approximately 13% during 2020 (from 11% during 2019, 10.3% during 2018 and 9.7% during 2017). We see the potential for future market share growth in the dairy market, and we have increased our focus on the beef market.\nImmuCell Corporation\nEffective January 1, 2019, we implemented a 2% price increase for Dual-Force\u00ae. Effective February 1, 2020, we implemented a price increase of approximately 2% on the First Defense\u00ae product line (except for Tri-Shield\u00ae and the 90-dose bulk powder format) and CMT. Effective January 1, 2021, we increased our selling price of the First Defense\u00ae product line in the domestic market by approximately 1.6% to 3%, depending on product format, and we increased our selling price of CMT by almost 4%.\nSales of products other than the First Defense\u00ae product line decreased by 44%, or $209,000, to $270,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2019. Sales of these other products aggregated approximately 2% and 3% of our total product sales during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We sell our own CMT (our second leading source of product sales during 2020 and our third leading source of product sales during 2019) which is used to detect somatic cell counts in milk. We acquired a private label product (our third leading source of product sales during 2020 and our second leading source of product sales during 2019) in connection with our January 2016 acquisition of certain gel formulation technology. We have made and sold bulk reagents for Isolate\u2122 (our fourth leading source of product sales during 2019), which is a drinking water test that is sold by our former distributor in the United Kingdom. We made one final sale of this product to this distributor worth $134,000 during the first quarter of 2019. Because this product was non-core to our strategic focus, we sold the underlying cell line assets and intellectual property to our former distributor during the third quarter of 2018 for $700,000. We have retained the rights to all animal health, diagnostic, feed and nutritional applications of this technology.\nThe extent of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economics of our customers and on the demand for our products going forward is very difficult to assess. The Class III milk price (measured in dollars per 100 pounds) averaged $18.16 during the year ended December 31, 2020, but this price has been extremely volatile during the pandemic. For example, the price increased by 102% from a low of $12.14 during May 2020 to a recent high of $24.54 during July, which is very close to an all-time record high of $24.60 during September 2014. Initially, stay at home orders disrupted the food service supply system as schools closed and restaurants were shut down. In response, producers were forced to reduce the supply of milk to the market by drying off cows early, culling cows from the herd and dumping milk, among other tactics. Market conditions are better now, but this volatility remains a concern, and there is no way to be confident that these recent high milk prices will be sustained. The $938,000 in funding that we received from the federal government through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) under the CARES Act helped us maintain full employment without furloughs or layoffs and continue executing our growth plans, even though we may see a future decline in sales and gross margin as a result of the pandemic. The PPP funding created some needed financial liquidity allowing us to move forward with our investments even though we did not achieve the level of sales anticipated in our 2020 budget. After making several inquiries into different laboratories, we were able to have our antibodies tested for effectiveness against COVID-19 during the second quarter of 2020. While we understood that COVID-19 and bovine coronavirus are in different taxonomic groups, we wanted to investigate whether our antibodies could offer some cross-neutralization of COVID-19 in the laboratory testing. Unfortunately, the test results indicated, as expected, that our antibodies offered no viral neutralization activity, meaning they would be ineffective against COVID-19.\nImmuCell Corporation\nGross Margin\nChanges in our gross margin (product sales less costs of goods sold) are summarized in the following table for the respective periods (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>During the Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross margin </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,863 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Percent of product sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe gross margin as a percentage of product sales was 45%, 49%, 47% and 50% during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The gross margin as a percentage of sales during 2020 was lower than what we normally expect, but we did increase the gross margin dollars over prior year. The gross margin percentage for the legacy format (capsule) of the First Defense\u00ae product line was in excess of 50%, which was in line with prior years. The Tri-Shield\u00ae product format is more complex (i.e. three antibodies versus two antibodies for Dual-Force\u00ae) and both the bivalent and trivalent gel product formats are more expensive to produce than the bolus format. These new formats are creating sales growth for us, and we are focused on increasing total gross margin dollars, even if that is accomplished with a lower gross margin as a percentage of sales. Throughout 2020, we invested significantly in equipment, infrastructure and operating expenses to increase our annual production capacity from approximately $16.5 million to approximately $23 million, but we were not able to spread the full benefit of those costs over higher production output because the increased capacity will not be on-line until the second quarter of 2021. We have estimated that this impact drove our gross margin down by a little more than a percentage point. A number of other factors contribute to the variability in our costs, resulting in some fluctuations in gross margin percentages from quarter to quarter and from year to year. Like most U.S. manufacturers, we have also been experiencing increases in the cost of labor and raw materials. We also invest to sustain compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) in our production processes. Increasing production can be more expensive in the initial stages. To achieve our inventory production growth objectives, we are acquiring more raw material (colostrum) from many more cows at many new farms. As is the case with any vaccine program, animals respond less effectively to their first exposure to a new vaccine and then the effectiveness of their immune response improves in response to subsequent immunizations. As a result, during this expansion phase, similar quantities of colostrum are yielding fewer doses of finished product, which results in higher costs of goods sold. Additionally, the biological yields from our raw material are always variable, which impacts our costs of goods sold in a similar way. Just as our customers' cows respond differently to commercial dam-level vaccines, depending on time of year and immune competency, our source cows have similar biological variances in response to our proprietary vaccines. The value of our First Defense\u00ae product line is that we compensate for the variability in a cow's immune response by standardizing each dose of finished product. This ensures that every calf is equally protected, which is something that dam-level commercial scours vaccines cannot offer. We continue to work on processing and yield improvements and other opportunities to reduce costs, while enhancing process knowledge and robustness. Over time, we have been able to reduce the impact of cost increases by implementing yield improvements. As we evaluate our product costs and selling price, it is one of our goals to continue to achieve a gross margin (before related depreciation and amortization expenses) as a percentage of total sales of almost 50%.\nProduct Development Expenses\nOverview: In accordance with our budget and plans, during the year ended December 31, 2020, product development expenses increased by 18%, or $667,000, to $4.4 million in comparison to $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Product development expenses aggregated 28% and 27% of product sales during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. It is important to note that these figures include approximately $1.6 million of non-cash depreciation and stock-based compensation expenses during both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We do expect our product development expenses to decrease after Re-Tain\u2122 is commercialized and most of the costs incurred to maintain and run our Drug Substance production facility become part of our costs of goods sold.\nExpenses pertaining to Re-Tain\u2122: The majority of our product development spending has been focused on the development of Re-Tain\u2122, our purified Nisin treatment for subclinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows. Approval by the Center for Veterinary Medicine, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the New Animal Drug Application (NADA) for Re-Tain\u2122 is required before any sales of the product can be initiated. The NADA is comprised of five principal Technical Sections and one administrative submission that are subject to phased review by the FDA. By statute, each Technical Section submission is generally subject to a six-month review cycle by the FDA. Each Technical Section can be reviewed and approved separately. Upon review and assessment by the FDA that all requirements for a Technical Section have been met, the FDA may issue a Technical Section Complete Letter. The current status of our work on these submissions to the FDA is as follows:\n1) Environmental Impact: During the third quarter of 2008, we received the Environmental Impact Technical Section Complete Letter from the FDA.\n2) Target Animal Safety: During the second quarter of 2012, we received the Target Animal Safety Technical Section Complete Letter from the FDA.\nImmuCell Corporation\n3) Effectiveness: During the third quarter of 2012, we received the Effectiveness Technical Section Complete Letter from the FDA. The draft product label carries claims for the treatment of subclinical mastitis associated with Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, and coagulase-negative staphylococci in lactating dairy cattle. In our pivotal effectiveness study, statistically significant cure rates were associated with a statistically significant reduction in milk somatic cell count, which is an important measure of milk quality.\n4) Human Food Safety: During the third quarter of 2018, we received the Human Food Safety Technical Section Complete Letter from the FDA confirming, among other things, a zero milk discard period and a zero meat withhold period during and after treatment with our product.\n5) Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC): Having previously achieved the four different Technical Section Complete Letters from the FDA discussed above, approval of the CMC Technical Section is the fifth and final significant step required before Re-Tain\u2122 product sales can be initiated in the United States. Implementing Nisin Drug Substance (the active pharmaceutical ingredient) production at our commercial facility, which is a required component of the CMC Technical Section, has been the most expensive and lengthy part of this project. We previously entered into an agreement with a multi-national pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturer for our commercial-scale supplies of Nisin. However, we determined during 2014 that the agreement did not offer us the most advantageous supply arrangement in terms of either cost or long-term dependability. We presented this product development opportunity to a variety of large and small animal health companies. While such a corporate partnership could have provided access to a much larger sales and marketing team and allowed us to avoid the large investment in a commercial-scale production facility, we concluded that a partner would have taken an unduly large share of the gross margin from all future product sales of Re-Tain\u2122. The regulatory and marketing feedback about the prospects for this product that we received from prospective partners, following their due diligence, was positive. During the third quarter of 2014, we completed an investment in facility modifications and processing equipment necessary to produce the Nisin Drug Substance at small-scale at our 56 Evergreen Drive facility. This small-scale facility was used to: i) expand our process knowledge and controls, ii) establish operating ranges for critical process parameters, iii) conduct product stability studies, iv) optimize process yields and v) verify the cost of production. We believe these efforts have reduced the risks associated with our investment in the commercial-scale Drug Substance production facility. Having raised equity during 2016 and 2017, we were able to move away from these earlier strategies and assume control over the commercial-scale manufacturing process in our own facility. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we acquired land near our existing Portland facility for the construction of a new commercial-scale Drug Substance production facility. We commenced construction of this facility during the third quarter of 2016 and completed construction during the fourth quarter of 2017. Equipment installation and qualification was initiated during the third quarter of 2017 and completed during the third quarter of 2018. Total construction and equipment costs aggregated approximately $20.8 million.\nWe have always believed that the fastest route to FDA approval and market launch is with the services of Norbrook Laboratories Limited of Newry, Northern Ireland (an FDA-approved Drug Product manufacturer), benefiting from their demonstrated expertise in aseptic filling. From 2010 to 2015, we had been a party to an exclusive product development and contract manufacturing agreement with Norbrook covering the Drug Product formulation, aseptic filling and final packaging services. Norbrook provided services to us under this contract throughout the FDA process for use in all of our pivotal studies. During the fourth quarter of 2015, this agreement was amended and restated to create a Product Development and Contract Manufacture Agreement (the 2015 Agreement) to, among other things, extend the term of the agreement to January 1, 2024 provided that FDA approval for commercial sales of Re-Tain\u2122 in the United States was obtained by December 19, 2019. It had been our expectation that we would have these services available through both the remainder of the development process to FDA approval and for approximately the first four years of commercial sales of Re-Tain\u2122. Due to unexpected difficulties and delays encountered by Norbrook and the statutory FDA timeline for processing CMC Technical Sections, this December 2019 product approval target date was not achieved. During the third quarter of 2019, we entered into a Development Services and Commercial Supply Agreement (the 2019 Agreement) with Norbrook. The 2019 Agreement replaced and superseded the 2015 Agreement in its entirety. Under the 2019 Agreement, Norbrook provided the formulation, aseptic filling and final packaging services as required in order for us to submit the CMC Technical Section to the FDA. The 2019 Agreement also provides for Norbrook to perform formulation, aseptic filling and final packaging services in accordance with purchase orders that we submit from time to time for inventory build and subsequent product sales worth up to approximately $7 million for orders placed through December 31, 2021 with deliveries extending into the first half of 2022. We believe that the 2019 Agreement will enable us to commence sales of Re-Tain\u2122 without delay upon receipt of the anticipated FDA approval. We intend to use the supply provided under the 2019 Agreement to bridge until our own formulation and aseptic filling capacity is available. We are in discussions with Norbrook about amending the 2019 agreement to cover some level of orders placed during 2022 in order to avoid potential interruptions in the supply of Re-Tain\u2122 following receipt of FDA approval and commencement of commercial sales.\nImmuCell Corporation\nOur potential alternative options for the formulation and aseptic filling services are narrowed considerably because our product cannot be formulated or filled in a facility that also processes traditional antibiotics (i.e., beta lactams). Consequently, we have decided to perform these services internally. Through a public offering of our common stock in March of 2019, we received net proceeds of approximately $8.3 million, of which approximately $4 million has been allocated to the equipping and commencement of operations of our own Drug Product formulation and aseptic filling facility. Based on current construction plans and equipment ordering and installation timelines, we expect our facility to be operational during the first half of 2022. We anticipate FDA approval of this facility during the fourth quarter of 2022 or the second quarter of 2023. This new facility will be subject to FDA inspection and approval and will have enough formulation and aseptic filling capacity to exceed the expected production capacity of our Drug Substance facility, which is at least $10 million in annual sales. This production capacity estimate is based on our assumptions as to product pricing and does not yet reflect inventory build strategies in advance of product approval or ongoing yield improvement initiatives. Establishing our own Drug Product formulation and aseptic filling capability provides us with the longer-term advantage of controlling the manufacturing process for Re-Tain\u2122 in one facility, thereby potentially reducing our manufacturing costs and eliminating international cold chain shipping logistics and costs. The Drug Product formulation and aseptic filling operation will be located in existing facility space that we had intended to utilize to double our Drug Substance production capacity if warranted by sales volumes following market launch. As a result, we would need to explore alternative strategies (in parallel with ongoing Drug Substance yield improvement initiatives) to expand our Drug Substance production capacity in order to meet anticipated long-term Re-Tain\u2122 sales demand. This integrated manufacturing capability for Re-Tain\u2122 will substantially reduce our dependence on third parties. Upon completion of our formulation and aseptic filling facility, the only significant third-party input for Re-Tain\u2122 will be the Drug Product syringes. It is anticipated that Hubert De Backer of Belgium (HDB) will supply these syringes in accordance with purchase orders that we submit. HDB is a syringe supplier for many of the largest participants in the human and veterinary medical industries, and with whom Norbrook presently works. Based on HDB's performance history and reputation in the industry, we are confident that HDB will be a dependable supplier of syringes in the quantity and of the quality needed for Re-Tain\u2122. We have not yet determined if we will perform the final packaging services in-house or contract to have those services performed by a qualified third party in the United States.\nThe Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Technical Section is very complex and comprehensive. Under the FDA's phased submission process, the first-phased submission covers the Nisin Drug Substance (DS), and the second-phased submission covers the DS and the Re-Tain\u2122 Drug Product (formulated DS filled in a syringe, or DP). This process allows a sponsor to respond to identified queries and/or deficiencies from the first-phased DS submission at the time of the second-phased DS and DP submission, which includes detailed information about the manufacturing process and controls for the DP. We made our first-phased DS submission during the first quarter of 2019. This submission included data from the DS Registration Batches produced at commercial scale in our new DS manufacturing facility. As part of the phased submission process, the FDA issued a Technical Section Incomplete Letter with regard to this first-phased DS submission during the third quarter of 2019 with various requests and queries in addition to referring to the fact that the second-phased DS and DP submission had yet to be submitted. We expected this response. In addition to responding to comments raised by the FDA regarding the first-phased DS submission, one of the key components of the second-phased DS and DP submission is demonstrating stability of the product over time using the commercial process and the commercial syringe in its final packaged form. We made the first submission of the second-phased DS and DP submission during the first quarter of 2021. A response from the FDA to this submission is anticipated during the third quarter of 2021 (six months after the submission date). This type of complex submission is often subject to two reviews by the FDA. We do not expect three submissions. If the FDA responds with a Technical Section Incomplete Letter, we would need time to prepare our response and then make one or more additional submissions (each subject to its own six-month review period) until the FDA is satisfied that we have adequately responded to their queries before the final 60-day administrative review period (the last step in the regulatory approval process) can be initiated. Assuming two reviews by the FDA, product approval would not be expected before the second quarter of 2022. Given the risk reduction we achieved by making the first-phased DS submission and by working with an FDA-approved DP manufacturer, it is possible that we could receive a first-time approval of the DS and DP submission during the third quarter of 2021, which could lead to FDA approval of our NADA during the fourth quarter of 2021. While being prudent with how much cash we invest into inventory that would have short expiry dating if market launch is not until the second quarter of 2022, we do intend to build some inventory during 2021 in preparation for the potential of an initial, limited market launch during the fourth quarter of 2021. We plan to continue to build more inventory during 2021 and 2022 to bridge the transition between DP supply from our contractor to our own in-house services. Our next objective is to prove the value of this new product concept as we develop a new product category. The road to commercial success for a new FDA-regulated product can be a long one for a small-cap company.\nImmuCell Corporation\nSuccessful FDA inspections of the manufacturing facilities must also be achieved before the NADA can be approved. During the third quarter of 2019, the FDA conducted a pre-approval inspection of our DS facility. This resulted in the issuance of certain deficiencies as identified on the FDA's Form 483. We submitted responses and data summaries in a phased manner over the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020. We anticipate a follow-up inspection by the FDA during the first half of 2021 to confirm the corrective actions that we have implemented. This inspection process has been managed without significant cost or impact on the timeline to product approval.\nOther product development initiatives: Our second most important product development initiative (in terms of dollars invested and, we believe, potential market impact) has been focused on other improvements, extensions or additions to our First Defense\u00ae product line. During the second quarter of 2009, we entered into an exclusive license with the Baylor College of Medicine covering the animal health rights to the underlying rotavirus vaccine technology that we use to generate the specific antibodies. This perpetual license (if not terminated for cause) was subject to royalty payments through December 31, 2019. We achieved product license approval and initiated market launch of this product, Tri-Shield First Defense\u00ae, during the fourth quarter of 2017. During the third quarter of 2018, we obtained approval from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) to sell Tri-Shield\u00ae in Canada. We initiated sales in Canada during the fourth quarter of 2019. We achieved USDA approval of our bivalent gel tube formulation (formerly marketed as First Defense Technology\u00ae) during the fourth quarter of 2018 and have re-branded this product format as Dual-Force First Defense\u00ae. During the first quarter of 2019, we obtained CFIA approval to sell the gel tube format of Dual-Force\u00ae in Canada and have initiated commercial sales there. We are currently working to establish USDA claims for our bivalent bulk powder formulation of First Defense Technology\u00ae. We are also investing in additional studies to further support the First Defense\u00ae product line in the market. At the same time, we are working to expand our product development pipeline of bacteriocins that can be used as alternatives to traditional antibiotics. Subject to the availability of resources, we intend to begin new development projects that are aligned with our core competencies and market focus. We also remain interested in acquiring, on suitable terms, other new products and technologies that fit with our sales focus on the dairy and beef industries.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, sales and marketing expenses decreased by approximately 6%, or $150,000, to $2.2 million in comparison to $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, amounting to 14% and 17% of product sales during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We were able to reduce selling expenses during 2020, but we do expect these expenses to increase to approximately 20% of total product sales during 2021 as we begin to invest in the anticipated market launch of Re-Tain\u2122 before any new sales are realized and as in-person marketing opportunities, such as industry events, return when COVID restrictions are eased. Our budgetary guideline for 2022 and after is to keep these expenses under 20% of total sales. This ratio is expected to come down incrementally as sales grow. Our sales team has pivoted effectively to alternative selling strategies and methods during the COVID-19 pandemic to be successful at a time when most trade shows have been cancelled and travel and on-farm visitations have been limited. The reduced travel and trade show expenses and having two open sales positions (during part of the year) resulted in some cost savings. We continue to leverage the efforts of our small sales force by using animal health distributors. Sales and marketing expenses included approximately $91,000 and $109,000 of non-cash depreciation and stock-based compensation expenses during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nImmuCell Corporation\nAdministrative Expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, administrative expenses increased by approximately 2%, or $33,000, to just over $1.7 million in comparison to just under $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Administrative expenses included approximately $156,000 and $208,000 of non-cash depreciation and stock-based compensation expenses during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Expenses during the first quarter of 2020 included fees paid to predecessor auditors, a new employee hiring fee and some extra legal work. We strive to be efficient with these expenses while funding costs associated with complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and all the legal, audit and other costs associated with being a publicly-held company. Prior to 2014, we had limited our investment in investor relations spending. Beginning in the second quarter of 2014, we initiated an investment in a more active investor relations program. Given travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, this initiative has pivoted to a virtual meeting format, which is less expensive. At the same time, we continue to provide full disclosure of the status of our business and financial condition in three quarterly reports and one annual report each year, as well as in Current Reports on Form 8-K when legally required or deemed appropriate by management. These efforts may have helped us access the capital markets to fund our growth objectives. Additional information about us is available in our annual Proxy Statement. All of these reports are filed with the SEC and are available on-line or upon request to the Company.\nNet Operating Loss\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, our net operating loss increased by 45%, or $426,000, to $1.4 million in comparison to $954,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. An increase of $667,000 in product development expenses (that was in line with our budgeted plans) was the largest contributor to this increase in our net operating loss.\nOther (Income) Expenses, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 other (income), net, aggregated ($348,000), which was in contrast to other expenses, net, of $314,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary cause of this change from expense to income was the recognition of $938,000 in debt forgiveness as other income, net, during the fourth quarter of 2020 from our Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan from the federal government received under the CARES Act. The $938,000 in PPP funding that we received during the second quarter of 2020 provided increased financial flexibility, strengthening our balance sheet with more liquidity and cash on hand, thereby enabling us to remain focused on our critical growth objectives and investments. The PPP funding has also given us the confidence to advance our $4 million investment to bring the formulation and aseptic filling services for Re-Tain\u2122 Drug Product in-house. This support has helped us avoid layoffs and furloughs thus far. Interest expense decreased to $413,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $432,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. Non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs was $103,000 and $17,000 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, amortization of debt issuance costs also included the write-off of $95,000 in debt issuance costs associated with our bank debt refinancing during the first quarter of 2020. Excluding the amortization and write-off of debt issuance costs, cash-based interest expense incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased to $310,000 from $415,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. Other income, net, during the year ended December 31, 2020 included an expense of $165,000 to terminate our interest rate swap agreements associated with our bank debt refinancing during the first quarter of 2020, which is recorded as a component of interest expense. Given the debt refinancing to fixed rate loans during the first quarter of 2020 and the refinancing we closed during the fourth quarter of 2020, we anticipate that our interest expense will be approximately $317,000, $287,000 and $258,000 during the years ending December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Interest income was $27,000 and $121,000 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Less interest income was earned during 2020 largely because we had less cash and short-term investments on hand and a lower interest rate environment. The results included a non-cash write-off of fixed assets in the amount of $39,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 in comparison to $2,000 during 2019.\nLoss Before Income Taxes\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, our loss before income taxes decreased by 19%, or $235,000, to $1 million, in comparison to a loss before income taxes of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The largest contributor to this improvement was the $938,000 in other income recognized from the forgiveness of our Paycheck Protection Program loan from the federal government during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nImmuCell Corporation\nIncome Taxes and Net Loss\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded income tax (benefit) expense of ($10,000) and $28,000, respectively. Our income tax (benefit) expense amounted to (1%) and 2% of our loss before income taxes during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our net loss of $1 million, or $0.14 per share, during the year ended December 31, 2020 was in comparison to a net loss of $1.3 million, or $0.19 per share, during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFor tax return purposes only, our depreciation expense for the Nisin Drug Substance production facility and equipment was approximately $464,000, $639,000, $9.2 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The significant increase during 2018 was largely related to accelerated depreciation allowed for tax purposes. As of December 31, 2020, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $14.6 million, which will be available to offset future taxable income. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. This legislation makes significant changes in the U.S. tax laws, including a reduction in the corporate tax rates, changes to net operating loss carryforwards and carrybacks, and a repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax. The legislation reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate from 34% to 21%. Our income tax rate differs from this standard tax rate primarily because we are currently providing for a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. While we are recording this full valuation allowance and therefore not recognizing a benefit on our tax losses, our income tax expense is largely comprised of the tax effect of the interest rate swap agreements that we terminated during the first quarter of 2020.\nIn addition to the above results from our Statements of Operations, we believe it is important to consider our Statements of Cash Flows in the accompanying audited financial statements to assess the cash generating ability of our operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States. All professional accounting standards that were effective and applicable to us as of December 31, 2020 have been taken into consideration in preparing the financial statements. The preparation of financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, income taxes, contingencies and the useful lives and carrying values of intangible and long lived assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have chosen to highlight certain policies that we consider critical to the operations of our business and understanding our financial statements.\nWe sell products that provide Immediate Immunity\u2122 to newborn dairy and beef cattle. We recognize revenue in accordance with the five step model in ASC 606. These include i) identification of the contract with the customer, ii) identification of the performance obligations in the contract, iii) determination of the transaction price, iv) allocation of the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract and v) recognition of revenue associated with performance obligations as they are satisfied. We recognize revenue at the time of shipment (including to distributors) for substantially all products, as title and risk of loss pass to the customer on delivery to the common carrier after concluding that collectability is reasonably assured. We do not bill for or collect sales tax because our sales are generally made to distributors and thus our sales to them are not subject to sales tax. We generally have experienced an immaterial amount of product returns.\t\nInventory includes raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods and is recorded at the lower of cost, on the first-in, first-out method, or net realizable value (determined as the estimated selling price in the normal course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation). Work-in-process and finished goods inventories include materials, labor and manufacturing overhead.\nImmuCell Corporation", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition and operations of ImmuCell Corporation.

OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. One should review Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report for a discussion of some of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results, objectives or expectations described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNet cash provided by operating activities improved to $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 in comparison to $234,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash paid for capital expenditures was $4.1 million and $1.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our total depreciation expense was approximately $2.3 million and $2.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We anticipate that depreciation expense, while not affecting our cash flows from operations, will result in net operating losses until and unless product sales increase sufficiently to offset these non-cash expenses. Going forward, repayments of the indebtedness incurred to fund these capital expenditures and acquire these assets will reduce our cash flows. Debt principal payments (exclusive of the $8.3 million used to repay our refinanced bank debt during the first quarter of 2020 and $624,000 used to pay down our mortgage loan during the fourth quarter of 2020) were $633,000 and $861,000 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We are obligated to make principal repayments of approximately $768,000, $818,000 and $916,000 under these loans during the years ending December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.\nImmuCell Corporation\nBased on our best estimates and projections, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, together with gross margin anticipated to be earned from ongoing product sales, will be sufficient to meet our most urgent working capital and capital expenditure requirements and to finance our ongoing business operations for at least twelve months (which is the period of time required to be addressed for such purposes by accounting disclosure standards) from the date of this filing. We have funded most of our business operations principally from the gross margin on our product sales and equity and debt financings. The table below summarizes the changes in selected, key accounts (in thousands, except for percentages):\n\n (1) There were approximately 414,000 and 389,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance for stock options that were outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. \nFrom the first quarter of 2016 through the first quarter of 2019, we raised gross proceeds of approximately $22.5 million (net proceeds were approximately $20.5 million) from five different common equity transactions priced between $5.25 and $7.30 per share. No warrants were issued in connection with any of these transactions, and no convertible or preferred securities were issued.\nFrom 2010 to 2017, we secured five different debt financings with TDBank N.A., each with different maturity dates and balloon principal repayment obligations. During the first quarter of 2020, we closed on a debt refinancing aggregating $8.6 million plus a line of credit in the amount of $1.0 million with Gorham Savings Bank (GSB). This new debt was comprised of a $5.1 million mortgage loan that bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.50% per annum (with a 10-year term and 25-year amortization schedule) and a $3.5 million note that bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.50% per annum (with a 7-year term and amortization schedule). The refinancing proceeds were used to provide some additional working capital, but mostly to refinance $8.3 million of then outstanding bank debt and pay off an interest rate swap termination liability of $165,000. This debt refinancing improved our liquidity by lowering our interest expense, spreading our principal payments out over a longer time period and eliminating pending balloon principal payments that existed under some of the repaid debt. We were required to hold $1.4 million in escrow (a non-current asset), which reduced the effective availability of our liquid assets for operational needs by that amount. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we closed on a $1.5 million note with GSB that bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.5% per annum (with a 7-year term and amortization schedule). We used $624,000 of the proceeds to prepay a portion of the then outstanding principal on our mortgage loan, which reduced the then outstanding balance to 80% of the most recent appraised value of the property securing the debt, which allowed GSB to release the $1.4 million of funds held in escrow. These credit facilities are subject to certain restrictions and financial covenants and are secured by substantially all of our assets, including our facility at 56 Evergreen Drive in Portland (which was independently appraised at $4.2 million in connection with the 2015 financing and at $3 million in connection with the 2020 refinancing) and our facility at 33 Caddie Lane in Portland (which was independently appraised at $3.2 million in connection with the 2017 financing and at $2.5 million in connection with the 2020 refinancing).We are required to meet a minimum debt service coverage ratio set by GSB of 1.35. Our actual debt service coverage ratio was equal to 2.03 and 1.57 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. However, based on current projections of our future financial performance, which includes a high level of ongoing product development expenses to support Re-Tain\u2122, we may not satisfy this annual requirement for the year ending December 31, 2021. We are negotiating an acceptable solution with GSB.\nDuring June 2020, we received a $500,000 loan from the Maine Technology Institute that is subordinated to all other bank debt. The first 27 months of this loan are interest-free with no interest accrual or required principal payments. Principal and interest payments at a fixed rate of 5% per annum are due quarterly over the final five years of the loan, beginning during the fourth quarter of 2022 and continuing through the third quarter of 2027. The loan may be prepaid without penalty at any time.\nImmuCell Corporation\nOur capital expenditures during the seven-year period from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2020 are described in the following table:\n\nPROJECT A (which was completed during 2016) included a 7,100 square foot facility addition at 56 Evergreen Drive and related equipment and cold storage capacity to increase the production capacity for the First Defense\u00ae product line. During the first quarter of 2016, we completed this investment, increasing our freeze drying capacity by 100% and making other improvements to our liquid processing capacity, which increased our annual production capacity (in terms of annual sales dollars) to approximately $16.5 million. The actual value of this production output varies based on production yields, selling price, product format mix and other factors. This investment also included the construction and equipping of a pilot plant for small-scale Drug Substance production facility for Re-Tain\u2122 within our First Defense\u00ae production facility at 56 Evergreen. Since Project B was completed, this space has been used to produce the gel tube formats of the First Defense\u00ae product line. One of the objectives of Project C is to move the gel tube operations to 175 Industrial Way so that the vacated space can be used to double our liquid processing capacity at 56 Evergreen Drive. \t\nPROJECT B (which was completed during 2018) was related to the Drug Substance production facility for Re-Tain\u2122 at 33 Caddie Lane. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed construction of the Drug Substance production facility. We began equipment installation during the third quarter of 2017, and we completed this installation during the third quarter of 2018. The total cost of this investment for the Drug Substance production facility and related processing equipment was $20.8 million plus $331,000 for the land and $472,000 for the acquisition of an adjacent 4,100 square foot warehouse facility, which is now being used for First Defense\u00ae operations.\t\nPROJECT C (which we anticipate completing during the second quarter of 2021) consists of significant renovations to a 14,300 square foot leased facility at 175 Industrial Way, some facility modifications at 56 Evergreen Drive and the necessary production equipment to increase the annual production capacity of the First Defense\u00ae product line (in terms of annual sales dollars) from approximately $16.5 million to approximately $23 million. These production capacity projections differ moderately from prior estimates largely because of biological yield differences and changes in the product format mix. The actual value of our production output varies based on production yields, selling price, product format mix and other factors. This expansion involves a 50% increase in our freeze drying capacity and a 100% increase in our liquid processing capacity. Renovations to our leased facility at 175 Industrial Way to enable this expansion were completed during the second quarter of 2020. A site license approval for this new facility was issued by the USDA during the third quarter of 2020. By moving our powder filling and assembly services from 56 Evergreen Drive into this new space at 175 Industrial Way, we created space at 56 Evergreen Drive for the installation of the expanded freeze drying capacity. We completed that installation during the first quarter of 2021. Presently, we are completing the relocation of our gel formulation equipment from 56 Evergreen Drive to 175 Industrial Way, creating space for the doubling of our liquid processing capacity at 56 Evergreen Drive. We deferred the implementation of this final phase of the expansion project to the second quarter of 2021 in order not to disrupt finished product releases during our peak selling season. Equipment modifications and relocations of this nature require a shut down of operations for several weeks to validate the modified equipment and achieve USDA approval for its use in its new location. Since this investment was initiated during 2019 and through December 31, 2020, we paid approximately $3.2 million towards Project C, leaving an investment of approximately $300,000 to complete the investment during the second quarter of 2021. As part of this $3.5 million investment, we also have made the facility modifications necessary for a future expansion of our freeze drying capacity by an additional 33%, which would increase our annual production capacity from approximately $23 million to approximately $30 million. The equipment required to achieve this further production capacity increase would cost approximately an additional $800,000. We anticipate bringing this further expanded production capacity on-line during the second half of 2022 to meet projected growth in sales demand.\nImmuCell Corporation\nPROJECT D (construction of which we anticipate completing by the end of 2022) is a $4 million budgeted investment to bring the formulation and aseptic filling services for Re-Tain\u2122 Drug Product in-house to end our reliance on third-party Drug Product manufacturing services. We expect this facility to be operational during 2022. Since this investment was initiated during 2019 and through December 31, 2020, we have expended approximately $1.1 million towards Project D, leaving an investment of approximately $2.9 million to complete the project during 2021 and 2022.\t\nPROJECT E represents other miscellaneous, routine and necessary capital investments and replacements during the years. The original budget for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $300,000 was increased to $450,000. The budget for 2021 and 2022 is $550,000 per year.\nWe have set aside approximately $4.3 million of the $7.9 million of the cash we had on hand as of December 31, 2020 to complete the investments in Projects C and D and to fund Project E for 2021 and 2022. We plan to complete our $3.5 million investment to increase our production capacity so that we can fill the backlog of orders, meet ongoing demand and use any excess production to build inventory stocks by the end of 2021. This will also require that we invest some available cash in inventory. Our inventory balances were $2.1 million and $2.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our inventory balances consisted of approximately 1% and 21% finished goods as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 5 to the accompanying audited financial statements for more details about our inventory.\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, the City of Portland approved a Tax Increment Financing (TIF) credit enhancement package that reduces the real estate taxes on our Drug Substance production facility for Re-Tain\u2122 by 65% over the eleven-year period beginning on July 1, 2017 and ending June 30, 2028 and by 30% during the year ending June 30, 2029, at which time the rebate expires. During the second quarter of 2017, the TIF was approved by the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development. The value of the tax savings will increase (decrease) in proportion to any increase (decrease) in the assessment of the building for city real estate tax purposes. The following table discloses how much of the new taxes we have generated is being relieved by the TIF and how much is being paid by ImmuCell:\n\nResults of Operations\nProduct Sales\nTotal product sales during the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 12%, or $1.6 million, to $15.3 million from $13.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, with domestic sales increasing by 12% and international sales increasing by 11% in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2019. International sales aggregated 11% of total sales during both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The compound annual growth rate of our total product sales during the ten years ended December 31, 2020 was approximately 13%. The compound annual growth rate of our total product sales during the three years ended December 31, 2020 was approximately 18%. Sales achieved during 2020 were the equivalent of approximately 93% of the $16.5 million that we estimate to be our current annual production capacity. As of December 31, 2020, we had depleted our available finished goods inventory and had a backlog of orders worth approximately $1.8 million, compared to backlogs of approximately $130,000, $945,000, $1.4 million and $0 as of September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. If we had been able to ship the backlog of orders before December 31, 2020, our total sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have reached approximately $17.2 million. This pro-forma calculation indicates the current annual demand for our product and demonstrates the need for us to increase our annual production capacity over the current level of approximately $16.5 million (Project C, discussed above). While this is a very positive indication about the strong demand for our First Defense\u00ae product line, not being able to meet the needs of our customers presently could result in the loss of some customers that seek alternative scours management products during this period of short supply and may not resume purchasing our product when we have eliminated the backlog. We are missing some business during the peak season of 2021. As a result of this short supply, we anticipate that our sales during the three-month period ending March 31, 2021 will be approximately 16% lower than the sales recorded during the three-month period ended March 31, 2020. The projected sales for the first quarter of 2021 represent the equivalent of approximately 100% of the $4.1 million that we estimate to be our current quarterly production capacity. As our product mix shifts in favor of Tri-Shield First Defense\u00ae, it has become more difficult to achieve or exceed this estimated production capacity. After our increased production capacity comes on-line during the second quarter of 2021, and assuming we sell and produce to plan, we expect sales for the year ending December 31, 2021 to be greater than sales recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020. A precise estimation of the amount of the recovery from the first quarter sales drop to the anticipated year-over-year sales increase is very difficult to make, given the uncertainties related to the impacts of new business opportunities missed due to COVID-related restrictions and customers lost (that may be or may not return at or above prior levels of purchasing) and other factors experienced during the period of order backlog.\nImmuCell Corporation\nInvestments in the First Defense\u00ae product line have created positive results. Sales of the First Defense\u00ae product line increased by 14% during the year ended December 31, 2020 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2019, aggregating 98% and 97% of our total product sales during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Most of our growth is being realized through increased demand and a deliberate strategy to bias limited production capacity towards Tri-Shield\u00ae (the trivalent format of our product delivered via a gel tube), which provides broader protection to calves.\nStarting in the third quarter of 2016 and through most of 2017, we had sufficient available inventory and were shipping in accordance with the demand of our distributors. However, we quickly sold out of our initial launch quantities of Tri-Shield First Defense\u00ae soon after regulatory approval was obtained during the fourth quarter of 2017. During most of 2018 and into the first half of 2019, we could only accept purchase orders from customers for Tri-Shield\u00ae to match available inventory, which required a careful allocation of product supply directly to certain end-users and veterinary clinics. Initially, production of this new product format did not keep pace with demand primarily because of our inability to produce enough of the new, complex rotavirus vaccine that is used to immunize our source cows. Work on production improvements in our vaccine laboratory throughout 2018 led to significant improvements in vaccine yield and process repeatability resolving this Tri-Shield\u00ae shortfall going into 2019. Allowing for the five to six month production cycle from the manufacture of our proprietary vaccine to the production of a finished dose, we were able to return to a mass market selling approach through distribution for Tri-Shield\u00ae during the second half of 2019. We ended the year with no backlog of orders for the First Defense\u00ae product line as of December, 31 2019. Our current production output was not enough to meet increasing demand for the First Defense\u00ae product line during 2020, and, as noted above, we ended the year with a backlog of orders worth approximately $1.8 million as of December 31, 2020. We expect to fully realize the benefits of our expanded production capacity beginning during the second quarter of 2021.\nValuation of the backlog is a non-GAAP estimate that is based on purchase orders on hand at the time that could not be met because of lack of available inventory. While we are confident that our customers would have accepted and paid for this product if it had been available to ship, we do allow customers to cancel orders, in whole or in part, to meet their current needs as time goes by. This is happening during the first quarter of 2021 and may continue to happen as we work to clear the backlog during the second quarter of 2021. Therefore, the measurement of the backlog amount is no longer a consistent indication of the amount of unmet demand for our product. As the increased production capacity comes online during the second quarter of 2021, we expect to fulfill the remaining backlog and meet ongoing strong demand. This would allow us to build inventory during the second half of 2021and return to a growth mode, as we prepare for peak season sales during the first quarter of 2022 without risk of backlog.\nWe are gaining market share in the United States year after year with our Beyond Vaccination\u00ae strategy. Our share of the market (on a unit volume basis) of scour preventative products administered at the calf-level increased to approximately 41% during 2020 (from 36% during 2019, 34% during 2018 and 32% during 2017). Our share of the market of calves treated with products administered to calves and those administered to the dam prior to calving (adjusting for two doses of dam-level scour vaccines required for primary vaccination of first-calf-heifers) increased to approximately 13% during 2020 (from 11% during 2019, 10.3% during 2018 and 9.7% during 2017). We see the potential for future market share growth in the dairy market, and we have increased our focus on the beef market.\nImmuCell Corporation\nEffective January 1, 2019, we implemented a 2% price increase for Dual-Force\u00ae. Effective February 1, 2020, we implemented a price increase of approximately 2% on the First Defense\u00ae product line (except for Tri-Shield\u00ae and the 90-dose bulk powder format) and CMT. Effective January 1, 2021, we increased our selling price of the First Defense\u00ae product line in the domestic market by approximately 1.6% to 3%, depending on product format, and we increased our selling price of CMT by almost 4%.\nSales of products other than the First Defense\u00ae product line decreased by 44%, or $209,000, to $270,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2019. Sales of these other products aggregated approximately 2% and 3% of our total product sales during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We sell our own CMT (our second leading source of product sales during 2020 and our third leading source of product sales during 2019) which is used to detect somatic cell counts in milk. We acquired a private label product (our third leading source of product sales during 2020 and our second leading source of product sales during 2019) in connection with our January 2016 acquisition of certain gel formulation technology. We have made and sold bulk reagents for Isolate\u2122 (our fourth leading source of product sales during 2019), which is a drinking water test that is sold by our former distributor in the United Kingdom. We made one final sale of this product to this distributor worth $134,000 during the first quarter of 2019. Because this product was non-core to our strategic focus, we sold the underlying cell line assets and intellectual property to our former distributor during the third quarter of 2018 for $700,000. We have retained the rights to all animal health, diagnostic, feed and nutritional applications of this technology.\nThe extent of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economics of our customers and on the demand for our products going forward is very difficult to assess. The Class III milk price (measured in dollars per 100 pounds) averaged $18.16 during the year ended December 31, 2020, but this price has been extremely volatile during the pandemic. For example, the price increased by 102% from a low of $12.14 during May 2020 to a recent high of $24.54 during July, which is very close to an all-time record high of $24.60 during September 2014. Initially, stay at home orders disrupted the food service supply system as schools closed and restaurants were shut down. In response, producers were forced to reduce the supply of milk to the market by drying off cows early, culling cows from the herd and dumping milk, among other tactics. Market conditions are better now, but this volatility remains a concern, and there is no way to be confident that these recent high milk prices will be sustained. The $938,000 in funding that we received from the federal government through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) under the CARES Act helped us maintain full employment without furloughs or layoffs and continue executing our growth plans, even though we may see a future decline in sales and gross margin as a result of the pandemic. The PPP funding created some needed financial liquidity allowing us to move forward with our investments even though we did not achieve the level of sales anticipated in our 2020 budget. After making several inquiries into different laboratories, we were able to have our antibodies tested for effectiveness against COVID-19 during the second quarter of 2020. While we understood that COVID-19 and bovine coronavirus are in different taxonomic groups, we wanted to investigate whether our antibodies could offer some cross-neutralization of COVID-19 in the laboratory testing. Unfortunately,", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. One should review Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report for a discussion of some of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results, objectives or expectations described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNet cash provided by operating activities improved to $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 in comparison to $234,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash paid for capital expenditures was $4.1 million and $1.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our total depreciation expense was approximately $2.3 million and $2.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We anticipate that depreciation expense, while not affecting our cash flows from operations, will result in net operating losses until and unless product sales increase sufficiently to offset these non-cash expenses. Going forward, repayments of the indebtedness incurred to fund these capital expenditures and acquire these assets will reduce our cash flows. Debt principal payments (exclusive of the $8.3 million used to repay our refinanced bank debt during the first quarter of 2020 and $624,000 used to pay down our mortgage loan during the fourth quarter of 2020) were $633,000 and $861,000 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We are obligated to make principal repayments of approximately $768,000, $818,000 and $916,000 under these loans during the years ending December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.\nImmuCell Corporation\nBased on our best estimates and projections, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, together with gross margin anticipated to be earned from ongoing product sales, will be sufficient to meet our most urgent working capital and capital expenditure requirements and to finance our ongoing business operations for at least twelve months (which is the period of time required to be addressed for such purposes by accounting disclosure standards) from the date of this filing. We have funded most of our business operations principally from the gross margin on our product sales and equity and debt financings. The table below summarizes the changes in selected, key accounts (in thousands, except for percentages):\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Decrease) Increase </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,946 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(828 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net working capital </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,946 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,694 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(748 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,692 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stockholders' equity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(725 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Common shares outstanding(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) There were approximately 414,000 and 389,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance for stock options that were outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. \nFrom the first quarter of 2016 through the first quarter of 2019, we raised gross proceeds of approximately $22.5 million (net proceeds were approximately $20.5 million) from five different common equity transactions priced between $5.25 and $7.30 per share. No warrants were issued in connection with any of these transactions, and no convertible or preferred securities were issued.\nFrom 2010 to 2017, we secured five different debt financings with TDBank N.A., each with different maturity dates and balloon principal repayment obligations. During the first quarter of 2020, we closed on a debt refinancing aggregating $8.6 million plus a line of credit in the amount of $1.0 million with Gorham Savings Bank (GSB). This new debt was comprised of a $5.1 million mortgage loan that bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.50% per annum (with a 10-year term and 25-year amortization schedule) and a $3.5 million note that bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.50% per annum (with a 7-year term and amortization schedule). The refinancing proceeds were used to provide some additional working capital, but mostly to refinance $8.3 million of then outstanding bank debt and pay off an interest rate swap termination liability of $165,000. This debt refinancing improved our liquidity by lowering our interest expense, spreading our principal payments out over a longer time period and eliminating pending balloon principal payments that existed under some of the repaid debt. We were required to hold $1.4 million in escrow (a non-current asset), which reduced the effective availability of our liquid assets for operational needs by that amount. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we closed on a $1.5 million note with GSB that bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.5% per annum (with a 7-year term and amortization schedule). We used $624,000 of the proceeds to prepay a portion of the then outstanding principal on our mortgage loan, which reduced the then outstanding balance to 80% of the most recent appraised value of the property securing the debt, which allowed GSB to release the $1.4 million of funds held in escrow. These credit facilities are subject to certain restrictions and financial covenants and are secured by substantially all of our assets, including our facility at 56 Evergreen Drive in Portland (which was independently appraised at $4.2 million in connection with the 2015 financing and at $3 million in connection with the 2020 refinancing) and our facility at 33 Caddie Lane in Portland (which was independently appraised at $3.2 million in connection with the 2017 financing and at $2.5 million in connection with the 2020 refinancing).We are required to meet a minimum debt service coverage ratio set by GSB of 1.35. Our actual debt service coverage ratio was equal to 2.03 and 1.57 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. However, based on current projections of our future financial performance, which includes a high level of ongoing product development expenses to support Re-Tain\u2122, we may not satisfy this annual requirement for the year ending December 31, 2021. We are negotiating an acceptable solution with GSB.\nDuring June 2020, we received a $500,000 loan from the Maine Technology Institute that is subordinated to all other bank debt. The first 27 months of this loan are interest-free with no interest accrual or required principal payments. Principal and interest payments at a fixed rate of 5% per annum are due quarterly over the final five years of the loan, beginning during the fourth quarter of 2022 and continuing through the third quarter of 2027. The loan may be prepaid without penalty at any time.\nImmuCell Corporation\nOur capital expenditures during the seven-year period from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2020 are described in the following table:\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Cash Paid During the Years Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>B </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>C </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>D </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>E </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,512 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>265 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,719 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,093 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,586 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,760 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>434 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,030 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>574 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,391 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,938 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>581 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,073 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,640 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,071 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPROJECT A (which was completed during 2016) included a 7,100 square foot facility addition at 56 Evergreen Drive and related equipment and cold storage capacity to increase the production capacity for the First Defense\u00ae product line. During the first quarter of 2016, we completed this investment, increasing our freeze drying capacity by 100% and making other improvements to our liquid processing capacity, which increased our annual production capacity (in terms of annual sales dollars) to approximately $16.5 million. The actual value of this production output varies based on production yields, selling price, product format mix and other factors. This investment also included the construction and equipping of a pilot plant for small-scale Drug Substance production facility for Re-Tain\u2122 within our First Defense\u00ae production facility at 56 Evergreen. Since Project B was completed, this space has been used to produce the gel tube formats of the First Defense\u00ae product line. One of the objectives of Project C is to move the gel tube operations to 175 Industrial Way so that the vacated space can be used to double our liquid processing capacity at 56 Evergreen Drive. \t\nPROJECT B (which was completed during 2018) was related to the Drug Substance production facility for Re-Tain\u2122 at 33 Caddie Lane. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed construction of the Drug Substance production facility. We began equipment installation during the third quarter of 2017, and we completed this installation during the third quarter of 2018. The total cost of this investment for the Drug Substance production facility and related processing equipment was $20.8 million plus $331,000 for the land and $472,000 for the acquisition of an adjacent 4,100 square foot warehouse facility, which is now being used for First Defense\u00ae operations.\t\nPROJECT C (which we anticipate completing during the second quarter of 2021) consists of significant renovations to a 14,300 square foot leased facility at 175 Industrial Way, some facility modifications at 56 Evergreen Drive and the necessary production equipment to increase the annual production capacity of the First Defense\u00ae product line (in terms of annual sales dollars) from approximately $16.5 million to approximately $23 million. These production capacity projections differ moderately from prior estimates largely because of biological yield differences and changes in the product format mix. The actual value of our production output varies based on production yields, selling price, product format mix and other factors. This expansion involves a 50% increase in our freeze drying capacity and a 100% increase in our liquid processing capacity. Renovations to our leased facility at 175 Industrial Way to enable this expansion were completed during the second quarter of 2020. A site license approval for this new facility was issued by the USDA during the third quarter of 2020. By moving our powder filling and assembly services from 56 Evergreen Drive into this new space at 175 Industrial Way, we created space at 56 Evergreen Drive for the installation of the expanded freeze drying capacity. We completed that installation during the first quarter of 2021. Presently, we are completing the relocation of our gel formulation equipment from 56 Evergreen Drive to 175 Industrial Way, creating space for the doubling of our liquid processing capacity at 56 Evergreen Drive. We deferred the implementation of this final phase of the expansion project to the second quarter of 2021 in order not to disrupt finished product releases during our peak selling season. Equipment modifications and relocations of this nature require a shut down of operations for several weeks to validate the modified equipment and achieve USDA approval for its use in its new location. Since this investment was initiated during 2019 and through December 31, 2020, we paid approximately $3.2 million towards Project C, leaving an investment of approximately $300,000 to complete the investment during the second quarter of 2021. As part of this $3.5 million investment, we also have made the facility modifications necessary for a future expansion of our freeze drying capacity by an additional 33%, which would increase our annual production capacity from approximately $23 million to approximately $30 million. The equipment required to achieve this further production capacity increase would cost approximately an additional $800,000. We anticipate bringing this further expanded production capacity on-line during the second half of 2022 to meet projected growth in sales demand.\nImmuCell Corporation\nPROJECT D (construction of which we anticipate completing by the end of 2022) is a $4 million budgeted investment to bring the formulation and aseptic filling services for Re-Tain\u2122 Drug Product in-house to end our reliance on third-party Drug Product manufacturing services. We expect this facility to be operational during 2022. Since this investment was initiated during 2019 and through December 31, 2020, we have expended approximately $1.1 million towards Project D, leaving an investment of approximately $2.9 million to complete the project during 2021 and 2022.\t\nPROJECT E represents other miscellaneous, routine and necessary capital investments and replacements during the years. The original budget for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $300,000 was increased to $450,000. The budget for 2021 and 2022 is $550,000 per year.\nWe have set aside approximately $4.3 million of the $7.9 million of the cash we had on hand as of December 31, 2020 to complete the investments in Projects C and D and to fund Project E for 2021 and 2022. We plan to complete our $3.5 million investment to increase our production capacity so that we can fill the backlog of orders, meet ongoing demand and use any excess production to build inventory stocks by the end of 2021. This will also require that we invest some available cash in inventory. Our inventory balances were $2.1 million and $2.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our inventory balances consisted of approximately 1% and 21% finished goods as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 5 to the accompanying audited financial statements for more details about our inventory.\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, the City of Portland approved a Tax Increment Financing (TIF) credit enhancement package that reduces the real estate taxes on our Drug Substance production facility for Re-Tain\u2122 by 65% over the eleven-year period beginning on July 1, 2017 and ending June 30, 2028 and by 30% during the year ending June 30, 2029, at which time the rebate expires. During the second quarter of 2017, the TIF was approved by the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development. The value of the tax savings will increase (decrease) in proportion to any increase (decrease) in the assessment of the building for city real estate tax purposes. The following table discloses how much of the new taxes we have generated is being relieved by the TIF and how much is being paid by ImmuCell:\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td>Assessed Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve-Month\nPeriod Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total New\nTaxes\nGenerated\nby the Project </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less:\nTIF Credit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Amount\nPaid by\nImmuCell </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>1.7M @ April 1, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>4.0M @ April 1, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>4.0M @ April 1, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>4.0M @ April 1, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nProduct Sales\nTotal product sales during the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 12%, or $1.6 million, to $15.3 million from $13.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, with domestic sales increasing by 12% and international sales increasing by 11% in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2019. International sales aggregated 11% of total sales during both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The compound annual growth rate of our total product sales during the ten years ended December 31, 2020 was approximately 13%. The compound annual growth rate of our total product sales during the three years ended December 31, 2020 was approximately 18%. Sales achieved during 2020 were the equivalent of approximately 93% of the $16.5 million that we estimate to be our current annual production capacity. As of December 31, 2020, we had depleted our available finished goods inventory and had a backlog of orders worth approximately $1.8 million, compared to backlogs of approximately $130,000, $945,000, $1.4 million and $0 as of September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. If we had been able to ship the backlog of orders before December 31, 2020, our total sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have reached approximately $17.2 million. This pro-forma calculation indicates the current annual demand for our product and demonstrates the need for us to increase our annual production capacity over the current level of approximately $16.5 million (Project C, discussed above). While this is a very positive indication about the strong demand for our First Defense\u00ae product line, not being able to meet the needs of our customers presently could result in the loss of some customers that seek alternative scours management products during this period of short supply and may not resume purchasing our product when we have eliminated the backlog. We are missing some business during the peak season of 2021. As a result of this short supply, we anticipate that our sales during the three-month period ending March 31, 2021 will be approximately 16% lower than the sales recorded during the three-month period ended March 31, 2020. The projected sales for the first quarter of 2021 represent the equivalent of approximately 100% of the $4.1 million that we estimate to be our current quarterly production capacity. As our product mix shifts in favor of Tri-Shield First Defense\u00ae, it has become more difficult to achieve or exceed this estimated production capacity. After our increased production capacity comes on-line during the second quarter of 2021, and assuming we sell and produce to plan, we expect sales for the year ending December 31, 2021 to be greater than sales recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020. A precise estimation of the amount of the recovery from the first quarter sales drop to the anticipated year-over-year sales increase is very difficult to make, given the uncertainties related to the impacts of new business opportunities missed due to COVID-related restrictions and customers lost (that may be or may not return at or above prior levels of purchasing) and other factors experienced during the period of order backlog.\nImmuCell Corporation\nInvestments in the First Defense\u00ae product line have created positive results. Sales of the First Defense\u00ae product line increased by 14% during the year ended December 31, 2020 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2019, aggregating 98% and 97% of our total product sales during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Most of our growth is being realized through increased demand and a deliberate strategy to bias limited production capacity towards Tri-Shield\u00ae (the trivalent format of our product delivered via a gel tube), which provides broader protection to calves.\nStarting in the third quarter of 2016 and through most of 2017, we had sufficient available inventory and were shipping in accordance with the demand of our distributors. However, we quickly sold out of our initial launch quantities of Tri-Shield First Defense\u00ae soon after regulatory approval was obtained during the fourth quarter of 2017. During most of 2018 and into the first half of 2019, we could only accept purchase orders from customers for Tri-Shield\u00ae to match available inventory, which required a careful allocation of product supply directly to certain end-users and veterinary clinics. Initially, production of this new product format did not keep pace with demand primarily because of our inability to produce enough of the new, complex rotavirus vaccine that is used to immunize our source cows. Work on production improvements in our vaccine laboratory throughout 2018 led to significant improvements in vaccine yield and process repeatability resolving this Tri-Shield\u00ae shortfall going into 2019. Allowing for the five to six month production cycle from the manufacture of our proprietary vaccine to the production of a finished dose, we were able to return to a mass market selling approach through distribution for Tri-Shield\u00ae during the second half of 2019. We ended the year with no backlog of orders for the First Defense\u00ae product line as of December, 31 2019. Our current production output was not enough to meet increasing demand for the First Defense\u00ae product line during 2020, and, as noted above, we ended the year with a backlog of orders worth approximately $1.8 million as of December 31, 2020. We expect to fully realize the benefits of our expanded production capacity beginning during the second quarter of 2021.\nValuation of the backlog is a non-GAAP estimate that is based on purchase orders on hand at the time that could not be met because of lack of available inventory. While we are confident that our customers would have accepted and paid for this product if it had been available to ship, we do allow customers to cancel orders, in whole or in part, to meet their current needs as time goes by. This is happening during the first quarter of 2021 and may continue to happen as we work to clear the backlog during the second quarter of 2021. Therefore, the measurement of the backlog amount is no longer a consistent indication of the amount of unmet demand for our product. As the increased production capacity comes online during the second quarter of 2021, we expect to fulfill the remaining backlog and meet ongoing strong demand. This would allow us to build inventory during the second half of 2021and return to a growth mode, as we prepare for peak season sales during the first quarter of 2022 without risk of backlog.\nWe are gaining market share in the United States year after year with our Beyond Vaccination\u00ae strategy. Our share of the market (on a unit volume basis) of scour preventative products administered at the calf-level increased to approximately 41% during 2020 (from 36% during 2019, 34% during 2018 and 32% during 2017). Our share of the market of calves treated with products administered to calves and those administered to the dam prior to calving (adjusting for two doses of dam-level scour vaccines required for primary vaccination of first-calf-heifers) increased to approximately 13% during 2020 (from 11% during 2019, 10.3% during 2018 and 9.7% during 2017). We see the potential for future market share growth in the dairy market, and we have increased our focus on the beef market.\nImmuCell Corporation\nEffective January 1, 2019, we implemented a 2% price increase for Dual-Force\u00ae. Effective February 1, 2020, we implemented a price increase of approximately 2% on the First Defense\u00ae product line (except for Tri-Shield\u00ae and the 90-dose bulk powder format) and CMT. Effective January 1, 2021, we increased our selling price of the First Defense\u00ae product line in the domestic market by approximately 1.6% to 3%, depending on product format, and we increased our selling price of CMT by almost 4%.\nSales of products other than the First Defense\u00ae product line decreased by 44%, or $209,000, to $270,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2019. Sales of these other products aggregated approximately 2% and 3% of our total product sales during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We sell our own CMT (our second leading source of product sales during 2020 and our third leading source of product sales during 2019) which is used to detect somatic cell counts in milk. We acquired a private label product (our third leading source of product sales during 2020 and our second leading source of product sales during 2019) in connection with our January 2016 acquisition of certain gel formulation technology. We have made and sold bulk reagents for Isolate\u2122 (our fourth leading source of product sales during 2019), which is a drinking water test that is sold by our former distributor in the United Kingdom. We made one final sale of this product to this distributor worth $134,000 during the first quarter of 2019. Because this product was non-core to our strategic focus, we sold the underlying cell line assets and intellectual property to our former distributor during the third quarter of 2018 for $700,000. We have retained the rights to all animal health, diagnostic, feed and nutritional applications of this technology.\nThe extent of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economics of our customers and on the demand for our products going forward is very difficult to assess. The Class III milk price (measured in dollars per 100 pounds) averaged $18.16 during the year ended December 31, 2020, but this price has been extremely volatile during the pandemic. For example, the price increased by 102% from a low of $12.14 during May 2020 to a recent high of $24.54 during July, which is very close to an all-time record high of $24.60 during September 2014. Initially, stay at home orders disrupted the food service supply system as schools closed and restaurants were shut down. In response, producers were forced to reduce the supply of milk to the market by drying off cows early, culling cows from the herd and dumping milk, among other tactics. Market conditions are better now, but this volatility remains a concern, and there is no way to be confident that these recent high milk prices will be sustained. The $938,000 in funding that we received from the federal government through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) under the CARES Act helped us maintain full employment without furloughs or layoffs and continue executing our growth plans, even though we may see a future decline in sales and gross margin as a result of the pandemic. The PPP funding created some needed financial liquidity allowing us to move forward with our investments even though we did not achieve the level of sales anticipated in our 2020 budget. After making several inquiries into different laboratories, we were able to have our antibodies tested for effectiveness against COVID-19 during the second quarter of 2020. While we understood that COVID-19 and bovine coronavirus are in different taxonomic groups, we wanted to investigate whether our antibodies could offer some cross-neutralization of COVID-19 in the laboratory testing.
