conversion of a paper machine to a fluff pulp line. We anticipate some volatility in softwood and fluff pulp markets due to the strong U.S. dollar and new capacity additions. Costs, including freight, labor and raw materials, are expected to marginally increase. In Personal Care, investments in advertising and promotion in addition to new customer wins should drive higher sales.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section presents a discussion and

This decrease was mostly due to a premium of $42 million paid in August 2015 on the partial repayment of the 9.5% Notes due 2016 and on the 10.75% Notes due 2017 as well as a decrease in interest expense on these Notes as a result of the partial repayment. In addition, interest expense also decreased due to the repayment at maturity of the 7.125% Notes due in August 2015 as well as the maturity of the 9.5% Notes in August 2016. This decrease was partially offset by interest expense related to the borrowing under the Term Loan Agreement drawn down in the third quarter of 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nFor 2016, our income tax expense was $29 million compared to a tax expense of $14 million in 2015, which yields an effective tax rate of 18% and 9% for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDuring 2016, we recorded $18 million of tax credits, mainly research and experimentation credits, which significantly impacted the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for 2016 was also significantly impacted by our foreign operations being taxed at lower statutory tax rates.\nDuring 2015, we recorded $16 million of tax credits, mainly research and experimentation credits, which significantly impacted the effective tax rate. Additionally, the effective tax rate for 2015 was also positively impacted by the manufacturing deduction in the U.S., enacted law changes in various U.S. states, and the impact of our foreign operations being taxed at lower statutory tax rates.\nValuation Allowances\nIn 2016, we recorded a net valuation allowance reversal of $1 million related to certain foreign loss carryforwards, which impacted the effective tax rate for the year. In 2015, we also recorded a net valuation reversal of $1 million, mainly related to foreign loss carryforwards, which impacted the effective tax rate for the year.\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> 2015 VS. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change in Segmented Operating Income due to\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Volume/\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Depreciation/\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other Income/\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Mix\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Input Costs (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Impairment (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Restructuring (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expense (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pulp and Paper\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (211\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (61\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (82\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal Care\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (222\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (64\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (76\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommentary:\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Includes raw materials (such as: fiber, chemicals, nonwovens and super absorbent polymers) and energy expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> (b)\n</td> <td> Includes maintenance, freight costs, SG&A expenses and other costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> (c)\n</td> <td> In 2015, we recorded $77 million of accelerated depreciation related to the conversion of a paper machine to a high quality fluff pulp line at our Ashdown mill.

The increase was mostly due to debt refinancing costs of $42 million in August 2015 on the partial repayment of the 9.5% Notes due 2016 and of the 10.75% Notes due 2017, partially offset by a corresponding decrease in interest expense on these Notes. In addition, interest expense also decreased on the 7.125% Notes due to their maturity in August 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nFor 2015, our income tax expense was $14 million compared to a tax benefit of $170 million in 2014, which approximated an effective tax rate of 9% and -65% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDuring 2015, we recorded $16 million of tax credits, mainly research and experimentation credits, which significantly impacted the effective tax rate. Additionally, the effective tax rate for 2015 was also positively impacted by the manufacturing deduction in the U.S., enacted law changes in various U.S. states, and the impact of our foreign operations being taxed at lower statutory tax rates.\nIn 2014, the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) completed its ongoing U.S. federal income tax audit for tax years 2009, 2010, and 2011, and we filed related amended state tax returns. The net impact of the audit resolution resulted in a tax benefit of $207 million for 2014, which impacted the effective tax rate. This benefit consisted primarily of the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of $200 million and additional U.S. manufacturing deductions of $7 million. The effective tax rate was also positively impacted by the recognition of $18 million of AFTC with no related tax expense. Also during 2014, we recorded $18 million of tax credits, mainly research and experimentation credits pertaining to current and prior years. The effective tax rate for 2014 was also impacted by an enacted tax rate decrease in Spain, tax losses related to functional currency differences and the impact of our foreign operations being taxed at lower statutory tax rates.\nValuation Allowances\nIn 2015, we recorded a net valuation allowance reversal of $1 million related to certain foreign loss carryforwards, which impacted the effective tax rate for the year. In 2014, we recorded a net valuation allowance of $7 million, mainly related to foreign loss carryforwards, which impacted the effective tax rate for the year.\nSEGMENT REVIEW\nPulp and Paper\nSales in our Pulp and Paper segment decreased by $219 million, or 5% when compared to sales in 2015. This decrease in sales is mostly due to a 3% decrease in net average selling prices for pulp and paper as well as a decrease in our paper sales volumes, partially offset by an increase in our pulp sales volumes of approximately 2%.\nOperating income in our Pulp and Paper segment amounted to $217 million in 2016, a decrease of $53 million, when compared to operating income of $270 million in 2015.

The non-employee directors only receive DSUs. We generally grant awards annually and use, when available, treasury stock to fulfill awards settled in common stock and options exercises.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, stock-based compensation expense recognized in our results of operations was $16 million (2015- $10 million; 2014 - $9 million) for all outstanding awards. Stock-based compensation expense not yet recognized amounted to $17 million (2015 - $16 million; 2014 - $14 million) and will be recognized over the remaining service period of approximately 26 months. The aggregate value of liability awards settled in 2016 was $4 million (2015 - $4 million; 2014 - $12 million). The total fair value of equity awards settled in 2016 was $2 million, representing the fair value at the time of settlement. The fair value at the grant date for these settled equity awards was $3 million. Compensation costs for performance awards are based on management's best estimate of the final performance measurement.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur principal cash requirements are for ongoing operating costs, pension contributions, working capital and capital expenditures, as well as principal and interest payments on our debt and income tax payments. We expect to fund our liquidity needs primarily with internally generated funds from our operations and, to the extent necessary, through borrowings under our contractually committed $700 million credit facility, of which $650 million is currently undrawn and available, or through our $150 million receivables securitization facility, of which $32 million is currently undrawn and available. Under adverse market conditions, there can be no assurance that these agreements would be available or sufficient. See Capital Resources\u201d below.\nOur ability to make payments on the requirements mentioned above will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Our credit and\nreceivable securitization facilities and debt indentures impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, to provide for unanticipated capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities.\nA portion of our cash is held outside the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. The earnings of the foreign subsidiaries, which reflect full provision for local income taxes, are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. We do not intend on repatriating these funds and no provision is made for income taxes that would be payable upon the distribution of earnings from foreign subsidiaries as computation of these amounts is not practical.\nOperating Activities\nOur operating cash flow requirements are primarily for salaries and benefits, the purchase of fiber, energy and raw materials and other expenses such as income tax and property taxes.\nCash flows provided from operating activities totaled $465 million in 2016, a $12 million increase compared to cash flows provided from operating activities of $453 million in 2015. This increase in cash flows provided from operating activities is primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements in 2016 when compared to 2015 as a result of inventory draw down and cash collection on accounts receivable, partially offset by lower profitability. We made income tax payments, net of refunds, of $40 million in 2016 compared to income tax payments, net of refunds of $34 million in 2015. We paid $21 million of employer pension and other post-retirement contribution in excess of pension and other post-retirement expense in 2016, compared to $1 million in 2015. We paid debt refinancing costs of $42 million in 2015.\nCash flows provided from operating activities totaled $453 million in 2015, a $181 million decrease compared to cash flows provided from operating activities of $634 million in 2014. This decrease in cash flows provided from operating activities is primarily due to lower profitability and an increase in working capital requirements in 2015 when compared to 2014, in part due to inventory build-up. We received cash of $34 million in the first quarter of 2014 due to the impact of the Spanish government supplier payment plan on past due receivables, paid debt refinancing costs of $42 million in the third quarter of 2015 and made income tax payments, net of refunds of $34 million in 2015.\nIn 2014, we experienced a decrease in working capital requirements, in part due to cash received of $34 million due to the impact of the Spanish government supplier payment plan on past due receivables.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used for investing activities in 2016 amounted to $391 million, a $147 million increase compared to cash flows used for investing activities of $244 million in 2015.\nThe use of cash in 2016 was attributable to additions to property, plant and equipment of $347 million as well as the acquisition of HDIS in the fourth quarter of 2016 for $45 million. This was partially offset by the proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment of $1 million.\nThe use of cash in 2015 was attributable to additions to property, plant and equipment of $289 million, partially offset by the proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment of $36 million. In addition, during the year, we sold $9 million of Asset-backed notes.\nOur annual capital expenditures for 2017 are expected to be between $210 million and $230 million.\nCash flows used for investing activities in 2015 amounted to $244 million, a $542 million decrease compared to cash flows used for investing activities of $786 million in 2014.\nThe use of cash in 2014 was attributable to the acquisition of Indas of $546 million (\u20ac399 million), additions to property, plant and equipment of $236 million and the repurchase of Asset-backed notes from one of our pension plan ($10 million). These items were partially offset by the sale of Asset-backed notes of $5 million in 2014.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows used for financing activities totaled $73 million in 2016 compared to cash flows used for financing activities of $249 million in 2015.\nThe use of cash in 2016 was primarily the result of dividend payments ($102 million) and the repurchase of our common stock ($10 million). This was partially offset by the net proceeds from borrowings under our credit facilities (revolver and receivable securitization) ($30 million) and an increase in our bank indebtedness ($12 million).\nThe use of cash in 2015 was primarily the result of dividend payments ($100 million), a net repayment of our long-term debt ($89 million), the repurchase of our common stock ($50 million) and a reduction in our bank indebtedness ($11 million).\nCash flows used for financing activities totaled $249 million in 2015 compared to cash flows used for financing activities of $326 million in 2014.\nThe use of cash in 2014 was primarily the result of a net repayment of our revolving bank credit facility and other borrowings ($199 million), dividend payments ($84 million), the repurchase of our common stock ($38 million) and a reduction in our bank indebtedness ($6 million). In addition, we repaid $5 million of capital lease relating to land and building in 2014.\nCapital Resources\nNet indebtedness, consisting of bank indebtedness and long-term debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, was $1,168 million as of December 31, 2016 compared to $1,125 million as of December 31, 2015.\nNote Redemptions and Repayment\nOur 9.5% Notes, in the aggregate principal amount of $39 million, matured on August 1, 2016.\nIn the third quarter of 2015, we redeemed $55 million in aggregate principal amount of our 9.5% Notes due 2016, representing approximately 59% of the outstanding notes, and $215 million in aggregate principal amount of our 10.75% Notes due 2017, representing approximately 77% of the outstanding notes. The redemption price was equal to 100% of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, plus the applicable make-whole premium. Debt refinancing costs of $42 million were incurred in the third quarter of 2015.\nIn addition, our 7.125% notes in the aggregate principal amount of $167 million matured on August 15, 2015.\nThe above-noted redemptions and repayment of notes during 2015, were funded through a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities and proceeds from a new $300 million 10 year term loan agreement with a syndicate of bank lenders.\nTerm Loan\nIn the third quarter of 2015, a wholly owned subsidiary of Domtar borrowed $300 million under an unsecured 10 year Term Loan Agreement that matures on July 20, 2025, with certain domestic banks. The facility was fully drawn down on August 19, 2015. The Company and certain significant domestic subsidiaries of the Company unconditionally guarantee any obligations from time to time arising under the Term Loan Agreement. On August 18, 2016, Domtar entered into an amendment to its Term Loan Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, certain insignificant subsidiaries were released from their guarantees of the borrower's obligations under the Term Loan Agreement.\nBorrowings under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.875%. The Term Loan Agreement contains customary covenants, including two financial covenants: (i) an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Term Loan Agreement, that must be maintained at a level of not less than 3 to 1 and (ii) a leverage ratio, as defined in the Term Loan Agreement, that must be maintained at a level of not greater than 3.75 to 1. At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nIn August 2016, we amended and restated our unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with certain domestic and foreign banks, increasing the amount available from $600 million to $700 million. The amendment also extended the Credit Agreement's maturity date from October 3, 2019 to August 18, 2021. The amendment also allows certain foreign subsidiaries to be borrowers under the facility. The maturity date of the facility may be extended by one year and the lender commitments may be increased by up to $400 million, subject to lender approval and customary requirements.\nBorrowings by the Company under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our significant domestic subsidiaries. Borrowings by foreign borrowers under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company, our significant domestic subsidiaries and certain of our foreign significant subsidiaries. The amendment allowed certain insignificant domestic subsidiaries that were previously guarantors, to be released from their guarantees of any obligations under the credit facility.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR, EURIBOR, Canadian bankers' acceptance or prime rate, as applicable, plus a margin linked to our credit rating. In addition, we pay facility fees quarterly at rates dependent on our credit ratings.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary covenants and events of default for transactions of this type, including two financial covenants: (i) an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, that must be maintained at a level of not less than 3 to 1 and (ii) a leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, that must be maintained at a level of not greater than 3.75 to 1 (or 4.00 to 1 upon the occurrence of certain qualifying material acquisitions). At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with these financial covenants, and $50 million was borrowed (December 31, 2015 - $50 million). At December 31, 2016, we had no outstanding letters of credit (December 31, 2015 - nil). At December 31, 2016, we had $650 million unused and available.\nReceivables Securitization\nWe have a $150 million receivables securitization facility that matures in March 2019.\nAt December 31, 2016, borrowings under the receivables securitization facility amounted to $70 million and $48 million of letters of credit under the program (December 31, 2015 - nil and $38 million, respectively). The program contains certain termination events, which include, but are not limited to, matters related to receivable performance, certain defaults occurring under the credit facility or our failure to repay or satisfy material obligations. At December 31, 2016, we had $32 million unused and available under the accounts receivable securitization facility.\nCommon Stock\nOn April 30, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a 2-for-1 split of our common stock to be effected through a stock dividend. Shareholders of record on June 10, 2014 received one additional share for every share they owned on that date. As a result of the stock split, total shares of our common stock outstanding increased from approximately 32.5 million to 65 million.\nDuring 2016, we declared one quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share and three quarterly dividends of $0.415 per share, to holders of our common stock. The total dividends of approximately of $25 million, $26 million, $26 million and $26 million were paid on April 15, 2016, July 15, 2016, October 17, 2016 and January 17, 2017, respectively, to shareholders of record as of April 4, 2016, July 5, 2016, October 3, 2016 and January 3, 2017, respectively.\nDuring 2015, we declared four quarterly dividends of $0.40 per share, to holders of our common stock. The total dividends of approximately $26 million, $25 million, $25 million and $25 million were paid on April 15, 2015, July 15, 2015, October 15, 2015 and January 15, 2016, respectively, to shareholders of record as of April 2, 2015, July 2, 2015, October 2, 2015 and January 4, 2016, respectively.\nOn February 21, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.415 per share to be paid to holders of our common stock. This dividend is to be paid on April 17, 2017 to shareholders of record on April 3, 2017.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nIn the normal course of business, we finance certain of our activities off balance sheet through operating leases.\nGUARANTEES\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, we offer indemnifications relating to the sale of our businesses and real estate. In general, these indemnifications may relate to claims from past business operations, the failure to abide by covenants and the breach of representations and warranties included in sales agreements. Typically, such representations and warranties relate to taxation, environmental, product and employee matters. The terms of these indemnification agreements are generally for an unlimited period of time. At December 31, 2016, we were unable to estimate the potential maximum liabilities for these types of indemnification guarantees as the amounts are contingent upon the outcome of future events, the nature and likelihood of which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, no provision has been recorded. These indemnifications have not yielded significant expenses in the past.\nPension Plans\nWe have indemnified and held harmless the trustees of our pension funds, and the respective officers, directors, employees and agents of such trustees, from any and all costs and expenses arising out of the performance of their obligations under the relevant trust agreements, including in respect of their reliance on authorized instructions from us or for failing to act in the absence of authorized instructions. These indemnifications survive the termination of such agreements. At December 31, 2016, we have not recorded a liability associated with these indemnifications, as we do not expect to make any payments pertaining to these indemnifications.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into certain contractual obligations and commercial commitments. The following tables provide our obligations and commitments at December 31, 2016:\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td> CONTRACT TYPE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> THEREAFTER\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> TOTAL\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions of dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital leases (including interest)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td> COMMITMENT TYPE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> THEREAFTER\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> TOTAL\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions of dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other commercial commitments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Includes commitments to purchase property, plant and equipment, roundwood, wood chips, gas and certain chemicals.

Notes referenced in this section are included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates, assumptions and choices amongst acceptable accounting methods that affect our reported results of operations and financial position. Critical accounting estimates pertain to matters that contain a significant level of management estimates about future events, encompass the most complex and subjective judgments and are subject to a fair degree of measurement uncertainty. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to environmental matters and asset retirement obligations, impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets, closure and restructuring costs, goodwill and intangible assets impairment, pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, income taxes, business combinations and contingencies related to legal claims. These critical accounting estimates and policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe these accounting policies, and others as set forth in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d, should be reviewed as they are essential to understanding our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nEnvironmental Matters and Asset Retirement Obligations\nWe maintain provisions for estimated environmental costs when remedial efforts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Environmental provisions relate mainly to air emissions, effluent treatment, silvicultural activities and site remediation (together referred to as environmental matters\u201d). The environmental cost estimates reflect assumptions and judgments as to probable nature, magnitude and timing of required investigation, remediation and monitoring activities, as well as contribution by other responsible parties.\nThe most significant environmental provision is related to the Seaspan action. As at December 31, 2016, the provision for Seaspan did not change from December 31, 2015. The provision estimates are based on an awarded contract to implement the remediation plan approved by the relevant government authorities. Additional information regarding Seaspan and other environmental matters is available in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d.\nWhile we believe that we have determined the costs for environmental matters likely to be incurred, based on known information, our ongoing efforts to identify potential environmental concerns that may be associated with the properties may lead to future environmental investigations. These efforts may result in the determination of additional environmental costs and liabilities, which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. In addition, environmental laws and regulations and interpretation by regulatory authorities could change which could result in significant changes to our estimates. For further details on Climate change regulation\u201d and other environmental matters refer to Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d.\nAsset retirement obligations are mainly associated with landfill operation and closure and bark pile management. We recognize asset retirement obligations, at fair value, in the period in which we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement of an asset. The fair value is based on the expected cash flow approach, in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes are considered. Probabilities are applied to each of the cash flow scenarios to arrive at an expected cash flow. The estimated cash flows are then discounted using a credit adjusted risk-free interest rate in combination with business-specific and other relevant risks to discount the cash flow. The rates used vary between 5.5% and 12.0%.\nCash flow estimates incorporate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value, whenever that information is available without undue cost and effort. If unavailable, assumptions are based on internal experts, third-party engineers' studies and historical experience in remediation work. As at December 31, 2016, we had an asset retirement obligation provision of $16 million for 13 locations ($16 million in 2015 for 13 locations).\nAt December 31, 2016, we had a provision of $50 million for environmental matters and other asset retirement obligations (2015 - $52 million). Certain of these amounts have been discounted due to more certainty of the timing of expenditures using the credit adjusted risk-free interest rate for the corresponding period until the settlement date. The rates used vary, based on the prevailing rate at the moment of recognition of the liability and on its settlement period. Additional costs, not known or identified, could be incurred for remediation efforts. Based on policies and procedures in place to monitor environmental exposure, management believes that such additional remediation costs would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, result of operations or cash flows.\nImpairment of Property Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets\nProperty, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicating that, at the lowest level of determinable cash flows, the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Step I of the impairment test assesses if the carrying value of the assets exceeds their estimated undiscounted future cash flows in order to assess if the property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets are impaired. In the event the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the net book value of the assets, a Step II impairment test must be carried out to determine the impairment charge. In Step II, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values. Given that there is generally no readily available quoted value for our property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, we determine fair value of our assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition, and by using the liquidation or salvage value in the case of idled assets. The fair value estimate in Step II is based on the undiscounted cash flows used in Step I.\nEstimates of undiscounted future cash flows used to test the recoverability of the property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets includes key assumptions related to selling prices, inflation-adjusted cost projections, forecasted exchange rates (when applicable) and estimated useful life. Changes in our assumptions and estimates may affect our forecasts and may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required. In addition, actual results may vary from our forecasts, and such variations may be material and unfavorable, thereby triggering the need for future impairment tests where our conclusions may differ in reflection of prevailing market conditions.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we announced the conversion of a paper machine at our Ashdown, Arkansas facility to a high quality fluff pulp line. As a result, we recognized $29 million of accelerated depreciation in 2016 ($77 million in 2015).\nUseful Lives\nOn a regular basis, we review the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment and our definite-lived intangible assets. Assessing the reasonableness of the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets requires judgment and is based on currently available information. Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, changes to our business strategy, changes to our capital strategy or changes in regulation can result in useful lives differing from our estimates. Revisions to the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets constitute a change in accounting estimate and are dealt with prospectively by amending depreciation and amortization rates.\nA change in the remaining estimated useful life of a group of assets, or their estimated net salvage value, will affect the depreciation or amortization rate used to depreciate or amortize the group of assets and thus affect depreciation or amortization expense as reported in our results of operations. In 2016, we recorded depreciation and amortization expense of $348 million compared to $359 million and $384 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2016, we had property, plant and equipment with a net book value of $2,825 million ($2,835 million in 2015) and definite-lived intangible assets, net of amortization of $337 million ($339 million in 2015).\nClosure and Restructuring Costs\nClosure and restructuring costs are recognized as liabilities in the period when they are incurred and are measured at their fair value. For such recognition to occur, management, with the appropriate level of authority, must have approved and committed to a firm plan and appropriate communication to those affected must have occurred. These provisions may require an estimation of costs such as severance and termination benefits, pension and related curtailments, environmental remediation and may also include expenses related to demolition and outplacement. Actions taken may also require an evaluation of any remaining assets to determine required impairments, if any, and a review of estimated remaining useful lives which may lead to accelerated depreciation expense.\nEstimates of cash flows and fair value relating to closures and restructuring require judgment. Closure and restructuring liabilities are based on management's best estimates of future events at December 31, 2016. Although we do not anticipate significant changes, the actual costs may differ from these estimates due to subsequent developments such as the results of environmental studies, the ability to find a buyer for assets set to be dismantled and demolished and other business developments. As such, additional costs and further working capital adjustments may be required in future periods.\nIn 2016, in connection with our plan to optimize fluff pulp manufacturing at the Plymouth, North Carolina mill, we recognized $5 million of severance and termination costs.\nDue to the conversion of the paper machine at our Ashdown, Arkansas mill, we recognized $26 million of costs related to the fluff pulp conversion outage. In the fourth quarter of 2016, as a result of a revision in our estimated withdrawal liability for U.S. multiemployer plans, we recorded a credit to earnings of $4 million in Closure and restructuring costs on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nAdditional information can be found under Note 16 Closure and Restructuring Costs and Liability\u201d.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nAll goodwill resides in our Personal Care reporting segment. As of December 31, 2016, we had $550 million of goodwill ($539 million as of December 31, 2015). For further details on goodwill, refer to Note 3 Acquisition of Businesses\u201d and Note 12 Goodwill\u201d.\nFor purposes of impairment testing, goodwill must be assigned to one or more reporting units. In light of the increased integration amongst our acquired businesses, we reviewed and assessed the different components of our Personal Care segment in order to determine our reporting units for goodwill impairment. We concluded that all the components of the Personal Care segment share similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated. Thus goodwill impairment testing was done under one reporting unit.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment at the beginning of the fourth quarter of every year or more frequently whenever indicators of potential impairment exist. Goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. The impairment evaluation is done in a two-step approach.\nWe have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. In performing the qualitative assessment, we identify the relevant drivers of fair value of the reporting unit and the relevant events and circumstances that may have an impact on those drivers of fair value and assess their impact on the fair value of the reporting unit. To carry out the qualitative assessment, we consider elements such as the results of recent fair value assessments, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, specific events affecting the Company and the business. The identification and impact assessment of events and circumstances on the fair value involves significant judgment and assumptions. If a qualitative assessment is performed and after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, then we perform Step 1 of the two-step impairment test. We can also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to Step 1 of the impairment test.\nThe first step is to determine if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value is greater than the carrying amount, including goodwill, no goodwill impairment is necessary.\nWe typically use an income method to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows used to measure the fair value. Key estimates supporting the cash flow projections include, but are not limited to, management's estimates of revenue growth rates and profit margins, economic indicators, industry and market conditions as well as estimates of capital expenditures and assumed terminal growth rates. The financial forecasts are consistent with our operating plans and take into consideration forecasted above-market growth to be driven mainly by recently secured and established customer relationships as well as capital investments in new production lines. The discount rate assumption used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for business-specific and other relevant risks of the reporting units. We also perform an overall reconciliation to corroborate the fair value from the income approach to Domtar's overall market capitalization.\nIn the event that the carrying amount, including goodwill, exceeds the fair value, the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the amount of the impairment charge. Fair value of goodwill in Step II of the impairment test is estimated the same way as goodwill is determined at the date of acquisition in a business combination, that is, the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the business. The excess of the carrying value over the fair value is taken as an impairment charge in the period. Additional information regarding goodwill is available in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d.\nAs of October 1, 2016, the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 24%, therefore no impairment was recognized. Small variations to our assumptions and estimates, particularly in the expected growth rates embedded in our cash flow projections and the discount rate could have a significant impact on fair value. If the reporting unit does not perform in accordance with our expectations over the next few years, we will have to consider reducing our assumed growth rates, which, depending on the magnitude of the change, could result in a partial or full impairment charge.\nThe following table summarizes the approximate impact that a change in certain key assumptions would have on the present value of estimated future cash flows at October 1, 2016. Note that this sensitivity analysis assumes that all other assumptions and trends remain constant for each independent variable.\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> KEY ASSUMPTIONS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Approximate impact on the\ndiscounted cash flows\n(in millions of dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue growth rates (years 2018 - 2021)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (106\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Terminal growth rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 0.5% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 0.5% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (94\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 0.3% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (79\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 0.3% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBetween annual impairment tests, we continue to monitor for potential indicators of impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances occur, such as significant adverse changes in the business climate or operating results or changes in management's business strategy as well as significant changes in Domtar's share price or Domtar's overall market capitalization.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names ($225 million) and catalog rights ($36 million) following the business acquisitions in the Personal Care segment and license rights ($6 million) following the acquisition of Xerox's paper and print media products and water rights ($4 million).\nWe test indefinite-lived intangible assets at the asset level. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are evaluated at the beginning of the fourth quarter of every year or more frequently whenever indicators of potential impairment exist. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts. The qualitative assessment follows the same process as the one performed for goodwill, as described above. If a qualitative assessment is performed and after assessing the qualitative factors, we determine it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts, then a quantitative impairment test is required. We can also elect to proceed directly to the quantitative test.\nIn performing the quantitative assessment, fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is derived using an income approach (including discounted cash flows from a relief from royalty model). Under this approach, we estimate the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows used to measure the fair value. Key estimates supporting the cash flow projections include, but are not limited to, management's estimates of revenue growth rates and profit margins, economic indicators, royalty rates, industry and market conditions as well as assumed terminal growth rates. The financial forecasts are consistent with our operating plans and those supporting the goodwill impairment test described above. The discount rate assumption used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for business-specific and other relevant risks. If the carrying amounts of the indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nIn the fourth quarter 2016, we performed a quantitative assessment for the trade names and catalog rights of the Personal Care segment. All indefinite-lived intangible assets have a fair value that significantly exceeds their respective carrying amounts therefore no impairment charge was recorded. However, different assumptions particularly in the expected growth rates embedded in our cash flow projections and the discount rate could have a significant impact on fair value. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in significant non-cash impairment charges in the future.\nPension Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nWe have several defined contribution plans and multiemployer plans. The pension expense under these plans is equal to our contribution. Defined contribution pension expense was $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 (2015 - $32 million and 2014 - $28 million).\nWe sponsor both contributory and non-contributory U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor a number of other post-retirement benefit plans for eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees; the plans are unfunded and include life insurance programs, medical and dental benefits. In addition, we provide supplemental unfunded defined benefit pension plans and supplemental unfunded defined contribution pension plans to certain senior management employees.\nWe account for pensions and other post-retirement benefits in accordance with Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board-Accounting Standards Committee which requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension plans as an asset or liability in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Pension and other post-retirement benefit charges require assumptions in order to estimate the projected and accumulate benefit obligations. These assumptions require a significant amount of judgment and include:\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> -\n</td> <td> Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets - used to estimate the growth and expected return on assets\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> -\n</td> <td> Discount rate - used to determine interest costs and the net present value of our obligations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> -\n</td> <td> Rate of compensation increase - used to calculate the impact of future increases on our obligations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> -\n</td> <td> Health care cost trends - used to calculate the impact of future health care costs on our obligations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> -\n</td> <td> Employee related factors, such as mortality rates, turnover, retirement age and disabilities - used to determine the extent of our obligations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nChanges in these assumptions result in actuarial gains or losses, which are amortized over the expected average remaining service life of the active employee group covered by the plans, only to the extent that the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses are in excess of 10% of the accrued benefit obligation at the beginning of the year, over the average remaining service period of approximately eight years of the active employee group covered by the pension plans, and 10 years of the active employee group covered by the other post-retirement benefits plans.\nAn expected rate of return on plan assets of 5.3% was considered appropriate by our management for the determination of pension expense for 2016. Effective January 1, 2017, we will use 5.4% as the expected return on plan assets, which reflects the current view of long-term investment returns. The overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on management's best estimate of the long-term returns of the major asset classes (cash and cash equivalents, equities and bonds) weighted by the actual allocation of assets at the measurement date, net of expenses. This rate includes an equity risk premium over government bond returns for equity investments and a value-added premium for the contribution to returns from active management. The sources used to determine management's best estimate of long-term returns are numerous and include country specific bond yields, which may be derived from the market using local bond indices or by analysis of the local bond market, and country-specific inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and analysts' or governments' expectations as applicable.\nWe set our discount rate assumption annually to reflect the rates available on high-quality, fixed income debt instruments, with a duration that is expected to match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments. High-quality debt instruments are corporate bonds with a rating of AA or better. The discount rates at December 31, 2016, for pension plans were estimated at 3.8% for the accrued benefit obligation and 4.1% for the net periodic benefit cost for 2016 and for post-retirement benefit plans were estimated at 3.9% for the accrued benefit obligation and 4.1% for the net periodic benefit cost for 2016.\nEffective December 31, 2015, we changed the approach used to estimate the current service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for Canadian pension plans and U.S. funded pension plans utilizing a yield curve approach. This change compared to the previous approach will result in different current service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) in future periods. Previously, the current service and interest cost components were estimated using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the year for each country. We elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. We made this change to provide a more precise measurement of current service and interest cost components by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. This change does not affect the measurement of the total defined benefit obligation, but will affect the current service and interest cost components going forward. We have accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate.\nThe rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption in the actuarial model for pension (set at 2.7% for the accrued benefit obligation and 2.8% for the net periodic benefit cost) and for post-retirement benefits (set at 2.8% for the accrued benefit obligation and 2.8% for the net periodic benefit cost) and is determined based upon our long-term plans for such increases.\nFor employee related factors, mortality rate tables tailored to our industry were used and the others factor reflect our historical experience and management's best judgment regarding future expectations.\nFor measurement purposes, a 5.0% weighted-average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2016. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.1% by 2034 and remain at that level thereafter.\nThe following table provides a sensitivity analysis of the key weighted average economic assumptions used in measuring the accrued pension benefit obligation, the accrued other post-retirement benefit obligation and related net periodic benefit cost for 2016. The sensitivity analysis should be used with caution as it is hypothetical and changes in each key assumption may not be linear. The sensitivities in each key variable have been calculated independently of each other.\nTable 134: <table></table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Pension\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other Post-Retirement Benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Accrued Benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Periodic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Accrued Benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Periodic\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Benefit Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Benefit Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In millions of dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected rate of return on assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (172\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Assumed overall health care cost trend\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur pension plan funding policy is to contribute annually the amount required to provide for benefits earned in the year, and to fund solvency deficiencies, funding shortfalls and past service obligations over periods not exceeding those permitted by the applicable regulatory authorities. The other post-retirement benefit plans are not funded and contributions are made annually to cover benefit payments. We expect to contribute a minimum total amount of $13 million in 2017 compared to $31 million in 2016 (2015 - $13 million; 2014 - $29 million) to the pension plans. We expect to contribute a minimum total amount of $4 million in 2017 compared to $5 million in 2016 to the other post-retirement benefit plans (2015 - $5 million; 2014 - $5 million).\nBenefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2016 for our pension and post-retirement plans were are follows:\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Pension\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> post-retirement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Pension\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> post-retirement\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> benefit plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> benefit plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accrued benefit obligation at end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,584\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (90\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,509\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (86\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair value of assets at end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Funded status\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (38\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (90\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (86\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor additional details on our pension plans and other post-retirement benefits plans, refer to Note 7 Pension Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\u201d.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined according to differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the assets and liabilities. The change in the net deferred tax asset or liability is included in earnings. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the years in which assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For these years, a projection of taxable income and an assumption of the ultimate recovery or settlement period for temporary differences are required. The projection of future taxable income is based on management's best estimate and may vary from actual taxable income.\nOn a quarterly basis, we assess the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and, if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized based on these taxable income projections, a valuation allowance is recorded. In general, realization\u201d refers to the incremental benefit achieved through the reduction in future taxes payable or an increase in future taxes refundable from the deferred tax assets. Evaluating the need for an amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets often requires significant judgment. All available evidence, both positive and negative, should be considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.\nIn our evaluation process, we give the most weight to historical income or losses. After evaluating all available positive and negative evidence, although realization is not assured, we determined that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets, with the exception of certain state credits and losses for which a valuation allowance of $4 million exists at December 31, 2016, and certain foreign loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance of $18 million exists at December 31, 2016. Of this amount, ($1) million impacted tax expense and the effective tax rate for 2016 (2015 - ($1) million; 2014 - $7 million).\nOur deferred tax assets are mainly composed of temporary differences related to various accruals, accounting provisions, pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities, net operating loss carryforwards, and available tax credits. Our deferred tax liabilities are mainly composed of temporary differences pertaining to property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and other items. Estimating the ultimate settlement period requires judgment. The reversal of timing differences is expected at enacted tax rates, which could change due to changes in income tax laws or the introduction of tax changes through the presentation of annual budgets by different governments. As a result, a change in the timing and the income tax rate at which the components will reverse could materially affect deferred tax expense in our future results of operations.\nIn addition, U.S. and foreign tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation and require judgment that may be challenged by taxation authorities. To the best of our knowledge, we have adequately provided for our future tax consequences based upon current facts and circumstances and current tax law. In accordance with Income Taxes Topic of FASB ASC 740, we evaluate new tax positions that result in a tax benefit to us and determine the amount of tax benefits that can be recognized. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits are evaluated on a quarterly basis to determine if changes in recognition or classification are necessary. Significant changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits expected within the next 12 months are disclosed quarterly. Future recognition of unrecognized tax benefits would impact the effective tax rate in the period the benefits are recognized. At December 31, 2016, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $43 million (2015 - $41 million). These amounts represent the gross amount of exposure in individual jurisdictions and do not reflect any additional benefits expected to be realized if such positions were sustained, such as federal deduction that could be realized if an unrecognized state deduction was not sustained. As of December 31, 2016, we believe it is reasonably possible that up to $12 million of our unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized in 2017, which could significantly impact the effective tax rate. However, the amount and timing of the recognition of these benefits is subject to some uncertainty.\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. U.S. and foreign tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation and require judgment that may be challenged by taxation authorities. Tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that we have adequately provided for our future tax consequences based upon current facts and circumstances and current tax law and we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For further details refer to Note 10 Income taxes\u201d.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the total purchase price of the acquired tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the business combination date, with the excess purchase price recorded as goodwill.\nThe purchase price allocation process required us to use significant estimates and assumptions, including fair value estimates, as of the business combination date. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired company, in part based on valuation models that incorporate projections of expected future cash flows and operating plans and are inherently uncertain. Valuations are performed by management or third party valuation specialists under management's supervision. In determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, as appropriate, we may use one of the following recognized valuation methods: the income approach (including discounted cash flows from relief from royalty and excess earnings model), the market approach and/or the replacement cost approach.\nExamples of significant estimates used to value certain intangible assets acquired include but are not limited to:\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> sales volume, pricing and future cash flows of the business overall\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> future expected cash flows from customer relationships, acquired license rights and other identifiable intangible assets, including future price levels, rates of increase in revenue and appropriate attrition rates\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> the acquired company's trade names and competitive position, royalty rate quantum, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade names will continue to benefit to the combined company's product portfolio\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> discount rates and income tax rates\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHowever, different assumptions regarding projected performance and other factors associated with the acquired assets may affect the amount recorded under each type of asset and liability, mainly between property plant and equipment, intangibles assets, goodwill and deferred income tax liabilities; as well subsequent assessments could result in future impairment charges. The purchase price allocation process also entails us to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained surrounding facts and circumstances existing at acquisition date.\nFor further details, refer to Note 3 Acquisition of Businesses\u201d.\nContingencies related to legal claims\nAs discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors, under the risk Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results or condition\u201d and in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of the then available facts with respect to each matter. When no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated.

In the following discussion, unless otherwise noted, references to increases or decreases in income and expense items, prices, contribution to net earnings (loss), and shipment volumes are based on the twelve months period ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The twelve month periods are also referred to as 2016, 2015 and 2014. Reference to notes refers to footnotes to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThis MD&A of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our recent performance, financial condition and outlook. Topics discussed and analyzed include:\n \u2022 Overview \n \u2022 2016 Highlights \n \u2022 Outlook \n \u2022 Consolidated Results of Operations and Segment Review \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources \n \u2022 Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies \nOVERVIEW\nWe have two reportable segments as described below, which also represent our two operating segments. Each reportable segment offers different products and services and requires different manufacturing processes, technology and/or marketing strategies. The following summary briefly describes the operations included in each of our reportable segments.\nPulp and Paper: Our Pulp and Paper segment consists of the design, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of communication, specialty and packaging papers, as well as softwood, fluff and hardwood pulp.\nPersonal Care: Our Personal Care segment consists of the design, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of absorbent hygiene products.\n2016 HIGHLIGHTS\n \u2022 Operating income and net earnings decreased by 23% and 10%, respectively from 2015 \n \u2022 Sales decreased by 3% from 2015. Net average selling prices for pulp and paper were down from 2015. Our manufactured paper volumes were down while our pulp volumes were up when compared to 2015 \n \u2022 Acquisition of Home Delivery Incontinent Supplies Co. ( HDIS\u201d) on October 1, 2016 \n \u2022 Recognition of closure and restructuring costs of $32 million, of which $26 million is related to the conversion of a paper machine at our Ashdown mill to a high quality fluff pulp line and $5 million is related to our plan to optimize fluff pulp manufacturing at our Plymouth mill \n \u2022 Recognition of accelerated depreciation of $29 million related to the conversion of a paper machine at our Ashdown mill to a high quality fluff pulp line \n \u2022 We repurchased $10 million of our common stock and paid $102 million in dividends \n \n\n\n See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Date under Note 6 \"Earnings per Common Share\" for more information on the calculation of net earnings per common share. \nOUTLOOK\nIn 2017, we expect our paper shipments to be in-line with market demand, while pulp shipments should be higher due to the conversion of a paper machine to a fluff pulp line. We anticipate some volatility in softwood and fluff pulp markets due to the strong U.S. dollar and new capacity additions. Costs, including freight, labor and raw materials, are expected to marginally increase. In Personal Care, investments in advertising and promotion in addition to new customer wins should drive higher sales.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section presents a discussion and analysis of our 2016, 2015 and 2014 net sales, operating income (loss) and other information relevant to the understanding of our results of operations.\n\n\nCommentary:\n (a) Include sales of HDIS since October 1, 2016. \n\n\nCommentary:\n (a) Include results of HDIS since October 1, 2016. \n (b) Includes raw materials (such as fiber, chemicals, nonwovens and super absorbent polymers) and energy expenses. \n (c) Includes maintenance, freight costs, SG&A expenses and other costs. \n (d) In 2016, we recorded $29 million of accelerated depreciation related to the conversion of a paper machine to a high quality fluff pulp line at our Ashdown mill, compared to $77 million recorded in 2015. Depreciation charges were lower by $9 million in 2016, excluding foreign currency impact. \n (e) \n\n (f) \n\nInterest Expense, net\nWe incurred $66 million of net interest expense in 2016, a decrease of $66 million compared to net interest expense of $132 million in 2015. This decrease was mostly due to a premium of $42 million paid in August 2015 on the partial repayment of the 9.5% Notes due 2016 and on the 10.75% Notes due 2017 as well as a decrease in interest expense on these Notes as a result of the partial repayment. In addition, interest expense also decreased due to the repayment at maturity of the 7.125% Notes due in August 2015 as well as the maturity of the 9.5% Notes in August 2016. This decrease was partially offset by interest expense related to the borrowing under the Term Loan Agreement drawn down in the third quarter of 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nFor 2016, our income tax expense was $29 million compared to a tax expense of $14 million in 2015, which yields an effective tax rate of 18% and 9% for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDuring 2016, we recorded $18 million of tax credits, mainly research and experimentation credits, which significantly impacted the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for 2016 was also significantly impacted by our foreign operations being taxed at lower statutory tax rates.\nDuring 2015, we recorded $16 million of tax credits, mainly research and experimentation credits, which significantly impacted the effective tax rate. Additionally, the effective tax rate for 2015 was also positively impacted by the manufacturing deduction in the U.S., enacted law changes in various U.S. states, and the impact of our foreign operations being taxed at lower statutory tax rates.\nValuation Allowances\nIn 2016, we recorded a net valuation allowance reversal of $1 million related to certain foreign loss carryforwards, which impacted the effective tax rate for the year. In 2015, we also recorded a net valuation reversal of $1 million, mainly related to foreign loss carryforwards, which impacted the effective tax rate for the year.\n\nCommentary:\n (a) Includes raw materials (such as: fiber, chemicals, nonwovens and super absorbent polymers) and energy expenses. \n (b) Includes maintenance, freight costs, SG&A expenses and other costs. \n (c) In 2015, we recorded $77 million of accelerated depreciation related to the conversion of a paper machine to a high quality fluff pulp line at our Ashdown mill. In 2014, we recorded $4 million of accelerated depreciation related to the conversion of a paper machine to a pulp line at Ashdown in the fourth quarter of 2014. \n (d) \n\n\n (e) \n\nInterest Expense, net\nWe incurred $132 million of net interest expense in 2015, an increase of $29 million compared to net interest expense of $103 million in 2014. The increase was mostly due to debt refinancing costs of $42 million in August 2015 on the partial repayment of the 9.5% Notes due 2016 and of the 10.75% Notes due 2017, partially offset by a corresponding decrease in interest expense on these Notes. In addition, interest expense also decreased on the 7.125% Notes due to their maturity in August 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nFor 2015, our income tax expense was $14 million compared to a tax benefit of $170 million in 2014, which approximated an effective tax rate of 9% and -65% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDuring 2015, we recorded $16 million of tax credits, mainly research and experimentation credits, which significantly impacted the effective tax rate. Additionally, the effective tax rate for 2015 was also positively impacted by the manufacturing deduction in the U.S., enacted law changes in various U.S. states, and the impact of our foreign operations being taxed at lower statutory tax rates.\nIn 2014, the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) completed its ongoing U.S. federal income tax audit for tax years 2009, 2010, and 2011, and we filed related amended state tax returns. The net impact of the audit resolution resulted in a tax benefit of $207 million for 2014, which impacted the effective tax rate. This benefit consisted primarily of the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of $200 million and additional U.S. manufacturing deductions of $7 million. The effective tax rate was also positively impacted by the recognition of $18 million of AFTC with no related tax expense. Also during 2014, we recorded $18 million of tax credits, mainly research and experimentation credits pertaining to current and prior years. The effective tax rate for 2014 was also impacted by an enacted tax rate decrease in Spain, tax losses related to functional currency differences and the impact of our foreign operations being taxed at lower statutory tax rates.\nValuation Allowances\nIn 2015, we recorded a net valuation allowance reversal of $1 million related to certain foreign loss carryforwards, which impacted the effective tax rate for the year. In 2014, we recorded a net valuation allowance of $7 million, mainly related to foreign loss carryforwards, which impacted the effective tax rate for the year.\nSEGMENT REVIEW\nPulp and Paper\nSales in our Pulp and Paper segment decreased by $219 million, or 5% when compared to sales in 2015. This decrease in sales is mostly due to a 3% decrease in net average selling prices for pulp and paper as well as a decrease in our paper sales volumes, partially offset by an increase in our pulp sales volumes of approximately 2%.\nOperating income in our Pulp and Paper segment amounted to $217 million in 2016, a decrease of $53 million, when compared to operating income of $270 million in 2015. Our results were negatively impacted by:\n \u2022 Lower average selling prices for paper and pulp ($135 million) \n \u2022 Lower volume and mix ($30 million) mostly related to lower volume of paper partially offset by higher volume of pulp \n \u2022 Higher restructuring costs mostly related to the conversion at Ashdown described above and the closure of a pulp dryer and idling of related assets at our Plymouth mill, related to our plan to optimize fluff pulp manufacturing ($28 million) \n \u2022 Higher other income/expense ($13 million) mostly due to net gain on sale of property, plant and equipment in 2015 \nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n \u2022 Lower depreciation charges ($59 million) due to lower accelerated depreciation related to our 2014 decision to convert a paper machine at our Ashdown facility to a high quality fluff pulp line and lower depreciation expenses due to certain assets reaching the end of their useful lives \n \u2022 Positive impact of a weaker Canadian dollar on our Canadian denominated expenses, net of our hedging program ($44 million) \n \u2022 Lower input costs ($44 million) mostly related to lower fiber and energy costs due to improved market and weather conditions \n \u2022 Lower operating expenses ($6 million) mostly related to lower freight costs due to favorable global economic factors including excess vessel capacity, carrier consolidation and lower oil prices as well as lower maintenance costs due to timing of major maintenance when compared to 2015 and reduced scope of outages and cost control measures, partially offset by lower productivity \nSales in 2015 in our Pulp and Paper segment decreased by $216 million, or 5% when compared to sales in 2014. This decrease in sales is mostly due to a 5% decrease in net average selling prices for pulp and paper. Total sales volume and foreign exchange were flat when compared to 2014.\nOperating income in 2015 in our Pulp and Paper segment amounted to $270 million, a decrease of $82 million, when compared to operating income of $352 million in 2014. Our results were negatively impacted by:\n \u2022 Lower average selling prices for paper and pulp ($211 million) \n \u2022 Higher depreciation charges ($61 million) due to higher accelerated depreciation related to our 2014 decision to convert a paper machine at our Ashdown facility to a high quality fluff pulp line, partially offset by lower depreciation expenses due to certain assets reaching the end of their useful lives \n \u2022 Lower other income/expense ($6 million) due to proceeds from insurance claims on machinery and equipment in 2014, increase in bad debt expense as well as other expenses, partially", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

to be in-line with market demand, while pulp shipments should be higher due to the conversion of a paper machine to a fluff pulp line. We anticipate some volatility in softwood and fluff pulp markets due to the strong U.S. dollar and new capacity additions. Costs, including freight, labor and raw materials, are expected to marginally increase. In Personal Care, investments in advertising and promotion in addition to new customer wins should drive higher sales.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section presents a discussion and

This decrease was mostly due to a premium of $42 million paid in August 2015 on the partial repayment of the 9.5% Notes due 2016 and on the 10.75% Notes due 2017 as well as a decrease in interest expense on these Notes as a result of the partial repayment. In addition, interest expense also decreased due to the repayment at maturity of the 7.125% Notes due in August 2015 as well as the maturity of the 9.5% Notes in August 2016. This decrease was partially offset by interest expense related to the borrowing under the Term Loan Agreement drawn down in the third quarter of 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nFor 2016, our income tax expense was $29 million compared to a tax expense of $14 million in 2015, which yields an effective tax rate of 18% and 9% for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDuring 2016, we recorded $18 million of tax credits, mainly research and experimentation credits, which significantly impacted the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for 2016 was also significantly impacted by our foreign operations being taxed at lower statutory tax rates.\nDuring 2015, we recorded $16 million of tax credits, mainly research and experimentation credits, which significantly impacted the effective tax rate. Additionally, the effective tax rate for 2015 was also positively impacted by the manufacturing deduction in the U.S., enacted law changes in various U.S. states, and the impact of our foreign operations being taxed at lower statutory tax rates.\nValuation Allowances\nIn 2016, we recorded a net valuation allowance reversal of $1 million related to certain foreign loss carryforwards, which impacted the effective tax rate for the year. In 2015, we also recorded a net valuation reversal of $1 million, mainly related to foreign loss carryforwards, which impacted the effective tax rate for the year.\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> 2015 VS. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change in Segmented Operating Income due to\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Volume/\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Depreciation/\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other Income/\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Mix\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Input Costs (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Impairment (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Restructuring (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expense (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pulp and Paper\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (211\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (61\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (82\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal Care\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (222\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (64\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (76\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommentary:\n (a) Includes raw materials (such as: fiber, chemicals, nonwovens and super absorbent polymers) and energy expenses. \n (b) Includes maintenance, freight costs, SG&A expenses and other costs. \n (c) In 2015, we recorded $77 million of accelerated depreciation related to the conversion of a paper machine to a high quality fluff pulp line at our Ashdown mill.

The increase was mostly due to debt refinancing costs of $42 million in August 2015 on the partial repayment of the 9.5% Notes due 2016 and of the 10.75% Notes due 2017, partially offset by a corresponding decrease in interest expense on these Notes. In addition, interest expense also decreased on the 7.125% Notes due to their maturity in August 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nFor 2015, our income tax expense was $14 million compared to a tax benefit of $170 million in 2014, which approximated an effective tax rate of 9% and -65% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDuring 2015, we recorded $16 million of tax credits, mainly research and experimentation credits, which significantly impacted the effective tax rate. Additionally, the effective tax rate for 2015 was also positively impacted by the manufacturing deduction in the U.S., enacted law changes in various U.S. states, and the impact of our foreign operations being taxed at lower statutory tax rates.\nIn 2014, the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) completed its ongoing U.S. federal income tax audit for tax years 2009, 2010, and 2011, and we filed related amended state tax returns. The net impact of the audit resolution resulted in a tax benefit of $207 million for 2014, which impacted the effective tax rate. This benefit consisted primarily of the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of $200 million and additional U.S. manufacturing deductions of $7 million. The effective tax rate was also positively impacted by the recognition of $18 million of AFTC with no related tax expense. Also during 2014, we recorded $18 million of tax credits, mainly research and experimentation credits pertaining to current and prior years. The effective tax rate for 2014 was also impacted by an enacted tax rate decrease in Spain, tax losses related to functional currency differences and the impact of our foreign operations being taxed at lower statutory tax rates.\nValuation Allowances\nIn 2015, we recorded a net valuation allowance reversal of $1 million related to certain foreign loss carryforwards, which impacted the effective tax rate for the year. In 2014, we recorded a net valuation allowance of $7 million, mainly related to foreign loss carryforwards, which impacted the effective tax rate for the year.\nSEGMENT REVIEW\nPulp and Paper\nSales in our Pulp and Paper segment decreased by $219 million, or 5% when compared to sales in 2015. This decrease in sales is mostly due to a 3% decrease in net average selling prices for pulp and paper as well as a decrease in our paper sales volumes, partially offset by an increase in our pulp sales volumes of approximately 2%.\nOperating income in our Pulp and Paper segment amounted to $217 million in 2016, a decrease of $53 million, when compared to operating income of $270 million in 2015. Our results were negatively impacted by:\n \u2022 Lower average selling prices for paper and pulp ($135 million) \n \u2022 Lower volume and mix ($30 million) mostly related to lower volume of paper partially offset by higher volume of pulp \n \u2022 Higher restructuring costs mostly related to the conversion at Ashdown described above and the closure of a pulp dryer and idling of related assets at our Plymouth mill, related to our plan to optimize fluff pulp manufacturing ($28 million) \n \u2022 Higher other income/expense ($13 million) mostly due to net gain on sale of property, plant and equipment in 2015 \nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n \u2022 Lower depreciation charges ($59 million) due to lower accelerated depreciation related to our 2014 decision to convert a paper machine at our Ashdown facility to a high quality fluff pulp line and lower depreciation expenses due to certain assets reaching the end of their useful lives \n \u2022 Positive impact of a weaker Canadian dollar on our Canadian denominated expenses, net of our hedging program ($44 million) \n \u2022 Lower input costs ($44 million) mostly related to lower fiber and energy costs due to improved market and weather conditions \n \u2022 Lower operating expenses ($6 million) mostly related to lower freight costs due to favorable global economic factors including excess vessel capacity, carrier consolidation and lower oil prices as well as lower maintenance costs due to timing of major maintenance when compared to 2015 and reduced scope of outages and cost control measures, partially offset by lower productivity \nSales in 2015 in our Pulp and Paper segment decreased by $216 million, or 5% when compared to sales in 2014. This decrease in sales is mostly due to a 5% decrease in net average selling prices for pulp and paper. Total sales volume and foreign exchange were flat when compared to 2014.\nOperating income in 2015 in our Pulp and Paper segment amounted to $270 million, a decrease of $82 million, when compared to operating income of $352 million in 2014. Our results were negatively impacted by:\n \u2022 Lower average selling prices for paper and pulp ($211 million) \n \u2022 Higher depreciation charges ($61 million) due to higher accelerated depreciation related to our 2014 decision to convert a paper machine at our Ashdown facility to a high quality fluff pulp line, partially offset by lower depreciation expenses due to certain assets reaching the end of their useful lives \n \u2022 Lower other income/expense ($6 million) due to proceeds from insurance claims on machinery and equipment in 2014, increase in bad debt expense as well as other expenses, partially"}
