The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited (and unaudited) financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this prospectus. All dollar amounts in this registration statement refer to U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated.\nOverview\nOn September 27, 2013, the Company closed a reverse take-over transaction pursuant to which it acquired a private company whose principal activities are the trading of products, providing representation, and provision of consulting services to various industries. Pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement between the Company and Amplerissimo Ltd. (\"Amplerissimo\"), a company incorporated in Cyprus, we acquired 100% of Amplerissimo's issued and outstanding common stock. On November 14, 2013, we changed our name to Cosmos Holdings Inc. and changed our focus and business strategy to the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry.\nThe Company, through its subsidiaries, is operating within the pharmaceutical industry and in order to compete successfully in the healthcare industry, must demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits as well as cost advantages. Currently, most of the products that the Company is trading, compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category, and are subject to potential competition from new products that competitors may introduce in the future.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to comprehensive government regulations. Many factors may significantly affect the Company's sales of its products, including, but not limited to, efficacy, safety, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance as well as our research and development of new products.\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>17 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are currently focusing our existing operations on expanding the business of our subsidiaries, SkyPharm (Greece) and Decahedron (UK), in order to become an international pharmaceutical company. The Company's focus will be on Branded Pharmaceuticals, Over-the-Counter (OTC) medicines, and Generic Pharmaceuticals. The Company also intends to expand into Cosmetic-Beauty Products as well as Food Supplements and targets areas where we can build and maintain a strong position. The Company has already created its own line of vitamins and food supplement products under the brand name Sky Life Premium and targets areas where it can build and maintain a strong position. The Company uses a differentiated operating model based on a lean, nimble and decentralized structure, with an emphasis on acquisitions of established companies and our ability to maintain better pharmaceutical assets than others. This operating model and the execution of our corporate strategy are designed to enable the Company to achieve sustainable growth and create added value for our shareholders. In particular, we look to enhance our pharmaceutical and over-the-counter product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluate selective company acquisition opportunities.\nAs of July 22, 2015, the Hellenic Ministry of Health and more specifically the National Organization for Medicines granted the license for the wholesale of pharmaceutical products for human use to SkyPharm. The license is valid for a period of five years and pursuant to the EU directive of (2013/C 343/01) the Company is subject to fulfill the Guidelines of the Good Distribution Practices of medical products for human use. The Company has already incorporated the methodologies, procedures, processes and resources in order to be in accordance with the guidelines of the Good Distribution Practices. In 2016, the Company leased and equipped additional office space for our subsidiary SkyPharm in Thessaloniki, Greece in order to facilitate its growing business activity. The warehouse was already equipped with the proper shelves, working tables, medicine, cold fridge and barcode machines in compliance with all regulations.\nOn May 20, 2016, the Company entered into a Non-Binding Memorandum of Understanding with Doc Pharma SA to purchase the company for a combination of cash and stock to be agreed upon. Doc Pharma S.A is considered a related party to the Company due to the fact that the CEO of Doc Pharma is the wife of Grigorios Siokas, the Company's CEO and principal shareholder, who also served as a principal of Doc Pharma SA in the past. Doc Pharma is a pharmaceutical manufacturer with production facilities in Athens, Greece, certified under Good Manufacturer Practices (GMP). The company owns numerous licenses of generic medicines and uses its own network of pharmaceutical sales representatives to communicate its products with doctors. The company also trades prototype medicines, food supplements and cosmetics. Closing of the transaction is subject to execution of definitive exchange agreements, a full audit of Doc Pharma, satisfactory completion of due diligence of Doc Pharma, tax and legal consideration and other customary closing conditions. The Memorandum of Understanding expired on December 31, 2016, and has not been formally renewed or extended, however is being pursued.\nThe following significant events and transactions occurred during 2018 and through the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\nThe Company for the period ended December 31, 2018 has recorded total revenues of $37,083,882 with costs of revenues of $34,675,242 and has incurred operating expenses of approximately $3,637,062 in connection with these operations. The Company borrowed an aggregate of approximately $6,400,000 in loans as of December 31, 2018.\nOn November 17, 2016, Cosmos Holdings Inc. entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Decahedron SPA\u201d) with Decahedron and the shareholders of Decahedron. The Company consummated this transaction on February 10, 2017. The terms of the Decahedron SPA provided that the Company would acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Decahedron. In exchange for the shares of Decahedron, the Company will issue to the Decahedron shareholders an aggregate amount of 170,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The Decahedron SPA provided that following the closing of the transaction, the principal and majority shareholder of Decahedron, Nicholas Lazarou would be retained as a Director and COO of Decahedron with a salary of 10,000 GBP per month (approximately US $12,270).\nAs of October 3, 2017, the Company, entered into a Research & Development agreement with Doc Pharma S.A., a pharmaceutical manufacturer with production facilities in Athens, Greece, certified under Good Manufacturer Practices (GMP). The agreement outlines the development and contract manufacturing of Cosmos Holdings' complete line of Nutraceutical Products. Under the agreement, Doc Pharma S.A. will provide its services to research, develop formulation, complete product registration, design product packaging, and provide market-ready products. Sale of food supplements by the Company commenced in September 2018. Sales of the Company's own line started in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>18 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn November 15, 2017, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA\u201d) with certain institutional investors (the Buyers\u201d) with which it had no prior relationship, pursuant to which the Company issued for a purchase price of $3,000,000, $3,350,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Convertible Notes (the Notes\u201d) to the Buyers, convertible into 670,000 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.001 per share (the Common Stock\u201d) at $5,00 per share and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 536,000 shares of Common Stock exercisable at $7.50 per share (the Warrants\u201d.)\nOn August 25, 2017, we received shareholder and board approval for a reverse stock split of our common stock on the basis of issuing one (1) share of common stock in exchange for each ten (10) shares of common stock issued and outstanding. On November 21, 2017, the reverse stock split was made affective by FINRA. On November 21, 2017, the Company effected a one-for-ten (1:10) reverse stock split whereby the Company decreased, by a ratio of one-for-ten (1:10) the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. Proportional adjustments for the reverse stock split were made to the Company's outstanding stock options, and warrants including all share and per-share data, for all amounts and periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. All share and per share date in this Report gave retroactive effect to the reverse stock split unless otherwise noted.\nOn September 4, 2018, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA\u201d) and completed the financing with two institutional investors who had previously purchased $3,350,000 principal amount of senior convertible notes in November 2017 (the November Notes\u201d) as amended in February 2018 and September 2018. The Company issued, for a $2,000,000 purchase price, $2,233,333 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Convertible Notes (the Notes\u201d) convertible into 372,223 shares of Common Stock at $6.00 per share and five-year Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 357,334 shares of common stock exercisable at $7.50 per share. The Company received net proceeds of $1,845,000 after deduction of offering costs. See Debt Obligations - Senior Convertible Notes\u201d below.\nOn September 30, 2018, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement ( SPA\u201d) with Abbydale Management Limited, an unaffiliated third party incorporated in Belize. The Company sold one hundred (100%) percent of the issued share capital of its subsidiary, Amplerissimo Ltd., a limited liability company organized under the laws of Cypress, to the purchaser for a purchase price of \u20ac5,000 ($5,811). Amplerissimo had previously transferred one hundred (100%) percent of the capital stock of Sky Pharm SA to the Company. The information technology business of Amplerissimo is not a priority of the Company and the Company decided to not pursue such business.\nAcquisition - Cosmofarm Ltd.\nOn December 19, 2018, the Company completed the purchase of all of the capital stock of Cosmofarm Ltd., a pharmaceutical wholesaler based in Athens, Greece. The principal of the selling shareholder is Panagiotis Kozaris, who remained with Cosmofarm as a director and chief operating officer once it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Grigorios Siokas, the Company's CEO, became the new CEO of Cosmofarm. Mr. Kozaris had no prior relationship to the Company other than as an independent shareholder. The purchase price payable is \u20ac200,000 evidenced by a promissory note. Closing of the acquisition was subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence, delivery of audited and interim financial statements of Cosmofarm subject to being audited by PCAOB auditors, no material adverse change in the business or financial condition of Cosmofarm, all necessary consents and approvals to complete the acquisition have been obtained and other customary closing conditions.\nCosmofarm's primary activity as a pharmaceutical wholesaler is the distribution of pharmaceuticals (mainly prescription), OTC products and nutraceuticals to a growing network of over 320 pharmacies and 14 wholesalers primarily located in the greater Athens, Greece region. Cosmofarm consistently invests in upgrading automation capacity. Cosmofarm operates a fully automated ROWA (German pharmacy robotics) robotic warehouse system that ensures 0% error selection rate and accelerates the distribution process while ensuring higher cost-efficiency from local competitors. To boost cost-efficiency and better facilitate its growing operations, the Company is in the process of relocating to a larger building. Cosmofarm also seeks to expand its current operations automation investments by acquiring fully-integrated order management systems and additional robotic logistics over equipment.\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>19 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFlexible/adaptive credit policies is a major differentiator in capturing additional pharmacies. By methodically screening clients and closely managing cash flow, Cosmofarm has been able to grow its network while keeping debt levels low. In yielding high cost-efficiency, automated warehouse management systems enables the company to be in a position to choose to offer discounts in a growing customer network. Cosmofarm actively targets and captures pharmacies that achieve high-volume sales of OTC products and nutraceuticals which are among the fastest growing categories.\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2018 versus December 31, 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company had a net loss of $9,060,658 on revenue of $37,083,882, versus a net loss of $6,209,768 on revenue of $30,013,378, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenue\nRevenue during the Company's twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018, increased by 24% as compared to revenues in the period ended December 31, 2017. This increase is mainly because of the organic growth attributed to our subsidiary, SkyPharm, which continued the development of sales even more aggressively during the year ended December 31, 2018, as well as through the additional revenue from our subsidiary, Decahedron, based in the United Kingdom of England.\nOur future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends, including drug utilization, the introduction of new innovative brand therapies, the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers and the rate of conversion from brand products to those generic drugs, price increases and price deflation, general economic conditions in the member states of European Union, competition within the industry, customer consolidation, changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices, increased downward pressure on government and other third party reimbursement rates to our customers, and changes in government rules and regulations.\nCost of Revenue\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we had direct costs of revenue of $34,675,242 associated to cost of goods sold versus $28,057,111 from the prior fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Cost of revenue year over year increased by 24%.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $2,408,640 compared with the $1,956,267 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Gross profit increased by $452,373 or 23% from the prior fiscal year. The increase in the gross profit was primarily due to the increase of Company's main revenue source of trading, sourcing and distribution of pharmaceutical products.\nOperating Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had general and administrative costs of $3,593,132 and depreciation and amortization expense of $43,930 for a net operating loss of $1,228,422. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had general and administrative costs of $4,852,801, depreciation and amortization expense of $25,903 and goodwill impairment of $1,949,884 for a net operating loss of $4,872,321\nThe approximate 47% decrease in operating expenses in the year ended December 31, 2018, versus the prior year ended, is primarily due to the acquisition of Decahedron and the fact that 100% of the goodwill acquired, or $1,949,884, was fully impaired in the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, there was a 78% decrease in consulting expenses primarily due to the Company having expensed $1,137,793 in prepaid consulting and advisory fees in the year ended December 31, 2017. Consulting, auditing and accounting expenses consistently constitute a critical bulk of operating costs for the activities of the Company.\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>20 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had interest expense of $967,824, non-cash interest expenses of $5,839,581 related to the fair value of warrants for services, extinguishment of debt and the amortization of debt discount and $264 of interest related to loans from related parties versus the year ending December 31, 2017 where we had interest expense of $748,474, non-cash interest expenses of $886,483 related to the fair value of warrants for services and the amortization of debt discount and $2,592 of interest related to loans from related parties.\nUnrealized Foreign Currency losses\nAdditionally, we had an unrealized foreign currency translation gain of $1,418,057 for the year ended December 31, 2018 such that our net comprehensive loss for the period was $7,642,601 versus the unrealized foreign currency loss of $334,766 such that our net comprehensive loss for the period was $6,544,534 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nGoing Concern\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a net loss of $9,060,658 for the year ended December 31, 2018, and had an accumulated deficit of $16,272,645 as of December 31, 2018. The Company has not yet established an adequate ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease development of operations.\nIn order to continue as a going concern, develop a reliable source of revenues, and achieve a profitable level of operations the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management's plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through increased sales of product and by sale of common shares. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had a working capital deficit of $3,927,074 versus a working capital deficit of $4,192,984 as of December 31, 2017. This decrease in the working capital deficit is primarily attributed to the Company's investment in ICC (f/k/a KBB) in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had net cash of $864,343 versus $782,853 as of December 31, 2017. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in operating activities was $1,155,306 versus $8,760,141 net cash used in operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The Company has devoted substantially all of its cash resources to apply its investment program to expand through organic business growth and, where appropriate, the execution on selective company and license acquisitions, and incurred significant general and administrative expenses to enable it to finance and grow its business and operations.\nDuring the twelve months period ended December 31, 2018, there was $195,772 net cash used in investing activities versus $14,479 used in during the year ended December 31, 2017. This was primarily due to the increased purchase of fixed assets by SkyPharm and Cosmofarm offset by cash received in the acquisition of Cosmofarm.\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>21 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the twelve months period ended December 31, 2018, there was $1,988,302 of net cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities versus $9,291,089 provided by financing activities during the twelve months period ended December 31, 2017.\nWe believe that our current cash in our bank account and working capital as of December 31, 2018 will satisfy our estimated operating cash requirements for the next twelve months. However, the Company will require additional financing in fiscal year 2019 in order to continue at its expected level of operations and potential acquisitions. If the Company is unable to raise additional funds in the future on acceptable terms, or at all, it may be forced to curtail its development activities.\nWe anticipate using cash in our bank account as of December 31, 2018, cash generated from the operations of the Company and its operating subsidiaries and from debt or equity financing, or from loans from management, to the extent that funds are available to do so to conduct our business in the upcoming year. Management is not obligated to provide these or any other funds.\nDebt Obligations\nLoan Facility\nOn August 4, 2016, SkyPharm entered into a Loan Facility Agreement, last amended on April 18, 2018, with Synthesis Peer-To-Peer Income Fund (the Loan Facility\u201d and the Lender\u201d).

As of the date of this prospectus, no such event of default has occurred. Subject to the Blocker (as defined below), the Company pre-delivered up to 372,223 shares of common stock to the holders. Eighty-five percent (85%) of any cash proceeds received by the holders of the Notes from the sale of pre-delivery shares issued as collateral shall be applied against the particular installment amount then due. The Notes are pari passu in right of payment to the November Notes and senior to all existing and future indebtedness except Permitted Indebtedness which includes $12 million of senior secured indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries under an existing loan agreement described herein, plus defined amount of purchase money indebtedness in connection with bona fide acquisitions.\nIn the event of an issuance of common stock for a consideration less than the Conversion Price (other than Excluded Securities, as defined) the Conversion Price shall be reduced to the price of the dilutive issuance (the Conversion Price\u201d).

The Company valued the beneficial conversion feature at intrinsic value and has recorded $934,922 to debt discount, which will be amortized over the life of the Notes.\nEvents of Default, none of which have occurred as of the date of this prospectus, are defined under the Notes to include among others: (i) failure to pay principal, interest, late charges or any other amounts when due after any applicable cure period, under the Notes or any other instrument delivered in connection with the transaction; (ii) any default of at least $75,000 of indebtedness other than with respect to the Note and/or the entry of a final judgment concerning the foregoing; (iii) any bankruptcy, liquidation or other similar proceeding not dismissed within thirty (30) days of its initiation, or any voluntary bankruptcy or similar proceeding commenced by the Company or any subsidiary, or an admission in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due; (iv) the entry by a court of a decree, order, judgment or similar document in respect of the Company or any subsidiary of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or similar proceeding; (v) any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or other term or condition of any document in connection with this transaction except if curable, the breach remains uncured for two consecutive trading days; (vi) a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the SPA) occurs; (vii) failure to meet filing and effectiveness deadlines concerning this registration statement; (viii) failure to convert the Notes or deliver underlying common stock on a timely basis; (ix) suspension from trading or listing of the common stock for five consecutive trading days; (x) failure to reserve at least 150% of the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes and/or exercise of the Warrants; and (xi) any Event of Default occurs with respect to the November Notes which was exchanged in February for new notes.\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>25 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Notes provide that upon an Event of Default, the Buyers may require the Company to redeem (regardless of whether the Event of Default has been cured) all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption premium of one hundred twenty-five (125%) percent, multiplied by the greater of the conversion rate and the then current market price. The Buyers may also require redemption of the Notes upon a Change of Control (as defined) at a premium of one hundred twenty-five (125%) percent.\nThe Warrants have a five-year term and are exercisable into 357,334 shares of common stock beginning May 1, 2019 or six months after the issue date.

The Company calculated the warrants at relative fair value of approximately $910,078, which was recognized as a discount to the Notes and is being amortized as interest expense over the remaining term of the Notes.\nConversion of the Notes and exercise of the Warrants are each subject to a blocker provision which prevents any holder from converting or exercising, as applicable, the Notes or the Warrants, into shares of common stock if its beneficial ownership of the common stock would exceed 9.99% of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock (each, a Blocker\u201d).\nA registration statement (No. 333-227813), covering one hundred fifty (150%) percent of the maximum number of shares, underlying the Notes and Warrants, was declared effective by the SEC on November 1, 2018.\nAs a condition to the closing of the Financing, each Buyer, severally, executed a leak-out agreement (each, a Leak-Out Agreement\u201d) restricting such Buyer's sale of shares of common stock underlying the Notes and Warrants on any Trading Day to not more than such Buyer's pro rata allocation of the greater of (x) sales with net proceeds of an aggregate of $20,000 or (y) twenty-five (25%) percent of the daily average trading volume of the Company's common stock. If after the closing of the Financing there is no Event of Default under the Notes, the VWAP of the Company's common stock for three (3) trading days is less than $1.50 per share, the Company may further restrict the Buyers from selling at less than $1.50 per share; provided that the portion of the Notes subject to redemption on each Installment Date shall thereafter double.\nRoth Capital Partners, LLC ( Roth\u201d), as the Company's exclusive placement agent received a cash commission for this transaction of $140,000, equal to seven (7%) percent of the total gross proceeds of the offering and the issuance of five-year warrants to purchase seven (7%) percent of the shares of common stock issued or issuable in this offering (excluding shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of any Warrants issued to investors, or 26,056 shares); however, will receive seven (7%) percent of any cash proceeds received from the exercise of any Warrants sold in the offering with an expiration equal to or less than twenty-four (24) months.

Our organic growth would be driven by entering into new markets and areas where we can sell and distribute a more profitable series of pharmaceutical product and over the counter products and nutraceuticals. We are committed to capitalizing on sales growth opportunities by increasing our customer pipeline across the European Market and entering into countries outside the European Union.\nWe are also committed to pursuing various forms of business development; this can include trading, alliances, licenses, joint ventures, dispositions and acquisitions. Moreover, we hope to continue to build on our portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expand our product pipeline to generic and nutraceutical products. Thus, we plan to formulate a sound sales distribution network specializing in generic as well as in cosmetics and food supplement products.\nOur main objective is expanding the business operations of our current subsidiaries, SkyPharm and Decahedron by concentrating our efforts on becoming an international manufacturing, trading and distribution pharmaceutical company. The Company's focus is on branded pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, and generics, with plans to expand its food supplements and to target areas where we can build and maintain a strong position.\nThrough our subsidiary, Decahedron, we plan to penetrate into the English pharmaceutical market and expand our wholesale networks. We could utilize the ability of trading pharmaceutical products in and out of the English market according to the FX currency exchange rate of euro to English pounds.\nWe view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate earnings growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities. Under these principles we assess our businesses and assets as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and continue to consider trading development activities for our businesses.\nThe Company, in the following twelve months, intends to start its business operation within the food supplements market, as well as substantially grow its business operations within the generic pharmaceutical products market. These industries are highly competitive and may significantly affect the Company's sales of these products, including, but not limited to, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance.\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of pharmaceutical and healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of doctor visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage, may impact the Company's business.\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>28 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to expanding our product portfolio we also plan to evaluate offering our products and services to different geographical markets. We are currently focused on to our customers throughout the European Union. We plan on expanding our geographical reach to new eras outside the European Union market, although we currently have no binding agreements, commitments or contracts in any of these geographical markets. Some of the methods we will use to accomplish this are: promoting our brand and marketing our products and services through the Internet to new geographic areas, creating strategic relationships with companies in the new geographical regions, and possibly acquiring companies that operate in new geographical regions. We anticipate that we will spend $70,000 evaluating the different methods and regions to which we plan to expand. This cost is made of up primarily legal fees, consulting fees, accounting and auditing fees as well as related development expenses. We assess the foreseeable development of a target as being positive.\nWe expect to continue growing through expansion into adjacent products, product categories and channels, as well as through entry into new geographic markets. We evaluate potential acquisition targets based on whether they have the capacity to deliver a return on invested capital.\nAs to potential acquisitions, we are targeting companies that are operating primarily in the pharmaceutical sector and within the European Union boarders. SEC filing requirements are such that we will have to file audited financial statements of all our operations, including any acquired business. So, we plan that our first step in any potential acquisition process we undertake is to ascertain whether we can obtain audited financials of a company if we were to acquire them. We anticipate that we will spend approximately $500,000 to locate, conduct due diligence, and evaluate possible acquisitions. As noted above, as of the date of this report, we do not have any binding agreements, commitments, or understandings with any potential acquisition candidates.\nThe pharmaceutical sector offers a large growth potential within the European pharmaceutical market, if service, price and quality are strictly directed to-wards the customer requirements. We will continue to encounter the competition in the market by product, service, reliability and a high level of quality. On the procurement side we can access a wide range of supply possibilities. To minimize business risks we diversify our sources of supply all over Europe. We secure our high-quality demands through careful supplier qualification and selection as well as active suppliers' system management.\nWe assess the foreseeable development of the Company as being positive. Over the medium term we assume that we will be able to further expand our market shares. However, during the course of further organizational optimization there may be associated extraordinary additional costs.\nWe still see the risks for the future development in a difficult and competitive environment, increasing purchase prices and the stagnating selling price level. On the background of our financial stability we however see ourselves as being well-equipped for managing the future risks. Risks that could endanger the survival of the Company are currently not able to be identified.\nWe will evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand our businesses through the acquisition of products and companies in areas that will serve patients and customers and that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins. In particular, we are looking to continue to enhance our product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluate selective acquisition and license opportunities. In addition, we remain committed to strategic R&D across each business unit with a particular focus on assets with inherently lower risk profiles and clearly defined governmental regulatory pathways.\nSignificant Equipment\nWe do not intend to purchase any significant equipment for the next twelve months aside from a few pieces of IT equipment. Nevertheless, we will replace essential equipment for operations if it is required within the year.\nEmployees\nIn order to achieve our strategic objectives, we have, and will remain, focused on hiring and retaining a highly skilled management team that has extensive experience and specific skill sets relating to the sales, selection, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. We intend to continue our efforts to build and expand this team as we grow our business. We have plans to increase the number of our employees by adding more sales people during the next twelve months.\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>29 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company adopted the modified retrospective adoption in accordance with ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, on January 1, 2018. The new guidance introduces a five-step model for recognizing revenue by applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract with the customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring the promised goods to the customer. Once these steps are met, revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product. Adoption of ASC 606 has not changed the timing and nature of the Company's revenue recognition and there has been no material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most \"critical accounting polices\" in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a \"critical accounting policy\" is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results, and requires management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nForeign Currency. The Company requires translation of the Amplerissimo financial statements from euros to dollars since the reverse take-over on September 27, 2013. Assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated at year-end rates of exchange, and the statements of operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity until the entity is sold or substantially liquidated. Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions (transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity's local currency) are included in net (loss) earnings.\nIncome Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, as required by the accounting standard for income taxes, ASC 740. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company is liable for income taxes in the Republics of Cyprus, Greece and the United Kingdom of England. The corporate income tax rate in Cyprus is 12.5%, 29% in Greece, (tax losses are carried forward for five years effective January 1, 2013 (prior to 2013, losses were carried forward indefinitely) and 20% in the United Kingdom of England. Losses may also be subject to limitation under certain rules regarding change of ownership.\nWe regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our review includes evaluating both positive (e.g., sources of taxable income) and negative (e.g., recent historical losses) evidence that could impact the realizability of our deferred tax assets.\nWe recognize the impact of an uncertain tax position in our financial statements if, in management's judgment, the position is not more-likely-then-not sustainable upon audit based on the position's technical merits. This involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions, the evaluation of applicable tax laws and an assessment of whether a liability for an uncertain tax position is necessary. We operate and are subject to audit in multiple taxing jurisdictions.\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>30 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe record interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of interest and other expense, respectively.\nPotential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company has adopted ASC 740 \"Accounting for Income Taxes\" as of its inception. Pursuant to ASC 740, the Company is required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried forward. The potential benefits of net operating losses have not been recognized in this financial statement because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future years.\nThe Company has net operating loss carry-forwards in our parent, Cosmos Holdings Inc., which are applicable to future taxable income in the United States (if any). Additionally, the Company has income tax liabilities in the Republic of Cyprus. The income tax assets and liabilities are not able to be netted. We therefore reserve the income tax assets applicable to the United States, but recognize the income tax liabilities in the Republic of Cyprus.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities and ASU 2018-03, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\u201d ASU 2016-01 contained a number of changes which are applicable to the Company including the following: (1) requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; and (2) allows equity investments without readily determinable fair values to be measured at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus changes in observable prices (referred to as the measurement alternative\u201d); ASU 2018-03 also clarified certain aspects of the guidance issued in ASU 2016-01, including requiring a prospective transition approach for equity investments without readily determinable fair value in which the measurement alternative is applied. ASU 2016-01 does not apply to investments accounted for using the equity method, investments in consolidated subsidiaries, FHLB stock, and investments in low income housing tax credit projects. The ASU also eliminated the requirement to classify equity investments into different categories such as Available-for-sale.\u201d The adoption of this standard on did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), which simplifies the measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the current goodwill impairment test in the event that there is evidence of an impairment based on qualitative or quantitative assessments. ASU 2017-04 does not change how the goodwill impairment is identified, and the Company will continue to perform a qualitative assessment annually to determine whether the two-step impairment test is required. Until the adoption, current accounting standards require the impairment loss to be recognized under Step 2 of the impairment test. This requires the Company to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning fair value to the reporting unit's assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit has been acquired in a business combination, then subsequently subtracting the implied goodwill from the carrying amount of the goodwill. The new standard would require the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and subtract the carrying value from the fair value of the reporting unit to determine if there is an impairment. ASU 2017-04 is effective for the Company for fiscal years after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted. ASU 2017-04 is required to be adopted prospectively, and the adoption is effective for annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the year of adoption. The adoption of this standard on did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business,\u201d with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as an acquisition of assets or a business. ASU No. 2017-01 is effective for the Company's fiscal year commencing on January 1, 2018. The effect of this guidance is to be applied prospectively and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU No. 2017-01 did have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or the Company's consolidated results of operations.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases,\u201d which will require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by most leases on the balance sheet. The changes become effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020. Modified retrospective adoption for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, is required with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company expects this ASU will increase its current assets and current liabilities but have no net material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.", "summary": "The report discusses the operations and financial condition of Cosmos Holdings Inc.

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited (and unaudited) financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this prospectus. All dollar amounts in this registration statement refer to U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated.\nOverview\nOn September 27, 2013, the Company closed a reverse take-over transaction pursuant to which it acquired a private company whose principal activities are the trading of products, providing representation, and provision of consulting services to various industries. Pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement between the Company and Amplerissimo Ltd. (\"Amplerissimo\"), a company incorporated in Cyprus, we acquired 100% of Amplerissimo's issued and outstanding common stock. On November 14, 2013, we changed our name to Cosmos Holdings Inc. and changed our focus and business strategy to the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry.\nThe Company, through its subsidiaries, is operating within the pharmaceutical industry and in order to compete successfully in the healthcare industry, must demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits as well as cost advantages. Currently, most of the products that the Company is trading, compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category, and are subject to potential competition from new products that competitors may introduce in the future.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to comprehensive government regulations. Many factors may significantly affect the Company's sales of its products, including, but not limited to, efficacy, safety, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance as well as our research and development of new products.\n\nWe are currently focusing our existing operations on expanding the business of our subsidiaries, SkyPharm (Greece) and Decahedron (UK), in order to become an international pharmaceutical company. The Company's focus will be on Branded Pharmaceuticals, Over-the-Counter (OTC) medicines, and Generic Pharmaceuticals. The Company also intends to expand into Cosmetic-Beauty Products as well as Food Supplements and targets areas where we can build and maintain a strong position. The Company has already created its own line of vitamins and food supplement products under the brand name Sky Life Premium and targets areas where it can build and maintain a strong position. The Company uses a differentiated operating model based on a lean, nimble and decentralized structure, with an emphasis on acquisitions of established companies and our ability to maintain better pharmaceutical assets than others. This operating model and the execution of our corporate strategy are designed to enable the Company to achieve sustainable growth and create added value for our shareholders. In particular, we look to enhance our pharmaceutical and over-the-counter product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluate selective company acquisition opportunities.\nAs of July 22, 2015, the Hellenic Ministry of Health and more specifically the National Organization for Medicines granted the license for the wholesale of pharmaceutical products for human use to SkyPharm. The license is valid for a period of five years and pursuant to the EU directive of (2013/C 343/01) the Company is subject to fulfill the Guidelines of the Good Distribution Practices of medical products for human use. The Company has already incorporated the methodologies, procedures, processes and resources in order to be in accordance with the guidelines of the Good Distribution Practices. In 2016, the Company leased and equipped additional office space for our subsidiary SkyPharm in Thessaloniki, Greece in order to facilitate its growing business activity. The warehouse was already equipped with the proper shelves, working tables, medicine, cold fridge and barcode machines in compliance with all regulations.\nOn May 20, 2016, the Company entered into a Non-Binding Memorandum of Understanding with Doc Pharma SA to purchase the company for a combination of cash and stock to be agreed upon. Doc Pharma S.A is considered a related party to the Company due to the fact that the CEO of Doc Pharma is the wife of Grigorios Siokas, the Company's CEO and principal shareholder, who also served as a principal of Doc Pharma SA in the past. Doc Pharma is a pharmaceutical manufacturer with production facilities in Athens, Greece, certified under Good Manufacturer Practices (GMP). The company owns numerous licenses of generic medicines and uses its own network of pharmaceutical sales representatives to communicate its products with doctors. The company also trades prototype medicines, food supplements and cosmetics. Closing of the transaction is subject to execution of definitive exchange agreements, a full audit of Doc Pharma, satisfactory completion of due diligence of Doc Pharma, tax and legal consideration and other customary closing conditions. The Memorandum of Understanding expired on December 31, 2016, and has not been formally renewed or extended, however is being pursued.\nThe following significant events and transactions occurred during 2018 and through the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\nThe Company for the period ended December 31, 2018 has recorded total revenues of $37,083,882 with costs of revenues of $34,675,242 and has incurred operating expenses of approximately $3,637,062 in connection with these operations. The Company borrowed an aggregate of approximately $6,400,000 in loans as of December 31, 2018.\nOn November 17, 2016, Cosmos Holdings Inc. entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Decahedron SPA\u201d) with Decahedron and the shareholders of Decahedron. The Company consummated this transaction on February 10, 2017. The terms of the Decahedron SPA provided that the Company would acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Decahedron. In exchange for the shares of Decahedron, the Company will issue to the Decahedron shareholders an aggregate amount of 170,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The Decahedron SPA provided that following the closing of the transaction, the principal and majority shareholder of Decahedron, Nicholas Lazarou would be retained as a Director and COO of Decahedron with a salary of 10,000 GBP per month (approximately US $12,270).\nAs of October 3, 2017, the Company, entered into a Research & Development agreement with Doc Pharma S.A., a pharmaceutical manufacturer with production facilities in Athens, Greece, certified under Good Manufacturer Practices (GMP). The agreement outlines the development and contract manufacturing of Cosmos Holdings' complete line of Nutraceutical Products. Under the agreement, Doc Pharma S.A. will provide its services to research, develop formulation, complete product registration, design product packaging, and provide market-ready products. Sale of food supplements by the Company commenced in September 2018. Sales of the Company's own line started in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n\nOn November 15, 2017, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA\u201d) with certain institutional investors (the Buyers\u201d) with which it had no prior relationship, pursuant to which the Company issued for a purchase price of $3,000,000, $3,350,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Convertible Notes (the Notes\u201d) to the Buyers, convertible into 670,000 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.001 per share (the Common Stock\u201d) at $5,00 per share and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 536,000 shares of Common Stock exercisable at $7.50 per share (the Warrants\u201d.)\nOn August 25, 2017, we received shareholder and board approval for a reverse stock split of our common stock on the basis of issuing one (1) share of common stock in exchange for each ten (10) shares of common stock issued and outstanding. On November 21, 2017, the reverse stock split was made affective by FINRA. On November 21, 2017, the Company effected a one-for-ten (1:10) reverse stock split whereby the Company decreased, by a ratio of one-for-ten (1:10) the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. Proportional adjustments for the reverse stock split were made to the Company's outstanding stock options, and warrants including all share and per-share data, for all amounts and periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. All share and per share date in this Report gave retroactive effect to the reverse stock split unless otherwise noted.\nOn September 4, 2018, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA\u201d) and completed the financing with two institutional investors who had previously purchased $3,350,000 principal amount of senior convertible notes in November 2017 (the November Notes\u201d) as amended in February 2018 and September 2018. The Company issued, for a $2,000,000 purchase price, $2,233,333 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Convertible Notes (the Notes\u201d) convertible into 372,223 shares of Common Stock at $6.00 per share and five-year Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 357,334 shares of common stock exercisable at $7.50 per share. The Company received net proceeds of $1,845,000 after deduction of offering costs. See Debt Obligations - Senior Convertible Notes\u201d below.\nOn September 30, 2018, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement ( SPA\u201d) with Abbydale Management Limited, an unaffiliated third party incorporated in Belize. The Company sold one hundred (100%) percent of the issued share capital of its subsidiary, Amplerissimo Ltd., a limited liability company organized under the laws of Cypress, to the purchaser for a purchase price of \u20ac5,000 ($5,811). Amplerissimo had previously transferred one hundred (100%) percent of the capital stock of Sky Pharm SA to the Company. The information technology business of Amplerissimo is not a priority of the Company and the Company decided to not pursue such business.\nAcquisition - Cosmofarm Ltd.\nOn December 19, 2018, the Company completed the purchase of all of the capital stock of Cosmofarm Ltd., a pharmaceutical wholesaler based in Athens, Greece. The principal of the selling shareholder is Panagiotis Kozaris, who remained with Cosmofarm as a director and chief operating officer once it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Grigorios Siokas, the Company's CEO, became the new CEO of Cosmofarm. Mr. Kozaris had no prior relationship to the Company other than as an independent shareholder. The purchase price payable is \u20ac200,000 evidenced by a promissory note. Closing of the acquisition was subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence, delivery of audited and interim financial statements of Cosmofarm subject to being audited by PCAOB auditors, no material adverse change in the business or financial condition of Cosmofarm, all necessary consents and approvals to complete the acquisition have been obtained and other customary closing conditions.\nCosmofarm's primary activity as a pharmaceutical wholesaler is the distribution of pharmaceuticals (mainly prescription), OTC products and nutraceuticals to a growing network of over 320 pharmacies and 14 wholesalers primarily located in the greater Athens, Greece region. Cosmofarm consistently invests in upgrading automation capacity. Cosmofarm operates a fully automated ROWA (German pharmacy robotics) robotic warehouse system that ensures 0% error selection rate and accelerates the distribution process while ensuring higher cost-efficiency from local competitors. To boost cost-efficiency and better facilitate its growing operations, the Company is in the process of relocating to a larger building. Cosmofarm also seeks to expand its current operations automation investments by acquiring fully-integrated order management systems and additional robotic logistics over equipment.\n\nFlexible/adaptive credit policies is a major differentiator in capturing additional pharmacies. By methodically screening clients and closely managing cash flow, Cosmofarm has been able to grow its network while keeping debt levels low. In yielding high cost-efficiency, automated warehouse management systems enables the company to be in a position to choose to offer discounts in a growing customer network. Cosmofarm actively targets and captures pharmacies that achieve high-volume sales of OTC products and nutraceuticals which are among the fastest growing categories.\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2018 versus December 31, 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company had a net loss of $9,060,658 on revenue of $37,083,882, versus a net loss of $6,209,768 on revenue of $30,013,378, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenue\nRevenue during the Company's twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018, increased by 24% as compared to revenues in the period ended December 31, 2017. This increase is mainly because of the organic growth attributed to our subsidiary, SkyPharm, which continued the development of sales even more aggressively during the year ended December 31, 2018, as well as through the additional revenue from our subsidiary, Decahedron, based in the United Kingdom of England.\nOur future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends, including drug utilization, the introduction of new innovative brand therapies, the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers and the rate of conversion from brand products to those generic drugs, price increases and price deflation, general economic conditions in the member states of European Union, competition within the industry, customer consolidation, changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices, increased downward pressure on government and other third party reimbursement rates to our customers, and changes in government rules and regulations.\nCost of Revenue\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we had direct costs of revenue of $34,675,242 associated to cost of goods sold versus $28,057,111 from the prior fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Cost of revenue year over year increased by 24%.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $2,408,640 compared with the $1,956,267 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Gross profit increased by $452,373 or 23% from the prior fiscal year. The increase in the gross profit was primarily due to the increase of Company's main revenue source of trading, sourcing and distribution of pharmaceutical products.\nOperating Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had general and administrative costs of $3,593,132 and depreciation and amortization expense of $43,930 for a net operating loss of $1,228,422. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had general and administrative costs of $4,852,801, depreciation and amortization expense of $25,903 and goodwill impairment of $1,949,884 for a net operating loss of $4,872,321\nThe approximate 47% decrease in operating expenses in the year ended December 31, 2018, versus the prior year ended, is primarily due to the acquisition of Decahedron and the fact that 100% of the goodwill acquired, or $1,949,884, was fully impaired in the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, there was a 78% decrease in consulting expenses primarily due to the Company having expensed $1,137,793 in prepaid consulting and advisory fees in the year ended December 31, 2017. Consulting, auditing and accounting expenses consistently constitute a critical bulk of operating costs for the activities of the Company.\n\nInterest Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had interest expense of $967,824, non-cash interest expenses of $5,839,581 related to the fair value of warrants for services, extinguishment of debt and the amortization of debt discount and $264 of interest related to loans from related parties versus the year ending December 31, 2017 where we had interest expense of $748,474, non-cash interest expenses of $886,483 related to the fair value of warrants for services and the amortization of debt discount and $2,592 of interest related to loans from related parties.\nUnrealized Foreign Currency losses\nAdditionally, we had an unrealized foreign currency translation gain of $1,418,057 for the year ended December 31, 2018 such that our net comprehensive loss for the period was $7,642,601 versus the unrealized foreign currency loss of $334,766 such that our net comprehensive loss for the period was $6,544,534 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nGoing Concern\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a net loss of $9,060,658 for the year ended December 31, 2018, and had an accumulated deficit of $16,272,645 as of December 31, 2018. The Company has not yet established an adequate ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease development of operations.\nIn order to continue as a going concern, develop a reliable source of revenues, and achieve a profitable level of operations the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management's plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through increased sales of product and by sale of common shares. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had a working capital deficit of $3,927,074 versus a working capital deficit of $4,192,984 as of December 31, 2017. This decrease in the working capital deficit is primarily attributed to the Company's investment in ICC (f/k/a KBB) in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had net cash of $864,343 versus $782,853 as of December 31, 2017. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in operating activities was $1,155,306 versus $8,760,141 net cash used in operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The Company has devoted substantially all of its cash resources to apply its investment program to expand through organic business growth and, where appropriate, the execution on selective company and license acquisitions, and incurred significant general and administrative expenses to enable it to finance and grow its business and operations.\nDuring the twelve months period ended December 31, 2018, there was $195,772 net cash used in investing activities versus $14,479 used in during the year ended December 31, 2017. This was primarily due to the increased purchase of fixed assets by SkyPharm and Cosmofarm offset by cash received in the acquisition of Cosmofarm.\n\nDuring the twelve months period ended December 31, 2018, there was $1,988,302 of net cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities versus $9,291,089 provided by financing activities during the twelve months period ended December 31, 2017.\nWe believe that our current cash in our bank account and working capital as of December 31, 2018 will satisfy our estimated operating cash requirements for the next twelve months. However, the Company will require additional financing in fiscal year 2019 in order to continue at its expected level of operations and potential acquisitions. If the Company is unable to raise additional funds in the future on acceptable terms, or at all, it may be forced to curtail its development activities.\nWe anticipate using cash in our bank account as of December 31, 2018, cash generated from the operations of the Company and its operating subsidiaries and from debt or equity financing, or from loans from management, to the extent that funds are available to do so to conduct our business in the upcoming year. Management is not obligated to provide these or any other funds.\nDebt Obligations\nLoan Facility\nOn August 4, 2016, SkyPharm entered into a Loan Facility Agreement, last amended on April 18, 2018, with Synthesis Peer-To-Peer Income Fund (the Loan Facility\u201d and the Lender\u201d).

Pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement between the Company and Amplerissimo Ltd. (\"Amplerissimo\"), a company incorporated in Cyprus, we acquired 100% of Amplerissimo's issued and outstanding common stock. On November 14, 2013, we changed our name to Cosmos Holdings Inc. and changed our focus and business strategy to the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry.\nThe Company, through its subsidiaries, is operating within the pharmaceutical industry and in order to compete successfully in the healthcare industry, must demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits as well as cost advantages. Currently, most of the products that the Company is trading, compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category, and are subject to potential competition from new products that competitors may introduce in the future.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to comprehensive government regulations. Many factors may significantly affect the Company's sales of its products, including, but not limited to, efficacy, safety, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance as well as our research and development of new products.\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>17 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are currently focusing our existing operations on expanding the business of our subsidiaries, SkyPharm (Greece) and Decahedron (UK), in order to become an international pharmaceutical company. The Company's focus will be on Branded Pharmaceuticals, Over-the-Counter (OTC) medicines, and Generic Pharmaceuticals. The Company also intends to expand into Cosmetic-Beauty Products as well as Food Supplements and targets areas where we can build and maintain a strong position. The Company has already created its own line of vitamins and food supplement products under the brand name Sky Life Premium and targets areas where it can build and maintain a strong position. The Company uses a differentiated operating model based on a lean, nimble and decentralized structure, with an emphasis on acquisitions of established companies and our ability to maintain better pharmaceutical assets than others. This operating model and the execution of our corporate strategy are designed to enable the Company to achieve sustainable growth and create added value for our shareholders. In particular, we look to enhance our pharmaceutical and over-the-counter product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluate selective company acquisition opportunities.\nAs of July 22, 2015, the Hellenic Ministry of Health and more specifically the National Organization for Medicines granted the license for the wholesale of pharmaceutical products for human use to SkyPharm.

This increase is mainly because of the organic growth attributed to our subsidiary, SkyPharm, which continued the development of sales even more aggressively during the year ended December 31, 2018, as well as through the additional revenue from our subsidiary, Decahedron, based in the United Kingdom of England.\nOur future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends, including drug utilization, the introduction of new innovative brand therapies, the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers and the rate of conversion from brand products to those generic drugs, price increases and price deflation, general economic conditions in the member states of European Union, competition within the industry, customer consolidation, changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices, increased downward pressure on government and other third party reimbursement rates to our customers, and changes in government rules and regulations.\nCost of Revenue\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we had direct costs of revenue of $34,675,242 associated to cost of goods sold versus $28,057,111 from the prior fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Cost of revenue year over year increased by 24%.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $2,408,640 compared with the $1,956,267 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Gross profit increased by $452,373 or 23% from the prior fiscal year. The increase in the gross profit was primarily due to the increase of Company's main revenue source of trading, sourcing and distribution of pharmaceutical products.\nOperating Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had general and administrative costs of $3,593,132 and depreciation and amortization expense of $43,930 for a net operating loss of $1,228,422. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had general and administrative costs of $4,852,801, depreciation and amortization expense of $25,903 and goodwill impairment of $1,949,884 for a net operating loss of $4,872,321\nThe approximate 47% decrease in operating expenses in the year ended December 31, 2018, versus the prior year ended, is primarily due to the acquisition of Decahedron and the fact that 100% of the goodwill acquired, or $1,949,884, was fully impaired in the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, there was a 78% decrease in consulting expenses primarily due to the Company having expensed $1,137,793 in prepaid consulting and advisory fees in the year ended December 31, 2017. Consulting, auditing and accounting expenses consistently constitute a critical bulk of operating costs for the activities of the Company.\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>20 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had interest expense of $967,824, non-cash interest expenses of $5,839,581 related to the fair value of warrants for services, extinguishment of debt and the amortization of debt discount and $264 of interest related to loans from related parties versus the year ending December 31, 2017 where we had interest expense of $748,474, non-cash interest expenses of $886,483 related to the fair value of warrants for services and the amortization of debt discount and $2,592 of interest related to loans from related parties.\nUnrealized Foreign Currency losses\nAdditionally, we had an unrealized foreign currency translation gain of $1,418,057 for the year ended December 31, 2018 such that our net comprehensive loss for the period was $7,642,601 versus the unrealized foreign currency loss of $334,766 such that our net comprehensive loss for the period was $6,544,534 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nGoing Concern\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a net loss of $9,060,658 for the year ended December 31, 2018, and had an accumulated deficit of $16,272,645 as of December 31, 2018. The Company has not yet established an adequate ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease development of operations.\nIn order to continue as a going concern, develop a reliable source of revenues, and achieve a profitable level of operations the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management's plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through increased sales of product and by sale of common shares. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had a working capital deficit of $3,927,074 versus a working capital deficit of $4,192,984 as of December 31, 2017. This decrease in the working capital deficit is primarily attributed to the Company's investment in ICC (f/k/a KBB) in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had net cash of $864,343 versus $782,853 as of December 31, 2017. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in operating activities was $1,155,306 versus $8,760,141 net cash used in operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The Company has devoted substantially all of its cash resources to apply its investment program to expand through organic business growth and, where appropriate, the execution on selective company and license acquisitions, and incurred significant general and administrative expenses to enable it to finance and grow its business and operations.\nDuring the twelve months period ended December 31, 2018, there was $195,772 net cash used in investing activities versus $14,479 used in during the year ended December 31, 2017. This was primarily due to the increased purchase of fixed assets by SkyPharm and Cosmofarm offset by cash received in the acquisition of Cosmofarm.\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>21 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the twelve months period ended December 31, 2018, there was $1,988,302 of net cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities versus $9,291,089 provided by financing activities during the twelve months period ended December 31, 2017.\nWe believe that our current cash in our bank account and working capital as of December 31, 2018 will satisfy our estimated operating cash requirements for the next twelve months. However, the Company will require additional financing in fiscal year 2019 in order to continue at its expected level of operations and potential acquisitions. If the Company is unable to raise additional funds in the future on acceptable terms, or at all, it may be forced to curtail its development activities.\nWe anticipate using cash in our bank account as of December 31, 2018, cash generated from the operations of the Company and its operating subsidiaries and from debt or equity financing, or from loans from management, to the extent that funds are available to do so to conduct our business in the upcoming year. Management is not obligated to provide these or any other funds.\nDebt Obligations\nLoan Facility\nOn August 4, 2016, SkyPharm entered into a Loan Facility Agreement, last amended on April 18, 2018, with Synthesis Peer-To-Peer Income Fund (the Loan Facility\u201d and the Lender\u201d).
