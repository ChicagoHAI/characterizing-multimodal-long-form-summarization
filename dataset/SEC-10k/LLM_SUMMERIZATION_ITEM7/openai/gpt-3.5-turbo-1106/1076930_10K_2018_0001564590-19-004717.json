Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The MD&A contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, our belief that the Purchasing Managers Index ( PMI\u201d) may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial end market; our strategy; anticipated financial performance; expected liquidity and capitalization; drivers of revenue growth and our growth expectations in various markets; management's plans and objectives for future operations, expenditures and product development, and investments in research and development; business prospects; potential of future product releases and expansion of our product and service offerings; anticipated revenue performance; industry trends; market conditions; our competitive positions; changes in economic and political conditions; changes in accounting principles; changes in actual or assumed tax liabilities; expectations regarding tax exposures; anticipated reinvestment of future earnings and dividend policy; anticipated expenditures in regard to the Company's benefit plans; future acquisitions, integration and anticipated benefits from acquisitions and dispositions; anticipated economic benefits and expected costs of restructuring programs; ability to repay our indebtedness; our intentions regarding the use of cash; expectations regarding legal and regulatory environmental requirements and our compliance thereto; and other statements that are not historical facts. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading Risk Factors.\u201d The words anticipates,\u201d believes,\u201d expects,\u201d intends,\u201d future,\u201d could,\u201d estimates,\u201d plans,\u201d would,\u201d should,\u201d potential,\u201d continues,\u201d and similar words or expressions (as well as other words or expressions referencing future events, conditions or circumstances) identify forward looking statements. Readers should not place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Management and the Company disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in its expectations or in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those contained in the forward looking statements, except as required under applicable law.\nBusiness Overview\nNovanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as, the Company\u201d, Novanta\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d, our\u201d) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs\u201d) a competitive advantage. We combine deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables us to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to our customers' demanding applications.\nEnd Markets\nWe primarily operate in two end markets: the advanced industrial market and the medical market.\nAdvanced Industrial Market\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 50% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, the financial condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market.\nMedical Market\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the medical market accounted for approximately 50% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, trends in surgical procedures, changes in technology requirements, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends.\nStrategy\nOur strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including:\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> disciplined focus on our diversified business model of providing functionality to long life-cycle OEM customer platforms in attractive medical and advanced industrial niche markets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> improving our business mix to increase medical sales as a percentage of total revenue by:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> introducing new products aimed at attractive medical applications, such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, ophthalmology, patient monitoring, drug delivery, clinical laboratory testing and life science equipment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> deepening our key account management relationships with and driving cross selling of our product offerings to leading medical equipment manufacturers; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> pursuing complementary medical technology acquisitions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> increasing our penetration of high growth advanced industrial applications, such as laser materials processing, robotics, automation and metrology, by working closely with OEM customers to launch application specific products that closely match the requirements of each application;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> broadening our portfolio of enabling proprietary technologies and capabilities through increased investment in new product development, expanded sales and marketing channels to reach target customers, and investments in application development to further penetrate existing customers, while expanding the applicability of our solutions to new markets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions in medical and advanced industrial technology applications, including increasing our recurring revenue streams such as services, spare parts and consumables;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> improving our existing operations to expand profit margins and improve customer satisfaction by implementing lean manufacturing principles and strategic sourcing across our major production sites; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> attracting, retaining, and developing world-class talented and motivated employees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSignificant Events and Updates\nAcquisition of Zettlex Holdings Limited\nOn May 1, 2018, we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Zettlex Holdings Limited ( Zettlex\u201d), a Cambridge, United Kingdom-based provider of inductive encoder products that provide absolute and accurate positioning, even in extreme operating environments, to OEMs in the medical and advanced industrial markets. The purchase price of \u00a323.3 million ($32.0 million), net of working capital adjustments, was financed with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We expect that the addition of Zettlex will broaden the range of components and solutions that we can provide our customers by combining our commercial resources and application-specific competencies with Zettlex's technologies and strong team. Zettlex is included in our Precision Motion reportable segment.\nAcquisition of Remaining Equity Ownership in Laser Quantum\nOn September 27, 2018, we acquired the remaining approximately 24% of the outstanding shares of Laser Quantum for an aggregate consideration of $45.1 million in cash and restricted stock. The acquisition of these noncontrolling interests was accounted for as a transaction among shareholders. No gain or loss was recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. The total purchase price was financed with cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facility, and the issuance of 213,219 shares of restricted stock with a fair market value of $14.4 million. The restricted stock will become fully vested upon achievement of certain milestones as specified in the restricted stock agreement. Restricted stock not otherwise vested as of December 31, 2025 will be subject to forfeiture.\nOverview of Financial Results\nTotal revenue for 2018 was $614.3 million, an increase of $93.0 million, or 17.8%, versus 2017. The effect of our acquisitions in 2017 and 2018 resulted in an increase in revenue of $52.9 million, or 10.2%. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted our revenue by $3.7 million, or 0.6%, in 2018.\nOperating income increased $13.4 million from $57.6 million in 2017 to $71.0 million in 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $41.0 million as a result of higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $27.5 million, primarily due to acquisitions in 2017 and 2018.\nDiluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) of $1.43 in 2018 increased $0.30 from an EPS of $1.13 in 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to higher operating income and a $22.0 million decrease in the Laser Quantum nontaxable redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment from 2017, partially offset by the $26.4 million nontaxable gain recognized from the acquisition of the additional approximately 35% of Laser Quantum equity interest in 2017. Diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2018 was positively impacted by a $1.8 million redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment, while Diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by a $20.2 million redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment. (See Note 10 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nSpecific components of our operating results for 2018, 2017 and 2016 are further discussed below.\nResults of Operations\nThe

The increase in gross profit margin was primarily related to changes in product mix.\nPrecision Motion segment gross profit for 2017 increased $6.5 million, or 16.3%, versus 2016, primarily due to an increase in revenue. Precision Motion segment gross profit margin was 44.0% for 2017, compared with a gross profit margin of 45.3% for 2016. The decrease in gross profit margin was attributable to temporary supply chain transition challenges in our Celera Motion business, which led to production inefficiencies and quality impacts.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table sets forth operating expenses for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development and engineering\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 115,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 101,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of purchased intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 190,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 162,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 129,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development and Engineering Expenses\nResearch and development and engineering ( R&D\u201d) expenses are primarily comprised of employee compensation and related expenses and cost of materials for R&D projects.\nR&D expenses were $51.0 million, or 8.3% of revenue, in 2018, versus $41.7 million, or 8.0% of revenue, in 2017. R&D expenses increased in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue primarily due to higher investments across the majority of our product lines and acquisitions in 2017 and 2018.\nR&D expenses were $41.7 million, or 8.0% of revenue, in 2017, versus $32.0 million, or 8.3% of revenue, in 2016. R&D expenses increased in terms of total dollars primarily due to R&D expenses from acquisitions in 2016 and 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses include costs for sales and marketing, sales administration, finance, human resources, legal, information systems and executive management.\nSG&A expenses were $115.9 million, or 18.9% of revenue, in 2018, versus $101.7 million, or 19.5% of revenue, in 2017. SG&A expenses increased in terms of total dollars primarily due to acquisitions in 2017 and 2018, and an increase in compensation as a result of higher headcount and stock-based compensation expense.\nSG&A expenses were $101.7 million, or 19.5% of revenue, in 2017, versus $81.3 million, or 21.1% of revenue, in 2016. SG&A expenses increased in terms of total dollars primarily due to acquisitions in 2016 and 2017, investments in sales and marketing resources and higher variable compensation associated with the Company's financial performance.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets is charged to our Photonics, Vision and Precision Motion segments. Amortization of core technologies is included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. Amortization of customer relationships, trademarks, backlog and other intangibles are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets, excluding the amortization of developed technologies that is included in cost of revenue, was $15.6 million, or 2.5% of revenue, in 2018, versus $12.1 million, or 2.3% of revenue, in 2017. The increase, in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue, was the result of acquired intangible assets from acquisitions in 2017 and 2018.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets, excluding the amortization of developed technologies that is included in cost of revenue, was $12.1 million, or 2.3% of revenue, in 2017, versus $8.3 million, or 2.1% of revenue, in 2016. The increase, in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue, was the result of acquired intangible assets from acquisitions in 2016 and 2017.\nRestructuring, Acquisition and Divestiture Related Costs\nRestructuring, acquisition and divestiture related charges primarily relate to our restructuring programs, acquisition related costs incurred for completed acquisitions, acquisition costs related to future potential acquisitions and failed acquisitions, and changes in fair value of contingent considerations.\nWe recorded restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs of $8.0 million in 2018, versus $7.5 million in 2017. The increase in restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs versus 2017 was primarily due to a $1.7 million increase in restructuring related charges as a result of the 2018 and 2019 restructuring programs, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related charges of $1.2 million mostly attributable to an investment banking success fee related to the acquisition of WOM in 2017.\nWe recorded restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs of $7.5 million in 2017, versus $7.9 million in 2016. The decrease in restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs versus 2016 was primarily due to a $2.6 million decrease in restructuring related charges as a result of the 2016 restructuring program which was substantially completed in 2016, partially offset by an increase in acquisition related charges of $2.2 million mostly attributable to an investment banking success fee related to the WOM acquisition.\nOperating Income (Loss) by Segment\nThe following table sets forth operating income (loss) by segment for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Photonics\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vision\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,277\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Precision Motion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (28,937\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29,123\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,086\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 71,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPhotonics\nPhotonics segment operating income was $59.3 million, or 23.8% of revenue, in 2018, versus $51.7 million, or 22.2% of revenue, in 2017. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $11.0 million, partially offset by an increase in R&D expenses and SG&A expenses of $3.7 million. Photonics segment operating income was favorably affected by a $2.3 million decrease in amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of intangible assets.\nPhotonics segment operating income was $51.7 million, or 22.2% of revenue, in 2017, versus $35.2 million, or 20.2% of revenue, in 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $29.4 million, partially offset by increases in operating expenses, primarily related to the Laser Quantum acquisition and increased volumes in our legacy product lines. Photonics segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was negatively affected by a $7.1 million increase in amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of intangible assets.\nVision\nVision segment operating income was $9.0 million, or 3.9% of revenue, in 2018, versus $7.9 million, or 4.3% of revenue, in 2017. The increase in operating income in terms of total dollars was primarily due to an increase in gross profit, partially offset by the inclusion of full-year operating expenses from WOM in 2018. Vision segment operating income was negatively affected by a $1.1 million net increase in amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of intangible assets.\nVision segment operating income was $7.9 million, or 4.3% of revenue, in 2017, versus an operating loss of $1.3 million, or (1.0%) of revenue, in 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $22.1 million and a decrease in spending primarily related to our 2016 restructuring program, which was substantially completed in 2016, partially offset by an increase in R&D and SG&A expenses related to acquisitions in 2017. Vision segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was negatively affected by a $6.0 million increase in amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of intangible assets.\nPrecision Motion\nPrecision Motion segment operating income was $31.7 million, or 24.0% of revenue, in 2018, versus $27.1 million, or 25.6% of revenue, in 2017. The increase in operating income in terms of total dollars was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $12.9 million, partially offset by an increase in R&D and SG&A expenses of $3.5 million and an increase in acquisition earn-out costs of $4.0 million associated with the Zettlex acquisition.\nPrecision Motion segment operating income was $27.1 million, or 25.6% of revenue, in 2017, versus $21.1 million, or 23.9% of revenue, in 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $6.5 million.\nUnallocated Corporate and Shared Services\nUnallocated corporate and shared services costs primarily represent costs of corporate and shared service functions and other public company costs that are not allocated to the operating segments, including certain restructuring and most acquisition related costs.\nUnallocated corporate and shared services costs for 2018 decreased by $0.2 million, or 0.6%, from 2017.\nUnallocated corporate and shared services costs for 2017 increased by $7.0 million, or 31.9%, from 2016 primarily due to an increase in acquisition related costs of $2.3 million mostly attributable to an investment banking success fee related to the WOM acquisition, and an increase in SG&A expenses of $5.4 million as a result of higher headcount and higher variable compensation associated with the Company's financial performance.\nInterest Income (Expense), Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), and Other Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table sets forth interest income (expense), foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), and other income (expense) for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income (expense), net\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9,814\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,165\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,559\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (447\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (44\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (229\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on acquisition of business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nNet interest expense was $9.8 million in 2018 versus $7.2 million in 2017. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in average debt levels as a result of acquisitions in 2017 and 2018 and an increase in the weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on our Senior Credit Facilities was 3.53% and 3.32% during 2018 and 2017, respectively. Included in net interest expense was non-cash interest expense of approximately $1.0 million and $0.8 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to the amortization of deferred financing costs on our debt.\nNet interest expense was $7.2 million in 2017 versus $4.6 million in 2016. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in average debt levels as a result of acquisitions in 2017, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on our Senior Credit Facilities was 3.32% and 3.52% during 2017 and 2016, respectively. Included in net interest expense was non-cash interest expense of approximately $0.8 million and $0.9 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to the amortization of deferred financing costs on our debt.\nForeign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), Net\nForeign exchange transaction gains (losses), net, were $0.1 million net gains in 2018 versus $0.4 million net losses in 2017 primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound, Euro and Japanese Yen, and net realized gains from foreign currency contracts.\nForeign exchange transaction gains (losses), net, were $0.4 million net losses in 2017 versus $2.3 million net gains in 2016 primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound, Euro and Japanese Yen.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nNet other expense was nominal in 2018 versus $0.2 million in 2017. The decrease in net other expense was primarily due to a decrease in net periodic pension costs of our frozen U.K. defined benefit pension plan covering employees of a divested business.\nOther income (expense) was $0.2 million net other expense in 2017 versus $1.8 million net other income in 2016 primarily due to earnings from our equity-method investment in Laser Quantum reported in other income (expense) prior to 2017. In January 2017, we acquired an additional approximately 35% of the outstanding shares of Laser Quantum. As a result of this acquisition, earnings from Laser Quantum have been consolidated in the Company's consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date.\nGain on Acquisition of Business\nThe gain on acquisition of business in 2017 was related to a nontaxable gain of $26.4 million recognized upon gaining control of Laser Quantum in January 2017 as a result of acquiring an additional approximately 35% of its outstanding shares.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded a tax provision of $10.2 million in 2018, as compared to a tax provision of $13.8 million in 2017. The effective tax rate for 2018 was 16.7% of income before taxes, compared to an effective tax rate of 18.2% of income before taxes for 2017. Our effective tax rate in 2018 differs from the Canadian statutory rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, including the benefit of the new 21% U.S. corporate income tax rate and $1.6 million of estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Reform Act\u201d), a $0.9 million benefit from share-based compensation, a $1.9 million U.K. patent box deduction and $1.3 million of other tax credits; offset by $0.8 million of non-deductible expenses recognized under an earn-out agreement in connection with the Zettlex acquisition.\nWe recorded a tax provision of $13.8 million in 2017, as compared to a tax provision of $10.5 million in 2016. The effective tax rate for 2017 was 18.2% of income before taxes, compared to an effective tax rate of 32.3% of income before taxes for 2016. Our effective tax rate in 2017 differs from the Canadian statutory rate of 29.0% primarily due to a $1.2 million tax effect of non-deductible acquisition related expenses and a $2.8 million provision for the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 as a result of the Tax Reform Act, which reduced the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. These increases were offset by a $2.0 million benefit from international tax rate differences, a $1.1 million benefit due to the Section 199 Domestic Production Activity deduction in the U.S., a $1.0 million benefit associated with R&D and foreign tax credits generated in 2017, recognition of $1.6 million net tax benefits from uncertain tax positions upon expiration of statute of limitations and conclusion of income tax audits, and a $1.6 million benefit from the patent box deduction in the U.K. In addition, in 2017, we reported a nontaxable gain of $26.4 million on our previously-held Laser Quantum equity interest and wrote off $1.5 million of Laser Quantum related deferred tax liability, which had a combined 8.7% favorable impact on our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of our debt and related interest expense. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provides another potential source of liquidity for acquisitions. We may seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nSignificant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and market changes in general. See Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure\u201d included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us. We cannot assure you that applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary.\nAs of December 31, 2018, $49.2 million of our $82.0 million cash and cash equivalents was held by our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Approximately 64.4% of our outstanding borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities (defined below) were held in our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries. In certain instances, we have identified excess cash for which we may repatriate and have established liabilities for the expected tax cost. Because of the ownership structure of the Company, our foreign entities outside the U.S. are not considered controlled foreign corporations of the U.S. company, as defined under U.S. tax principles, and accordingly, the accumulated earnings of these foreign subsidiaries are not subject to the one-time tax on the repatriation of foreign earnings (the Toll Charge\u201d) under the Tax Reform Act.\nShare Repurchase Plans\nIn October 2013, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan (the 2013 Repurchase Plan\u201d) under which we could repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock up to an aggregate amount of $10.0 million. During 2018, we repurchased 89 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $5.9 million at an average price of $65.43 per share under the 2013 Repurchase Plan. As of December 31, 2018, we had repurchased a cumulative total of 385 thousand shares under the 2013 Repurchase Plan for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million at an average price of $25.97 per share. As of December 31, 2018, we had completed the 2013 Repurchase Plan.\nIn October 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the 2018 Repurchase Plan\u201d) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $25.0 million worth of common shares. We expect that share repurchases will be made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We had $25.0 million available for share repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Plan as of December 31, 2018.\nUnder the 2018 Repurchase Plan, shares may be repurchased from time to time, at our discretion, based on its ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common stock, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated stock purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common stock to be purchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. The 2018 Repurchase Plan does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock. No time limit was set for the completion of the 2018 Repurchase Plan, and the plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund the share repurchases through cash on hand and future cash generated from operations.\nSecond Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\nIn May 2016, we entered into the second amended and restated senior secured credit agreement (the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\u201d), consisting of a $75.0 million, 5-year term loan facility and a $225.0 million, 5-year revolving credit\nfacility (collectively, the Senior Credit Facilities\u201d). The Senior Credit Facilities mature in May 2021. In August 2017, we entered into a third amendment (the Third Amendment\u201d) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment increased the borrowing limit under the revolving credit facility commitment from $225 million to $325 million and reset the accordion feature to $125 million for future expansion. Additionally, the Third Amendment increased the term loan balance from $65.6 million to $90.6 million. The term loan is payable in quarterly installments of $2.3 million beginning in October 2017, with the remaining amount due upon maturity. We may make payments to pay down our revolving credit facility with cash on hand and cash generated from future operations.\nOn February 26, 2018, we entered into a fourth amendment (the Fourth Amendment\u201d) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment increased the maximum permitted consolidated leverage ratio from 3.00 to 3.50, increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for permitted acquisitions and stock repurchases from 2.50 to 3.00, increased the maximum permitted consolidated leverage ratio for a designated acquisition from 3.00 to 3.50, and increased the maximum leverage ratio for four consecutive quarters following a designated acquisition from 3.50 to 4.00. Certain other technical changes were made to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as a result of the Fourth Amendment and are not considered material.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had a term loan of $74.5 million and revolving loans of $135.1 million outstanding under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nThe Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum allowed leverage ratio and a minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement).

The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to debt repayments of $74.6 million, acquisition of the remaining equity interest in Laser Quantum of $30.8 million, current year business acquisitions of $29.6 million, and capital expenditures of $14.7 million. These cash outflows were offset by cash provided by operating activities of $89.6 million and borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $55.3 million.\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows and unused borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility for the years indicated (in thousands):\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents, end of year\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 82,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 100,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 89,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (45,590\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (177,380\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (12,865\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (60,164\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (23,189\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unused borrowing capacity available under revolving credit facility, end of year\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 189,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 175,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 215,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Cash Flows\nCash provided by operating activities was $89.6 million in 2018, versus $63.4 million in 2017. Cash provided by operating activities in 2018 increased from 2017 primarily due to the increase in operating income.\nCash provided by operating activities for 2018 was positively impacted by an increase in our days payables outstanding and an increase in accrued expenses. The Company's growth in revenue of $93.0 million and gross profit of $41.0 million increased our outstanding trade receivables and inventories, which negatively impacted our cash provided by operating activities.\nCash provided by operating activities for 2017 was positively impacted by an increase in our outstanding payables and accrued expenses. Cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by an increase in outstanding trade receivables and an increase in inventories, excluding trade receivables and inventories acquired from acquisitions in 2017, and an increase in income tax payments.\nCash provided by operating activities for 2016 was positively impacted by an increase in our days payables outstanding from 41 days at December 31, 2015 to 53 days at December 31, 2016 and improvement in our inventory turnover ratio from 3.6 at December 31, 2015 to 3.7 at December 31, 2016. Cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by an increase in our days sales outstanding from 57 days at December 31, 2015 to 59 days at December 31, 2016.\nIn January 2019, we paid \u00a33.0 million ($3.9 million) as the first installment under our earn-out obligations in connection with the Zettlex acquisition, which will be reported as cash used in operating activities in the first quarter of 2019.\nInvesting Cash Flows\nCash used in investing activities was $45.6 million during 2018, primarily related to $29.6 million in cash outflows (net of cash acquired of $3.8 million) related to acquisitions in 2018 and $14.7 million in capital expenditures.\nCash used in investing activities was $177.4 million during 2017, primarily driven by our acquisitions of WOM, ThingMagic and Laser Quantum. In connection with these acquisitions, we paid $185.0 million in cash considerations, which is reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows as $168.3 million cash outflows from investing activities (net of cash acquired of $16.7 million and working capital adjustments). We also paid $9.1 million for capital expenditures during 2017.\nCash used in investing activities was $12.9 million during 2016, primarily due to $13.4 million in cash consideration paid for the Reach acquisition and the acquisition of certain developed technology assets, and $8.5 million in cash paid for capital expenditures, partially offset by $3.6 million in net cash consideration received from the sale of our Orlando, Florida facility in March 2016, $3.4 million in net cash consideration received from the sale of our Chatsworth, California facility in August 2016, $0.4 million received from the finalization of the Lincoln Laser acquisition working capital adjustments, and $1.5 million received from the release of escrow funds from our 2014 Scientific Lasers divestiture.\nWe have no material commitments to purchase property, plant and equipment. We expect to use approximately $14 million to $16 million in 2019 for capital expenditures related to investments in new property, plant and equipment for our existing businesses.\nFinancing Cash Flows\nCash used in financing activities was $60.2 million during 2018, primarily due to $30.8 million of cash consideration paid for the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in Laser Quantum, $9.2 million of contractual term loan payments, $65.4 million of optional repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $3.6 million of payroll tax payments on stock-based compensation awards, and $5.9 million of repurchases of common stock, partially offset by $55.3 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid for the acquisition of Zettlex and the remaining equity interest in Laser Quantum.\nCash provided by financing activities was $143.3 million during 2017, primarily due to $176.8 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund a portion of the cash considerations paid for the WOM, ThingMagic and Laser Quantum acquisitions, partially offset by $7.9 million of contractual term loan payments, $19.0 million of optional repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $2.5 million of contingent consideration payments, $2.1 million of payroll withholding tax payments on stock-based compensation awards, $0.4 million of repurchases of our common shares and $0.9 million of principal payments under our capital lease obligations. We also paid $0.7 million for debt issuance costs as a result of the Third Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement entered into in August 2017.\nCash used in financing activities was $23.2 million during 2016, primarily due to $7.5 million of contractual term loan payments, $8.8 million of optional repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $1.8 million of payroll withholding tax payments on stock-based compensation awards, $1.6 million of repurchases of our common shares, and $1.2 million of principal payments under our capital lease obligations. We also paid $2.5 million for debt issuance costs as a result of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement signed in May 2016.\nIn 2019, we are contractually required to pay $4.6 million (comprised of two quarterly payments of $2.3 million) on our term loan facility and $0.6 million in principal payments under our capital lease obligations. In addition, we may pay down our term loan and revolving credit facility from time to time with available cash generated from future operating activities.\nOther Liquidity Matters\nPension Plans\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan in the U.K. (the U.K. Plan\u201d). Our U.K. Plan was closed to new members in 1997 and stopped accruing additional pension benefits for existing members in 2003, thereby limiting our obligation to benefits earned through that date. Benefits under this plan were based on the employees' years of service and compensation as of the date the plan was frozen, adjusted for inflation. On July 1, 2013, the Company provided a Guarantee (the Guarantee\u201d) in favor of the trustees of the U.K. Plan with respect to all present and future obligations and liabilities (whether actual or contingent and whether owed jointly or severally and in any capacity whatsoever) under the U.K. Plan of Novanta Technologies UK Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Novanta Inc.\nOur funding policy is to fund pensions based on actuarial methods as permitted by regulatory authorities. The results of funding valuations depend on both the funding deficit and the assumptions used (such as asset returns, discount rates, mortality, retail price inflation and other market driven changes). The assumptions used represent one estimate of many possible future outcomes. The final cost to us will be determined by events as they actually become known. Due to the underfunded position that our U.K. Plan currently has and potential changes in the actual outcomes relative to the assumptions used in funding valuations, we may have to increase payments to fund this plan in the future. As of December 31, 2018, the projected benefit obligation under the U.K. Plan exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $3.8 million.\nBased on the results of the most recent funding valuation, the Company's annual contributions are expected to be approximately $0.9 million in 2019 and will increase by 2.9% per year thereafter.\nAs a result of the covenant that exists between our U.K. subsidiary and the Plan Trustees regarding the funding of the U.K. Plan, our ability to transfer assets outside our U.K. subsidiary, and its wholly owned subsidiary in China, may be limited.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future years. We have excluded the future cash payments for unrecognized tax benefits of $4.5 million, including interest and penalties, because we are uncertain if and when such amounts may be settled. These unrecognized tax benefits are further explained in Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 - 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2022 - 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior Credit Facilities (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 209,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 204,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on Senior Credit Facilities (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 93,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.K. pension plan (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contingent consideration and earn-outs (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 401,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 118,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 237,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2018, a total of $74.5 million of borrowings under our term loan and $135.1 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility were outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities.

On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, assessment of the valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and tangible long-lived assets, contingent consideration obligations, employee benefit plans, restructuring charges, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for loss contingencies. Actual results in the future could differ significantly from our estimates.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult and subjective judgments.\nRevenue Recognition. Beginning January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( ASU 2014-09\u201d or Topic 606\u201d) using the modified retrospective method. Under Topic 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identifying the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determining the transaction price; (iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognizing revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nWe recognize revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. This generally occurs upon shipment when the title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of our revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of our customers, we may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month, and total less than 3% of our consolidated revenue. Revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. These services generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is normally the contractually stated amount.\nWe occasionally sell separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. We recognize the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin.\nWe account for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. The shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control.\nWe generally provide warranties for our products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 24 months for our Photonics and Precision Motion segments and 12 months to 36 months for the Vision segment. The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450, Contingencies,\u201d as we have the ability to ascertain the likelihood of\nthe liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated cost related to warranty is recorded to cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. Our estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent our experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting entry recorded to cost of revenue.\nWe expense incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. We do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer's payment for that good are typically one year or less.\nInventories. Inventories, which include materials and conversion costs, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first-in, first-out method. Cost includes the cost of purchased materials, inbound freight charges, external and internal processing and applicable labor and overhead costs. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.\nWe regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our forecasted product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historical levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, which would reduce our earnings. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower cost of revenue and higher income from operations than expected in that period.\nShare-Based Compensation. We record expenses associated with share-based compensation awards to employees and directors based on the fair value of awards as of the grant date. For share-based compensation awards that vest over time based on employment, the associated expenses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations ratably over the vesting period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures.\nWe grant two types of performance-based awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units ( EPS-PSUs\u201d) and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units ( TSR-PSUs\u201d). For EPS-PSUs, share-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period when it is probable that specified performance targets are expected to be achieved based on management's projections. Management's projections are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods when underlying factors change the evaluation of the probability of achieving the performance targets. Accordingly, share-based compensation expense associated with EPS-PSUs may differ significantly from period to period based on changes to the probability of achieving performance targets. For TSR-PSUs, we recognize the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, which is determined using the Monte-Carlo simulation valuation model as of the date of grant. The expense related to TSR-PSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the performance period, which is generally three years.\nThe Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the grant agreement and calculates the fair market value for the market-based restricted stock units granted. The Monte Carlo simulation model also uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance conditions, including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied, and the resulting fair value of the award.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets. The purchase price we pay for acquired companies is allocated first to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value. Any excess purchase price is then allocated to goodwill. We make various assumptions and estimates in order to assign fair value to acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. These assumptions typically include cash flow forecasts, discount rates, technology royalty rates, and customer attrition rates, among others. Actual cash flows may vary from forecasts used to value these assets at the time of the business combination.\nOur most significant identifiable intangible assets are customer relationships, acquired technologies, trademarks and trade names. In addition to our review of the carrying value of each asset, the useful life assumption for each asset, including the classification of certain intangible assets as indefinite-lived,\u201d are reviewed on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them. All definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the periods in which their economic benefits are expected to be realized.\nImpairment analyses of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are conducted in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other.\u201d During the second quarter of 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-14, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\u201d ( ASU 2017-04\u201d or Topic 350\u201d), which eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. We test our goodwill balances annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an\nimpairment may exist. Should the fair value of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment loss may be necessary.\nWe evaluate our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment at the reporting unit level which is generally at least one level below our reportable segments. We have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. In performing the qualitative assessment, we review factors both specific to the reporting unit and to the Company as a whole, such as financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and the fair value of each reporting unit at the last valuation date. If we elect this option and believe, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable, the quantitative impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required.\nAlternatively, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative impairment test. This approach requires a comparison of the carrying value of each of our reporting units to the fair value of these reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated primarily using a discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) method. The DCF approach requires that we forecast future cash flows for each of the reporting units and discount the cash flow streams based on a weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) that is derived, in part, from comparable companies within similar industries. The DCF calculations also include a terminal value calculation that is based upon an expected long-term growth rate for the applicable reporting unit. The carrying values of each reporting unit include assets and liabilities which relate to the reporting unit's operations. Additionally, reporting units that benefit from corporate assets or liabilities are allocated a portion of those corporate assets and liabilities on a proportional basis.\nWe assess indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently if impairment indicators are identified. We also periodically reassess their continuing classification as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment exists if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value. An impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded to reduce the carrying value to its fair value.\nWe evaluate amortizable intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with ASC 360-10-35-15, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,\u201d whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the reporting units may exceed the undiscounted cash flow forecasts attributable to the reporting units. If undiscounted cash flow forecasts indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets may not be recoverable, a fair value assessment is performed. For intangible assets, fair value estimates are derived from discounted cash flow forecasts. For other long-lived assets (primarily property, plant and equipment), fair value estimates are derived from the sources most appropriate for the particular asset and have historically included such approaches as sales comparison approach and replacement cost approach. If fair value is less than carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded. We also review the useful life and residual value assumptions for definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them.\nFactors which may trigger an impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets include the following:\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> long-term negative industry or economic trends;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> technological changes or developments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> changes in competition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> loss of key customers or personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> adverse judicial or legislative outcomes or political developments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period of time; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the decline of our market capitalization below net book value as of the end of any reporting period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe occurrence of any of these events or any other unforeseeable events or circumstances that materially affect future operating results or cash flows may cause an impairment that is material to our results of operations or financial position in the reporting period in which it occurs or is identified.\nThe most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test was performed as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2018, using a qualitative assessment, noting no impairment. As of December 31, 2018, there were no indicators of impairment of our long-lived assets.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The following table shows the breakdown of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment by reportable segment as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Intangible Assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Property, Plant & Equipment, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Photonics\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vision\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 123,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Precision Motion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 217,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 142,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPension Plans. Our subsidiary located in the U.K. maintains a defined benefit pension plan (the U.K. Plan\u201d). The U.K. Plan was closed to new membership in 1997 and stopped accruing for additional pension benefits for existing members in 2003, limiting our obligation to benefits earned through that date. Benefits under this plan were based on the employees' years of service and compensation as of the date the plan was frozen, adjusted for inflation. At December 31, 2018, the fair market value of the plan assets was $33.1 million, which was $3.8 million, or 10.2%, less than the projected benefit obligation of $36.9 million.\nThe cost and obligations of our U.K. Plan are calculated using many assumptions. Major assumptions used in the accounting for this pension plan include the discount rate, rate of inflation, mortality rate and expected return on plan assets. Assumptions are determined each year based on data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with a third-party actuary. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension cost and the unfunded benefit obligation as of the end of the year. The most sensitive assumption affecting the determination of our U.K. Plan pension obligation is the discount rate. A 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate as of December 31, 2018 would change the pension obligation by $3.2 million.\nAccounting for Income Taxes. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to calculate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are reported on our consolidated balance sheet.\nJudgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate outcome is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made.\nWe record a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets would be recorded and would increase our net income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets will be recorded and will reduce our net income in the period such determination is made.\nIn conjunction with our ongoing review of our actual results and anticipated future earnings, we continuously reassess the adequacy of the valuation allowance currently in place on our deferred tax assets. In 2018, we released valuation allowance of $0.3 million recorded on net operating losses and other timing items in certain tax jurisdictions. The decrease of our valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes,\u201d which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.\nThe amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities in the period that the assessments are made or\nresolved, or when the statute of limitations for certain periods expires. As of December 31, 2018, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $4.7 million, of which $3.6 million would favorably affect our effective tax rate, if recognized. Over the next twelve months, we may need to record up to $0.5 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits in the event of statute of limitations closures.\nIncome and foreign withholding taxes have not been recognized on the excess of the amount for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature. This amount becomes taxable upon a repatriation of assets from a subsidiary or a sale or liquidation of a subsidiary. The amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries totaled $135.6 million as of December 31, 2018. The estimated unrecognized income and foreign withholding tax liability on this temporary difference is approximately $0.3 million.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Reform Act. The Tax Reform Act significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system, providing a one-time transition Toll Charge on foreign earnings, creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense and modifying the officer's compensation limitation. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018.\nAs a result of the Tax Reform Act, we revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the newly enacted 21% U.S. corporate income tax rate. Because of the ownership structure of the Company, our foreign entities outside the U.S. are not considered controlled foreign corporations of the U.S. company, as defined under U.S. tax principles, and accordingly, the accumulated earnings of these foreign subsidiaries are not subject to the one-time transition Toll Charge under the Tax Reform Act.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no changes made to the provisional amounts recognized in 2017 in connection with the enactment of the Tax Reform Act. The accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act is complete as of December 31, 2018.\nLoss Contingencies. We are subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims relating to labor, service and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. We review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the financial statement. As additional information becomes available, we will reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. We expense legal fees as incurred.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements for recent accounting pronouncements that could have an effect on us.", "summary": "The report is about Novanta Inc., a leading global supplier of technology solutions to medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, the financial condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market.\nMedical Market\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the medical market accounted for approximately 50% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, trends in surgical procedures, changes in technology requirements, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends.\nStrategy\nOur strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including:\n \u2022 disciplined focus on our diversified business model of providing functionality to long life-cycle OEM customer platforms in attractive medical and advanced industrial niche markets; \n \u2022 improving our business mix to increase medical sales as a percentage of total revenue by: \n - introducing new products aimed at attractive medical applications, such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, ophthalmology, patient monitoring, drug delivery, clinical laboratory testing and life science equipment; \n - deepening our key account management relationships with and driving cross selling of our product offerings to leading medical equipment manufacturers; and \n - pursuing complementary medical technology acquisitions; \n \u2022 increasing our penetration of high growth advanced industrial applications, such as laser materials processing, robotics, automation and metrology, by working closely with OEM customers to launch application specific products that closely match the requirements of each application; \n \u2022 broadening our portfolio of enabling proprietary technologies and capabilities through increased investment in new product development, expanded sales and marketing channels to reach target customers, and investments in application development to further penetrate existing customers, while expanding the applicability of our solutions to new markets; \n \u2022 broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions in medical and advanced industrial technology applications, including increasing our recurring revenue streams such as services, spare parts and consumables; \n \u2022 improving our existing operations to expand profit margins and improve customer satisfaction by implementing lean manufacturing principles and strategic sourcing across our major production sites; and \n \u2022 attracting, retaining, and developing world-class talented and motivated employees. \nSignificant Events and Updates\nAcquisition of Zettlex Holdings Limited\nOn May 1, 2018, we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Zettlex Holdings Limited ( Zettlex\u201d), a Cambridge, United Kingdom-based provider of inductive encoder products that provide absolute and accurate positioning, even in extreme operating environments, to OEMs in the medical and advanced industrial markets. The purchase price of \u00a323.3 million ($32.0 million), net of working capital adjustments, was financed with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We expect that the addition of Zettlex will broaden the range of components and solutions that we can provide our customers by combining our commercial resources and application-specific competencies with Zettlex's technologies and strong team. Zettlex is included in our Precision Motion reportable segment.\nAcquisition of Remaining Equity Ownership in Laser Quantum\nOn September 27, 2018, we acquired the remaining approximately 24% of the outstanding shares of Laser Quantum for an aggregate consideration of $45.1 million in cash and restricted stock. The acquisition of these noncontrolling interests was accounted for as a transaction among shareholders. No gain or loss was recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. The total purchase price was financed with cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facility, and the issuance of 213,219 shares of restricted stock with a fair market value of $14.4 million. The restricted stock will become fully vested upon achievement of certain milestones as specified in the restricted stock agreement. Restricted stock not otherwise vested as of December 31, 2025 will be subject to forfeiture.\nOverview of Financial Results\nTotal revenue for 2018 was $614.3 million, an increase of $93.0 million, or 17.8%, versus 2017. The effect of our acquisitions in 2017 and 2018 resulted in an increase in revenue of $52.9 million, or 10.2%. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted our revenue by $3.7 million, or 0.6%, in 2018.\nOperating income increased $13.4 million from $57.6 million in 2017 to $71.0 million in 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $41.0 million as a result of higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $27.5 million, primarily due to acquisitions in 2017 and 2018.\nDiluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) of $1.43 in 2018 increased $0.30 from an EPS of $1.13 in 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to higher operating income and a $22.0 million decrease in the Laser Quantum nontaxable redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment from 2017, partially offset by the $26.4 million nontaxable gain recognized from the acquisition of the additional approximately 35% of Laser Quantum equity interest in 2017. Diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2018 was positively impacted by a $1.8 million redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment, while Diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by a $20.2 million redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment. (See Note 10 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nSpecific components of our operating results for 2018, 2017 and 2016 are further discussed below.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of revenue for the years indicated:\n\nRevenue\nThe following table sets forth external revenue by reportable segment for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):\n\nPhotonics\nPhotonics segment revenue in 2018 increased by $17.0 million, or 7.3%, versus 2017, due to an increase in revenue across all of our product lines.

The purchase price of \u00a323.3 million ($32.0 million), net of working capital adjustments, was financed with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We expect that the addition of Zettlex will broaden the range of components and solutions that we can provide our customers by combining our commercial resources and application-specific competencies with Zettlex's technologies and strong team. Zettlex is included in our Precision Motion reportable segment.\nAcquisition of Remaining Equity Ownership in Laser Quantum\nOn September 27, 2018, we acquired the remaining approximately 24% of the outstanding shares of Laser Quantum for an aggregate consideration of $45.1 million in cash and restricted stock. The acquisition of these noncontrolling interests was accounted for as a transaction among shareholders. No gain or loss was recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. The total purchase price was financed with cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facility, and the issuance of 213,219 shares of restricted stock with a fair market value of $14.4 million. The restricted stock will become fully vested upon achievement of certain milestones as specified in the restricted stock agreement. Restricted stock not otherwise vested as of December 31, 2025 will be subject to forfeiture.\nOverview of Financial Results\nTotal revenue for 2018 was $614.3 million, an increase of $93.0 million, or 17.8%, versus 2017. The effect of our acquisitions in 2017 and 2018 resulted in an increase in revenue of $52.9 million, or 10.2%. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted our revenue by $3.7 million, or 0.6%, in 2018.\nOperating income increased $13.4 million from $57.6 million in 2017 to $71.0 million in 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $41.0 million as a result of higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $27.5 million, primarily due to acquisitions in 2017 and 2018.\nDiluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) of $1.43 in 2018 increased $0.30 from an EPS of $1.13 in 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to higher operating income and a $22.0 million decrease in the Laser Quantum nontaxable redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment from 2017, partially offset by the $26.4 million nontaxable gain recognized from the acquisition of the additional approximately 35% of Laser Quantum equity interest in 2017. Diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2018 was positively impacted by a $1.8 million redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment, while Diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by a $20.2 million redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment. (See Note 10 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nSpecific components of our operating results for 2018, 2017 and 2016 are further discussed below.\nResults of Operations\nThe

The increase, in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue, was the result of acquired intangible assets from acquisitions in 2016 and 2017.\nRestructuring, Acquisition and Divestiture Related Costs\nRestructuring, acquisition and divestiture related charges primarily relate to our restructuring programs, acquisition related costs incurred for completed acquisitions, acquisition costs related to future potential acquisitions and failed acquisitions, and changes in fair value of contingent considerations.\nWe recorded restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs of $8.0 million in 2018, versus $7.5 million in 2017. The increase in restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs versus 2017 was primarily due to a $1.7 million increase in restructuring related charges as a result of the 2018 and 2019 restructuring programs, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related charges of $1.2 million mostly attributable to an investment banking success fee related to the acquisition of WOM in 2017.\nWe recorded restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs of $7.5 million in 2017, versus $7.9 million in 2016. The decrease in restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs versus 2016 was primarily due to a $2.6 million decrease in restructuring related charges as a result of the 2016 restructuring program which was substantially completed in 2016, partially offset by an increase in acquisition related charges of $2.2 million mostly attributable to an investment banking success fee related to the WOM acquisition.\nOperating Income (Loss) by Segment\nThe following table sets forth operating income (loss) by segment for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Photonics\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vision\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,277\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Precision Motion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (28,937\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29,123\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,086\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 71,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPhotonics\nPhotonics segment operating income was $59.3 million, or 23.8% of revenue, in 2018, versus $51.7 million, or 22.2% of revenue, in 2017.
