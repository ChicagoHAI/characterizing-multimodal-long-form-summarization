Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. This section provides additional information regarding our businesses, current developments, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, contractual commitments and critical accounting policies.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nWe are a global media company that provides content across multiple distribution platforms, including pay-TV, free to air (\"FTA\") and broadcast television, authenticated applications, digital distribution arrangements and content licensing agreements. Our portfolio of networks includes prominent television brands such as Discovery Channel, our most widely distributed global brand, TLC, Animal Planet, Food Network, HGTV, ID, MotorTrend (previously known as Velocity and known as Turbo outside of the U.S.) and Eurosport, a leading sports entertainment pay-TV programmer across Europe and Asia. We operate production studios, and prior to the sale of our Education Business on April 30, 2018, we sold curriculum-based education products and services (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nOur objectives are to invest in content for our networks to build viewership, optimize distribution revenue, capture advertising sales and create or reposition branded channels and businesses that can sustain long-term growth and occupy a desired content niche with strong consumer appeal. Our strategy is to maximize the distribution, ratings and profit potential of each of our branded networks. In addition to growing distribution and advertising revenues for our branded networks, we are extending content distribution across new platforms, including brand-aligned websites, on-line streaming, mobile devices, VOD and broadband channels, which provide promotional platforms for our television content and serve as additional outlets for advertising and distribution revenue. Audience ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenue and creating demand on the part of cable television operators, DTH satellite operators, telecommunication service providers, and other content distributors, that deliver our content to their customers.\nOur content spans genres including survival, exploration, sports, general entertainment, home, food and travel, heroes, adventure, crime and investigation, health and kids. We have an extensive library of high-definition content and own rights to much of our content and footage, which enables us to exploit our library to launch brands and services into new markets quickly. Our content can be re-edited and updated in a cost-effective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world on a variety of platforms.\nAlthough the Company utilizes certain brands and content globally, we classify our operations in two reportable segments: U.S. Networks, consisting principally of domestic television networks and digital distribution arrangements, and International Networks, consisting primarily of international television networks and digital distribution arrangements. In addition, Education and Other consists principally of a production studio, and prior to the sale of the Education Business on April 30, 2018, curriculum-based education products and services (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) Our segment presentation aligns with our management structure and the financial information management uses to make strategic and operating decisions, such as the allocation of resources and business performance assessments. For further discussion of our Company, segments in which we do business, and our content development activities and revenues, see our business overview set forth in Item 1, \"Business\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2018 vs. 2017\nThe discussion below compares our actual and pro forma combined results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, as if the OWN and MTG transactions and the acquisition of Scripps Networks (collectively, \"the Transactions\") occurred on January 1, 2017. Management believes reviewing our actual operating results in addition to combined pro forma results is useful in identifying trends in, or reaching conclusions regarding, the overall operating performance of our businesses. This information has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, is not intended to be a substitute for or superior to GAAP. Please see our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Our combined U.S. Networks, International Networks and Corporate and Inter-Segment Eliminations pro forma information is based on the historical operating results of the respective businesses as applicable to each segment and includes adjustments directly attributable to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2017, such as:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.\n</td> <td>The impact of the purchase price allocation to the fair value of assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests, such as intangible amortization;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.\n</td> <td>Adjustments to remove items associated with the Transactions that will not have a continuing impact on the combined entity, such as transaction costs and the impact of employee retention agreements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.\n</td> <td>Changes to align accounting policies\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjustments do not include costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. Pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of what our results would have been had we operated the acquired businesses since January 1, 2017 and should not be taken as indicative of the Company's future consolidated results of operations.\nActual amounts for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 include the results of operations for the Discovery and Scripps Networks, OWN and MTG businesses for the period since each respective transaction. Scripps Networks was acquired on March 6, 2018, OWN was consolidated on November 30, 2017 and MTG was consolidated on September 25, 2017.\nConsolidated Results of Operations - 2018 vs. 2017\nOur

earned from SVOD content licensing and other emerging forms of digital distribution. Distribution revenue increased 31%, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. Excluding the impact of the Transactions and on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, distribution revenue increased 3%. Increases at International Networks were primarily driven by increases in subscribers to our linear networks and higher digital subscription revenues and increases in pricing in Europe and Latin America. Increases at U.S. Networks were principally attributable to an increase in contractual affiliate rates, which was partially offset by a decline in subscribers and, to a lesser extent, the timing of content deliveries under SVOD arrangements.\nAdvertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the stage of development of television markets, the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content, our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels, market demand, the mix in sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets and economic conditions. These factors impact the pricing and volume of our advertising inventory. Advertising revenue increased 79%, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. Excluding the impact of the Transactions and on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, advertising revenue increased 3%. The increases were due to continued monetization of our digital content offerings, an increase in pricing at U.S. Networks, and the Olympics.\nOther revenue increased 54%, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. Excluding the impact of the Transactions and on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, other revenue increased 8%. The increases were primarily due to sublicensing of Olympics sports rights to broadcast networks throughout Europe, partially offset by the Education and Other revenue that decreased 66% following the disposition of the Education Business on April 30, 2018. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nRevenue for our segments is discussed separately below under the heading Segment Results of Operations.\u201d\nCosts of Revenues\nCosts of revenues increased 48%, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. The Company's principal component of costs of revenues is content expense. Content expense includes television series, television specials, films, sporting events and digital products. The costs of producing a content asset and bringing that asset to market consist of film costs, participation costs, exploitation costs and manufacturing costs. Content rights expense excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations was $2.9 billion and $1.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding the impact of the Transactions and foreign currency fluctuations, costs of revenue increased 5%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and on a pro forma combined basis, costs of revenues increased 2%. The increases were primarily due to spending on the Olympics at International Networks, partially offset by the impact of higher content impairment expenses recorded in the prior year at U.S. Networks and the impact of the disposition of the Education Business. On a pro forma combined basis and excluding the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations, content expense was $3.0 billion for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Content impairment is generally a component of costs of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. However, during the year ended December 31, 2018, content impairments of $405 million were reflected as a component of restructuring and other charges as a result of the strategic programming changes following the acquisition of Scripps Networks. No content impairments were recorded as a component of restructuring and other charges during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs, marketing costs, research costs, occupancy and back office support fees. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 48%, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. Excluding the impact of the Transactions, directly related third-party transaction and planned integration costs and foreign currency fluctuations, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6%, primarily due to increased marketing spend at International Networks, increased share-based compensation expense, charge-backs to an equity method investee in the prior year that is now consolidated, and increases in technology costs and tax advisory fees, partially offset by decreases at Education and Other following the disposition of the Education Business on April 30, 2018. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and on a pro forma combined basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were largely consistent with the prior year.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nNo goodwill impairment expense was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018. Goodwill impairment expense of $1.3 billion was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017. (See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization increased $1.1 billion, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. On a pro forma combined basis, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $249 million, primarily due to pro forma amortization in 2017 related to the ad revenue backlog intangible, which had a one-year useful life and was fully amortized on a pro forma basis in 2017.\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nRestructuring and other charges increased $675 million, primarily as a result of content impairments associated with changes in programming strategies, involuntary severance actions associated with the integration of Scripps Networks, costs associated with the termination of long-term programming arrangements, and lease exit costs. (See Note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) On a pro forma combined basis, restructuring and other charges increased $685 million. We expect to incur additional restructuring and integration expenses related to employee and contract terminations, relocation from the Company's Silver Spring headquarters to New York City, and content costs.\n(Gain) Loss on Disposition\nWe recorded an $84 million gain during the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the sale of a controlling stake in the Education Business on April 30, 2018, compared with a loss of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the disposition of the Raw and Betty production studios. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $254 million, primarily due to interest accrued on higher debt balances, including the senior notes issued on September 21, 2017 and term loans outstanding from March 6, 2018 through September 30, 2018. The senior notes and term loans were used to effect the acquisition of Scripps Networks. (See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nOn March 13, 2017, we issued new senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $650 million and used the proceeds to fund the repurchase of $600 million of combined aggregate principal amount of our then-outstanding senior notes through a cash tender offer that closed on March 13, 2017. As a result, we recognized a $54 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which included $50 million for premiums to par value, $2 million of non-cash write-offs of unamortized deferred financing costs, $1 million for the write-off of the original issue discount of these senior notes and $1 million accrued for other third-party fees. (See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nLoss from equity investees, net\nThe loss from our equity method investees decreased $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a reduction in losses from investments in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy, and to a lesser extent, inclusion of equity earnings as a result of the acquisition of Scripps Networks, partially offset by the absence of earnings from the Company's equity method investment in OWN and impairments of $29 million. (See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nOther Expense, Net\nThe table below presents the details of other income (expense), net (in millions).\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency losses, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(93\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(83\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains (losses) on derivative instruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(82\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in the value of common stock investments with readily determinable fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(88\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remeasurement gain on previously held equity interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (expense) income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(120\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(110\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal other expense, net increased $10 million in 2018 compared to 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018 we recorded losses on common stock investments with readily determinable fair value due to the adoption of the recognition and measurement of financial instruments guidance on January 1, 2018, which requires us to record gains and losses on equity investments with readily determinable fair values in other expense, net. Previously, unrealized gains and losses were recorded in other comprehensive income. The increase in foreign currency losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 was mostly related to remeasurement of net monetary assets and transactions associated with the Polish Zloty, the Euro and other European currencies, partially offset by a reduction in losses associated with the British Pound. We recorded gains on derivative instruments for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to losses for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to losses of $98 million recorded during the prior year on interest rate contracts used to economically hedge the pricing for the issuance of a portion of the dollar-denominated senior notes on September 21, 2017 and, to a lesser extent, gains recorded in the current year on the equity collar used to mitigate the risk of market fluctuations with respect to 50% of the Lionsgate shares held by the Company and foreign currency swaps. (See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) On November 30, 2017, the Company acquired from Harpo a controlling interest in OWN. We recognized a remeasurement gain of $33 million to account for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of previously held 49.50% equity interest.

During 2018, the increase in the income tax expense was primarily attributable to an increase in income, a reduction in benefits from investment tax credits from our renewable energy investments, the effect of foreign operations, which included the establishment of valuation allowances and write-offs of deferred tax assets, and elimination of the domestic production activity deduction, partially offset by the lower U.S. Federal statutory income tax rate, a decrease in expense for uncertain tax positions, and a tax benefit from TCJA rate change on the deferred tax liability recomputation as a result of U.S. legislative changes that extended the accelerated deduction of qualified film productions.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Scripps Networks, we recorded reserves in purchase accounting totaling $110 million for foreign tax matters claimed by tax authorities that are currently pending resolution. After the purchase accounting measurement period closes on March 5, 2019, any adjustment to these estimated amounts resulting from their resolution will affect net income in the period resolved.\nSegment Results of Operations - 2018 vs. 2017\nWe evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and Adjusted OIBDA. Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income excluding: (i) mark-to-market share-based compensation, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) restructuring and other charges, (iv) certain impairment charges, (v) gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, (vi) certain inter-segment eliminations related to production studios, and (vii) third-party transaction costs directly related to the acquisition and integration of Scripps Networks. We use this measure to assess the operating results and performance of our segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance, and allocate resources to each segment. We believe Adjusted OIBDA is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. We exclude mark-to-market share-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, certain impairment charges, gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and Scripps Networks acquisition and integration costs from the calculation of Adjusted OIBDA due to their impact on comparability between periods. We also exclude the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets and deferred launch incentives as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. Certain corporate expenses and inter-segment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives.\nAdjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, operating income, net income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d).\nAdditional financial information for our segments and geographical areas in which we do business is discussed in Note 23 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe table below presents our Adjusted

is excluded for each of the periods presented herein. During 2018, the Company began granting a higher percentage of equity classified awards (in lieu of liability classified awards, which require mark-to-market accounting) under its stock incentive plans, and expects to continue this action in future periods. Since most equity classified awards are non-cash expenses not entirely under management control, the Company has elected to exclude all share-based compensation from Adjusted OIBDA beginning in 2019. The revised definition of Adjusted OIBDA will be used by our chief operating decision maker in evaluating segment performance in 2019.\nThe following table presents Adjusted OIBDA as historically

</tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nDistribution revenue increased 52%, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. Excluding the impact of the Transactions and on a pro forma combined basis, distribution revenue increased 1% reflecting the impact of an increase in contractual affiliate rates, partially offset by a decline in subscribers and to a lesser extent, the timing of content deliveries under SVOD arrangements. On a pro forma combined basis, total portfolio subscribers for December 2018 were 4% lower than December 2017 and subscribers to our fully distributed networks were consistent with the prior year, due to additional carriage toward the end of the year, which offset the general trend of subscriber declines.\nAdvertising revenue increased $2.0 billion, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. Excluding the impact of the Transactions and on a pro forma combined basis, advertising revenue increased 3%. The increases were due to the continued monetization of our digital content offerings and an increase in pricing, partially offset by the impact of audience declines on our linear networks.\nOther revenue increased 77%, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. Excluding the impact of the Transactions, other revenue decreased 27% due to lower program and merchandising sales. On a pro forma combined basis, other revenue in 2018 was largely consistent with 2017.\nCosts of Revenues\nCosts of revenues increased 91%, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. Excluding the impact of the Transactions, costs of revenues decreased 4% and on a pro forma combined basis, costs of revenues decreased 5%. The decreases were primarily due to higher content impairment expenses recorded in costs of revenues in 2017. Content expense was $1.5 billion and $776 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Pro forma combined content expense was $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Content impairment is generally a component of costs of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. However, during the year ended December 31, 2018, content impairments of $221 million were reflected as a component of restructuring and other charges as a result of the strategic programming changes following the acquisition of Scripps Networks. No content impairments were recorded as a component of restructuring and other charges during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $611 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. Excluding the impact of the Transactions, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4% as expenses in the prior year were reduced by charge-backs to an equity method investee that is now consolidated. On a pro forma combined basis, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3%, primarily as a result of reductions in personnel costs due to restructuring.\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA increased 73%, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. Excluding the impact of the Transactions, Adjusted OIBDA increased 3% driven by an increase in revenues and decrease in costs of revenues, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. On a pro forma combined basis, Adjusted OIBDA increased 8%, driven by an increase in revenues combined with decreases in costs of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses.\nInternational Networks\nThe following table presents, for our International Networks segment, revenues by type, certain operating expenses, Adjusted OIBDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted

Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Scripps Networks and on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, distribution revenue increased 5%. The increases were primarily driven by increases in subscribers to our linear networks, higher digital subscription revenues in Europe and increases in pricing in Europe and Latin America.\nAdvertising revenue increased 33%, primarily due to the impact of the acquisition of Scripps Networks. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Scripps Networks and foreign currency fluctuations, advertising revenue increased 2%. The increase was primarily attributable to the Olympics. On a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, advertising revenue increased 3%. The increase was primarily attributable to the Olympics and strength in certain European markets, and to a lesser extent continued monetization of our digital distribution offerings, partially offset by linear viewership declines in Europe and Latin America.\nOther revenue increased $215 million. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Scripps Networks and foreign currency fluctuations, other revenue increased $153 million. On a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, other revenue increased $147 million. The increases were primarily due to sublicensing of Olympics sports rights to broadcast networks throughout Europe during 2018.\nCosts of Revenues\nCosts of revenues increased 29%, mostly due to the impact of the acquisition of Scripps Networks. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Scripps Networks and foreign currency fluctuations, costs of revenues increased 12%. On a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, costs of revenues increased 11%. The increases were primarily attributable to spending on the Olympics, partially offset by content synergies from the integration of Scripps Networks. Content rights expenses, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, was $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. On a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, content rights expense was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Content impairment is generally a component of costs of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. However, during the year ended December 31, 2018, content impairments of $184 million were reflected as a component of restructuring and other charges as a result of the strategic programming changes following the acquisition of Scripps Networks. No content impairments were recorded as a component of restructuring and other charges during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 21%, mostly due to the impact of the acquisition of Scripps Networks. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Scripps Networks and foreign currency fluctuations, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7%. On a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2%. The increases were due to increased marketing spend, particularly related to our digital distribution offerings. On a pro forma combined basis, the increase in costs was partially offset by cost savings from the integration of Scripps Networks.\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA increased 25%, primarily due to the acquisition of Scripps Networks. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Scripps Networks and foreign currency fluctuations, Adjusted OIBDA increased 2%. On a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, Adjusted OIBDA increased 7%. The increases reflect the growth in revenues, which outpaced the increases in costs of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe impairment of goodwill reflected above for International Networks is a portion of the total goodwill impairment recorded for the European reporting unit during 2017. The remaining portion of the impairment of $838 million is a component of corporate and inter-segment eliminations. The presentation of goodwill impairment is consistent with the financial reports that are reviewed by the Company's CEO. Goodwill has been allocated from corporate assets to reporting units within the International Networks segment.\nEducation and Other\nThe following table presents revenues, certain operating expenses, Adjusted OIBDA, and a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to operating income (in millions) for Education and Other.\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(60\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on disposition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inter-segment eliminations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubsequent to the sale of an 88% stake in the Education Business resulting in deconsolidation on April 30, 2018, Education and Other only includes activities associated with inter-company sales of productions for our U.S. Networks segment.

services, substantially all of our share-based compensation and transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of Scripps Networks.\nThe Adjusted OIBDA loss increased 23% in 2018 as compared to 2017. Excluding the impact of the Transactions and foreign currency fluctuations, the Adjusted OIBDA loss increased 16%, due to an increase in selling, general and administrative costs driven by increases in technology costs, tax advisory fees, and share-based compensation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and on a pro forma combined basis, the Adjusted OIBDA loss was largely consistent with the prior year as the aforementioned increases were offset by a reduction in personnel costs as a result of restructuring and the integration of Scripps Networks.\nThe impairment of goodwill presented above for corporate and inter-segment eliminations is a portion of the total goodwill impairment recorded for the European reporting unit during 2017. The remaining portion of the impairment of $489 million is a component of our International Networks segment. The presentation of goodwill impairment is consistent with the financial reports that are reviewed by the Company's CEO. Goodwill has been allocated from corporate assets to reporting units within corporate and inter-segment eliminations.\nItems Impacting Comparability\nFrom time to time certain items may impact the comparability of our consolidated results of operations between two periods. In comparing the financial results for the years 2018 and 2017, in addition to the Transactions, the Company has identified foreign currency as one such item, as noted below.\nForeign Currency\nThe impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons of our results. For example, our international revenues are favorably impacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the U.S dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis (ex-FX), in addition to results reported in accordance with GAAP provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation ex-FX excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results. The presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.\nThe ex-FX change represents the percentage change on a period-over-period basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts. The ex-FX change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate, which is a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process (the 2018 Baseline Rate\u201d), and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2018 Baseline Rate. In addition, consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment, our ex-FX results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities, as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Selling, general and administrative expense, as presented below, excludes mark-to-market share-based compensation and Scripps Networks transaction and integration costs due to their impact on comparability between periods.\nThe impact of foreign currency on the comparability of our consolidated results is as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n(Reported)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n(ex-FX)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe impact of foreign currency on the comparability of our financial results for International Networks is as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International Networks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n(Reported)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n(ex-FX)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS -

Not meaningful\nRevenues\nDistribution revenue increased 8% in 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, distribution revenue increased 7%. U.S. Networks distribution revenue increases were driven by increases in affiliate fee rates and increases in SVOD revenue partially offset by a decline in affiliate subscribers. Total U.S. Networks portfolio subscribers declined 5% for the year ended December 31, 2017, while subscribers to our fully distributed networks declined 3% for the same period. International Networks' distribution revenue increase was mostly due to increases in contractual rates in Europe following further investment in sports content, and to a lesser extent increases in Latin America due to increases in rates offset by decreases in subscribers. Contributions from other distribution revenues also contributed slightly to growth. Other distribution revenues were comprised of content deliveries under licensing agreements. These increases were partially offset by decreases in contractual rates in Asia.\nAdvertising revenue increased 3% in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase for our U.S. Networks was primarily due to pricing increases and continued monetization of our GO platform, partially offset by lower audience delivery due to continued linear distribution audience universe declines. International Networks' increases were primarily due to increased volume across key markets in Europe, particularly Southern Europe and Germany, and Latin America. The increase was partially offset by declines in ad sales due to lower pricing and volume in Asia.\nOther revenue increased 4% compared with the prior year, primarily due to the formation and consolidation of the MTG joint venture (then known as VTEN) during the third quarter of the current year. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nCosts of Revenues\nCosts of revenues increased 9%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, OWN and MTG transactions and the Group Nine Transaction, costs of revenues increased 7% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to increased spending on content at our International Networks segment, particularly sports rights and associated production costs. Content amortization was $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 5%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, OWN and MTG transactions, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to transaction costs for the Scripps Networks acquisition and integration costs of $79 million, including the $35 million charge associated with the modification of Advance/Newhouse's preferred stock. (See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nImpairment of Goodwill\nGoodwill impairment expense of $1.3 billion was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017. (See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was consistent for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with the prior period as capital spending has remained consistent over the periods.\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nRestructuring and other charges increased $17 million. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel-related termination costs for voluntary and involuntary severance actions. (See Note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nLoss (Gain) on Disposition\nThe change in loss (gain) on disposition was $67 million. We recorded a $4 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the sale of the Raw and Betty production studios on April 28, 2017, compared with a gain of $63 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The gain on disposition recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 is comprised of the $50 million gain for the deconsolidation of our digital networks business Seeker and SourceFed Studios in connection with the Group Nine Transaction and the $13 million gain due to the disposition of our radio businesses in the Nordics. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $122 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to costs incurred for the unsecured bridge loan commitment as well as interest accrued on the senior notes issued on September 21, 2017 for the financing of the Scripps Networks acquisition. (See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nOn March 13, 2017, we issued new senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $650 million and used the proceeds to fund the repurchase of $600 million of combined aggregate principal amount of our then-outstanding senior notes through a cash tender offer that closed on March 13, 2017. As a result, we recognized a $54 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which included $50 million for premiums to par value, $2 million of non-cash write-offs of unamortized deferred financing costs, $1 million for the write-off of the original issue discount of the existing senior notes and $1 million accrued for other third-party fees. (See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nLoss from Equity Investees, net\nLosses from our equity method investees increased $173 million primarily due to losses from investments in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy, partially offset by increases in earnings at OWN and decreases in losses at All3Media. (See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\nThe table below presents the details of other expense, net (in millions).\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency (losses) gains, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(83\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Losses on derivative instruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(82\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remeasurement gain on previously held equity interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other-than-temporary impairment of AFS investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other (expense) income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(110\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther expense increased $114 million in 2017. We recorded foreign currency losses during 2017 compared to foreign currency gains during 2016, mostly due to exchange rate changes on the U.S. dollar compared with the British pound that impacted foreign currency monetary assets. Increases in losses from derivative instruments primarily resulted from losses of $98 million on interest rate contracts used to economically hedge the pricing for the issuance of a portion of the dollar-denominated senior notes, which were settled on September 21, 2017. The interest rate contracts did not receive hedging designation. The losses were partially offset by various other items, including a gain of $17 million on previously settled interest rate contracts for which the hedged issuance of debt is considered remote following the issuance of the senior notes on September 21, 2017. (See Note 9 and Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) On November 30, 2017, the Company acquired from Harpo a controlling interest in OWN. We recognized a remeasurement gain to account for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of our previously held 49.50% equity interest.

During 2017, the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the impact of non-cash goodwill impairment charges that are non-deductible for tax purposes. Thereafter, the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to investment tax credits that we receive related to our renewable energy investments, and to a lesser extent, the domestic production activity deduction benefit, the allocation and taxation of income among multiple foreign and domestic jurisdictions, and the impact of the TCJA (see Note 18 to the accompanying consolidating financial statements). The benefits were partially offset by an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2017. In 2016, we favorably resolved multi-year state tax positions that resulted in a reduction of reserves related to uncertain tax positions that did not recur in 2017.\nSegment Results of Operations -

Excluding the impact of the OWN transaction, distribution revenues increased 4%, primarily driven by increases in affiliate fee rates and increases in SVOD revenue due to the timing of content deliveries. These increases were partially offset by a decline in affiliate subscribers. Total portfolio subscribers declined 5% for the year ended December 31, 2017, while subscribers to our fully distributed networks declined 3% for the same period.\nAdvertising revenue increased 3%. Excluding the impact of the OWN and MTG transactions and the Group Nine Transaction, advertising revenue increased 2% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to pricing increases and continued monetization of our GO platform, partially offset by lower audience delivery due to continued linear distribution audience universe declines.\nOther revenue increased 30% primarily due to the formation and consolidation of the MTG joint venture (then known as VTEN) during the third quarter of the current year. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nCosts of Revenues\nCosts of revenues increased 3% for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Excluding the impact of OWN and MTG transactions and the Group Nine Transaction, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1% for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, distribution revenue increased 9%. The increase was mostly due to increases in contractual rates in Europe following further investment in sports content, and to a lesser extent increases in Latin America due to increases in rates offset by decreases in subscribers. Contributions from other distribution revenues also contributed slightly to growth. Other distribution revenues were comprised of content deliveries under licensing agreements. These increases were partially offset by decreases in contractual rates in Asia.\nAdvertising revenue increased 4%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, advertising revenue increased 3%. The increase was primarily driven by increases in volume across key markets in Europe, particularly Southern Europe and Germany, and Latin America. The increase was partially offset by declines in ad sales due to lower pricing and volume in Asia.\nOther revenue remained consistent with the prior year.\nCosts of Revenues\nCosts of revenues increased 15%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, costs of revenues increased 12%. The increase was mostly attributable to increased spending on content, particularly sports rights and associated production costs. Content amortization was $1.1 billion and $976 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses remained consistent with the prior year.\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA increased 3% as increases in distribution and advertising revenues were offset by increases in costs of revenues, related to content expense.\nThe impairment of goodwill presented above for International Networks is a portion of the total goodwill impairment recorded for the European reporting unit during 2017. The remaining portion of the impairment of $838 million is a component of corporate and inter-segment eliminations. The presentation of goodwill impairment is consistent with the financial reports that are reviewed by the Company's CEO.

The remaining portion of the impairment of $489 million is a component of our International Networks segment. The presentation of goodwill impairment is consistent with the financial reports that are reviewed by the Company's CEO. Goodwill has been allocated from corporate assets to reporting units within corporate and inter-segment eliminations.\nThe decrease in mark-to-market share-based compensation expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in Discovery's stock price in 2017 compared to 2016. Changes in stock price are a key driver of fair value estimates used in the attribution of expense for stock appreciation rights (\"SARs\") and performance-based restricted stock units (\"PRSUs\"). By contrast, stock options and service-based restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") are fair valued at grant date and amortized over their vesting period without mark-to-market adjustments. The expense associated with stock options and RSUs is included in Adjusted OIBDA as a component of selling, general and administrative expense.\nItems Impacting Comparability\nFrom time to time certain items may impact the comparability of our consolidated results of operations between two periods. In comparing the financial results for the years 2017 and 2016, the Company has identified foreign currency as one such item, as noted below. The Company also has various acquisitions and dispositions that impact the comparability of our results. To the extent that the transaction materially impacts a particular item or segment, it may be discussed in the relevant section above (see Note 3 to the accompanying consolidating financial statements).\nForeign Currency\nThe impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons of our results. For example, our international revenues are favorably impacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the U.S dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis (\"ex-FX\"), in addition to results reported in accordance with GAAP, provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation ex-FX excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results. The presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.\nThe ex-FX change represents the percentage change on a period-over-period basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts. The ex-FX change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate, a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process, (the 2016 Baseline Rate\u201d) and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2016 Baseline Rate. In addition, consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment, our ex-FX results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. The impact of foreign currency on the comparability of our results is reflected in the tables below (in millions). Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n(Reported)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n(ex-FX)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,656\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,432\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,686\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,652\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International Networks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n(Reported)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n(ex-FX)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,677\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,462\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(745\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(743\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity\nSources of Cash\nHistorically, we have generated a significant amount of cash from operations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we funded our working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2018, we had $986 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. We are a well-known seasoned issuer and have demonstrated the ability to conduct registered offerings of securities, including debt securities, common stock and preferred stock, on short notice. Access to sufficient capital from the public market is not assured.\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Debt\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Senior Notes\nIn connection with the acquisition of Scripps Networks on March 6, 2018, the Company assumed $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of Scripps Networks 2.750% senior notes due 2019, 2.800% senior notes due 2020, 3.500% senior notes due 2022, 3.900% senior notes due 2024 and 3.950% senior notes due 2025 (the \"Scripps Networks Senior Notes\").\nOn April 3, 2018, pursuant to the Offering Memorandum and Consent Solicitation Statement to Exchange dated March 5, 2018, Discovery Communications, LLC (\"DCL\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the exchange of $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount of Scripps Networks Senior Notes, for $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount of DCL's 2.750% senior notes due 2019 (the \"2019 Notes\"), 2.800% senior notes due 2020 (the \"2020 Notes\"), 3.500% senior notes due 2022 (the \"2022 Notes\"), 3.900% senior notes due 2024 (the \"2024 Notes\") and 3.950% senior notes due 2025 (the \"2025 Notes\"). Interest on the 2019 Notes and the 2024 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. Interest on the 2020 Notes, the 2022 Notes and the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year commencing in 2018. The exchange was accounted for as a debt modification and, as a result, third-party issuance costs were expensed as incurred.\nOn September 21, 2017, DCL issued $500 million principal amount of 2.200% senior notes due 2019, $1.20 billion principal amount of 2.950% senior notes due 2023, $1.70 billion principal amount of 3.950% senior notes due 2028, $1.25 billion principal amount of 5.000% senior notes due 2037, $1.25 billion principal amount of 5.200% senior notes due 2047 (collectively, the Senior Fixed Rate Notes\u201d) and $400 million principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2019 (the Senior Floating Rate Notes\u201d and, together with the Senior Fixed Rate Notes, the USD Notes\u201d). Interest on the Senior Fixed Rate Notes is payable on March 20 and September 20 of each year. Interest on the Senior Floating Rate Notes is payable on March 20, June 20, September 20 and December 20 of each year. The USD Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. On September 21, 2017, DCL also issued \u00a3400 million principal amount ($540 million at issuance based on the exchange rate of $1.35 per pound at September 21, 2017) of 2.500% senior notes due 2024 (the Sterling Notes\u201d). Interest on the Sterling Notes is payable on September 20 of each year. The proceeds received by DCL from the USD Notes and the Sterling Notes were net of a $11 million issuance discount and $57 million of debt issuance costs.\nOn March 13, 2017, DCL issued $450 million principal amount of 3.800% senior notes due March 13, 2024 (the \"2017 USD Notes\") and an additional $200 million principal amount of its existing 4.900% senior notes due March 11, 2026 (the \"2016 USD Notes\"). Interest on the 2017 USD Notes is payable semi-annually on March 13 and September 13 of each year. Interest on the 2016 USD Notes is payable semi-annually on March 11 and September 11 of each year. The proceeds received by DCL from the 2017 USD Notes were net of a $1 million issuance discount and $4 million of debt issuance costs. The proceeds received by DCL from the 2016 USD Notes included a $10 million issuance premium and were net of $2 million of debt issuance costs.\nDCL used the proceeds from the offerings of the 2017 USD Notes and the 2016 USD Notes to repurchase $600 million aggregate principal amount of DCL's 5.050% senior notes due 2020 and 5.625% senior notes due 2019 in a cash tender offer. The repurchase resulted in a pretax loss on extinguishment of debt of $54 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, which is presented as a separate line item on the Company's consolidated statements of operations and recognized as a component of financing cash outflows on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The loss included $50 million for premiums to par value, $2 million of non-cash write-offs of unamortized deferred financing costs, $1 million for the write-off of the original issue discount of these senior notes and $1 million accrued for other third-party fees.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe have access to a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, as amended on August 11, 2017. (See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) Borrowing capacity under this agreement is reduced by the outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility of $225 million at a weighted average interest rate of 3.82%. The revolving credit facility agreement provides for a maturity date of August 11, 2022 and the option for up to two additional 364-day renewal periods. All obligations of DCL and the other borrowers under the revolving credit facility are unsecured and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Discovery.\nThe credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility (the Credit Agreement\u201d) contains customary representations, warranties and events of default, as well as affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on liens, investments, indebtedness, dispositions, affiliate transactions, dividends and restricted payments. DCL, its subsidiaries and Discovery are also subject to a limitation on mergers, liquidation and disposals of all or substantially all of their assets. The Credit Agreement, as amended on August 11, 2017, continues to require DCL to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of no less than 3:00 to 1:00 and now requires a consolidated leverage ratio of financial covenant of 5.50 to 1.00, with step-downs to 5.00 to 1.00 in the first year after the closing of the acquisition of Scripps Networks and 4.50 to 1.00 in the second year after the closing. As of December 31, 2018, Discovery, DCL and the other borrowers were in compliance with all covenants and there were no events of default under the Credit Agreement.\nTerm Loans\nOn August 11, 2017, DCL entered into a delayed draw and unsecured term loan credit facility (the \"Term Loans\"), with a three-year tranche and a five-year tranche, each with a principal amount of up to $1 billion. The term of each delayed draw loan commenced on March 6, 2018 when Discovery borrowed the full amount of both tranches to finance a portion of the acquisition of Scripps Networks. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had used cash from operations and borrowings under the commercial paper program to repay in full the Term Loan borrowings.\nCommercial Paper\nUnder our commercial paper program and subject to market conditions, DCL may issue unsecured commercial paper notes guaranteed by the Company from time to time up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any given time of $1 billion. The maturities of these notes vary but may not exceed 397 days. The notes may be issued at a discount or at par, and interest rates vary based on market conditions and the credit rating assigned to the notes at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2018, we did not have outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper program would reduce the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility arrangement referenced above.\nWe repay our senior notes, revolving credit facility, Term Loans, and commercial paper as required, and accordingly these sources of cash also require use of our cash.\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Dispositions\n</td> </tr>\n</table> On April 30, 2018, the Company sold an 88% controlling equity stake in its Education Business to Francisco Partners for cash of $113 million and recorded a gain of $84 million upon disposition. Discovery retained a 12% ownership interest in the Education Business, which is accounted for as an equity method investment. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Real Estate Strategy and Relocation of Global Headquarters\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The Company enters into multi-year lease arrangements for transponders, office space, studio facilities and other equipment. Most leases are not cancelable prior to their expiration. On January 9, 2018, the Company announced plans to relocate its global headquarters from Silver Spring, Maryland (\"the Silver Spring property\") to New York City in 2019. During the third quarter, the Company entered into a sale-lease back transaction for the Silver Spring property. The lease is classified as an operating lease. As a result of the sale, the Company received net proceeds of $68 million and recognized an impairment loss of $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 which is reflected in depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statements of operations.\nUses of Cash\nOur primary uses of cash include the creation and acquisition of new content, business acquisitions, repurchases of our capital stock, income taxes, personnel costs, principal and interest on our outstanding senior notes, and funding for various equity method and other investments.\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Investments and Business Combinations\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Scripps Networks Acquisition\nOn March 6, 2018, Discovery completed the acquisition of Scripps Networks (the \"acquisition of Scripps Networks\"). The Company elected to exercise in full the cash top-up option. The acquisition of Scripps Networks consideration consisted of (i) for Scripps Networks shareholders who did not make an election or elected the mixed consideration, $65.82 in cash and 1.0584 shares of Discovery Series C common stock for each Scripps Networks share, (ii) for Scripps Networks shareholders that elected the cash consideration, $90.00 in cash for each Scripps Networks share and (iii) for Scripps Networks shareholders that elected the stock consideration, 3.9392 shares of Discovery Series C common stock for each Scripps Networks share, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Discovery, Scripps Networks and Skylight Merger Sub, Inc., dated July 30, 2017 (the \"Merger Agreement\").\nThe consideration for the acquisition of Scripps Networks totaled $12 billion, including cash of $8.8 billion and stock of $3.2 billion based on share prices as of March 6, 2018.\nIn addition, we assumed $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of Scripps Networks 2.75% senior notes due 2019, 2.8% senior notes due 2020, 3.5% senior notes due 2022, 3.9% senior notes due 2024 and 3.95% senior notes due 2025. On April 3, 2018, we completed a transaction in which most of Scripps Network outstanding debt was exchanged for DCL senior notes. In connection with that transaction, Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, fully and unconditionally guaranteed the DCL senior notes.\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Other Investments\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our uses of cash have included investment in equity method investments and equity investments without readily determinable fair value. (See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) We provide funding to our investees from time to time. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we contributed $17 million in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy.\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Due to business combinations, we also have redeemable equity balances of $415 million, which may require the use of cash in the event holders of noncontrolling interests put their interests to us. (See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Content Acquisition\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We plan to continue to invest significantly in the creation and acquisition of new content.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company had repurchased 3 million and 164 million shares of our Series A and Series C common stock over the life of the program for the aggregate purchase price of $171 million and $6.6 billion, respectively. We have funded our stock repurchases through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and the issuance of debt. In the future, should our board of directors authorize a new stock repurchase program, we may also choose to fund stock repurchases through borrowings under our revolving credit facility and future financing transactions. (See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Income Taxes and Interest\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We expect to continue to make payments for income taxes and interest on our outstanding senior notes. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we made cash payments of $389 million and $740 million for income taxes and interest on our outstanding debt, respectively.\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Debt\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We have $1.8 billion of outstanding senior notes due in 2019, of which $411 million of our 5.625% senior notes due in August 2019 will be redeemed on March 21, 2019. (See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) As of December 31, 2018, the Company had repaid in full $2 billion in Term Loans using cash from operations and borrowings under the Company's commercial paper program.\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Restructuring and Other\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our uses of cash include restructuring and other charges related to contract terminations and employee terminations. These charges result from activities to integrate Scripps Networks and establish an efficient cost structure. As of December 31, 2018, we had restructuring liabilities of $108 million related to employee and contract terminations. (See Note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) We expect to incur additional restructuring and integration expenses related to employee and contract terminations, relocation from the Silver Spring property to New York City, and costs related to content.\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Share-Based Compensation\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We expect to continue to make payments for vested cash-settled share-based awards. Actual amounts expensed and payable for cash-settled awards are dependent on future fair value calculations, which are primarily affected by changes in our stock price or changes in the number of awards outstanding. During 2018, no payments were made for cash-settled share-based awards. As of December 31, 2018, liabilities totaled $54 million for outstanding liability-classified share-based compensation awards, of which $23 million was classified as current. (See Note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nCash Flows\nChanges in cash and cash equivalents were as follows (in millions).\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>390\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,593\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(633\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(256\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(283\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,184\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,323\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(90\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities increased $947 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in income following the acquisition of Scripps Networks, partially offset by cash paid for interest and spending on content, including sports rights.\nCash provided by operating activities increased $249 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to a $253 million decrease in cash paid for taxes. The decrease in cash paid for taxes, net, for the year ended December 31, 2017 is mostly due to the tax impact from our investments in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy. (See Note 5 and Note 22 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) Declines in working capital, primarily due to changes in accounts receivable, were offset by a decrease in the net negative effect of foreign currency and increases in payables.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities increased $8.0 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Scripps Networks, partially offset by a reduction in payments for investments. See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nCash flows used in investing activities increased $377 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was mostly attributable to an increase in payments for investments of $172 million, including renewable energy projects and payments for derivative instruments of $98 million that did not receive hedge accounting, but economically hedged pricing risk for the senior notes issued September 21, 2017.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows provided by financing activities decreased $6.2 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to net borrowings in 2017 used to finance the acquisition of Scripps Networks, offset by decreases in cash used to buy back stock and increases in issuances of commercial paper.\nCash flows provided by financing activities increased $7.1 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of senior notes which were used to finance the acquisition of Scripps Networks (see Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and a decrease in repurchases of stock of $771 million, offset by an increase in principal repayments of debt.\nCapital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2018, capital resources were comprised of the following (in millions).\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\nCapacity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding\nLetters of\nCredit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding\nIndebtedness\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unused\nCapacity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>986\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior notes (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Program financing line of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Interest on senior notes is paid annually, semi-annually or quarterly. Our senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2018 had interest rates that ranged from 1.90% to 6.35% and will mature between 2019 and 2047.\nWe expect that our cash balance, cash generated from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for the next twelve months. Our borrowing costs and access to the capital markets can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in part, on our performance as measured by credit metrics, such as interest coverage and leverage ratios.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we held $242 million of our $986 million of cash and cash equivalents in our foreign subsidiaries. The TCJA enacted on December 22, 2017 featured a participation exemption regime with current taxation of certain foreign income and imposes a mandatory repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings. The U.S. taxation of these amounts, notwithstanding, we intend to continue to reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to the U.S. However, if these funds are needed in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay non-U.S. taxes to repatriate them. The determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to these undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable.\nAdditional information regarding the changes in our outstanding indebtedness and the significant terms and provisions of our revolving credit facility and outstanding indebtedness is discussed in Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCOMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nObligations\nAs of December 31, 2018, our significant contractual obligations, including related payments due by period, were as follows (in millions).\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>564\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Content\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above table does not include certain long-term obligations as the timing or the amount of the payments cannot be predicted. For example, as of December 31, 2018, we have recorded $415 million for redeemable equity (see Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), although we are unable to predict reasonably the ultimate amount or timing of any payment. The current portion of the liability for cash-settled share-based compensation awards was $23 million as of December 31, 2018. Additionally, reserves for unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the above table because we are unable to predict reasonably the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. Our unrecognized tax benefits totaled $378 million as of December 31, 2018.\nThe above table also does not include DCL's revolving credit facility that, during the year ended December 31, 2018, allowed DCL and certain designated foreign subsidiaries of DCL to borrow up to $2.5 billion, including a $100 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $50 million sublimit for swingline loans. Borrowing capacity under this agreement is reduced by the outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program discussed below. As of December 31, 2018, the revolving credit facility agreement provided for a maturity date of August 11, 2022 and the option for up to two additional 364-day renewal periods.\nFrom time to time we may provide our equity method investees additional funding that has not been committed to as of December 31, 2018 based on unforeseen investee opportunities or cash flow needs. (See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nLong-term Debt\nPrincipal payments on long-term debt reflect the repayment of our outstanding senior notes, at face value, assuming repayment will occur upon maturity. Interest payments on our outstanding senior notes are projected based on their contractual rate and maturity.\nCapital Lease Obligations\nWe acquire satellite transponders and other equipment through multi-year capital lease arrangements. Principal payments on capital lease obligations reflect amounts due under our capital lease agreements. Interest payments on our outstanding capital lease obligations are based on the stated or implied rate in our capital lease agreements.\nOperating Lease Obligations\nWe obtain office space and equipment under multi-year lease arrangements. Most operating leases are not cancelable prior to their expiration. Payments for operating leases represent the amounts due under the agreements assuming the agreements are not canceled prior to their expiration.\nPurchase Obligations\nContent purchase obligations include commitments and liabilities associated with third-party producers and sports associations for content that airs on our television networks. Production contracts generally require: purchase of a specified number of episodes; payments over the term of the license; and include both programs that have been delivered and are available for airing and programs that have not yet been produced or sporting events that have not yet taken place. If the content is ultimately never produced, our commitments expire without obligation. The commitments disclosed above exclude content liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheet. We expect to enter into additional production contracts and content licenses to meet our future content needs.\nOther purchase obligations include agreements with certain vendors and suppliers for the purchase of goods and services whereby the underlying agreements are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms. Significant purchase obligations include transmission services, television rating services, marketing research, employment contracts, equipment purchases, and information technology and other services. The Company has contracts that do not require the purchase of fixed or minimum quantities and generally may be terminated with a 30-day to 60-day advance notice without penalty, and are not included in the table above past the 30-day to 60-day advance notice period. Amounts related to employment contracts include base compensation and do not include compensation contingent on future events.\nPut Rights\nThe Company has granted put rights to certain consolidated subsidiaries. Harpo, GoldenTree, Hasbro, Inc. (\"Hasbro\") and J:COM have the right to require the Company to purchase their remaining noncontrolling interests in OWN, MTG, Discovery Family and Discovery Japan, respectively. The Company recorded the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest in the equity associated with the put rights for OWN, MTG, Discovery Family and Discovery Japan as a component of redeemable noncontrolling interest in the amounts of $58 million, $121 million, $206 million and $30 million, respectively. (See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nPension Obligations\nWe sponsor a qualified defined benefit pension plan ( Pension Plan\u201d) that covers certain U.S.-based employees. We also have a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ( SERP\u201d).\nContractual commitments summarized in the contractual obligations table include payments to meet minimum funding requirements of our Pension Plan in 2019 and estimated benefit payments for our SERP. We do not anticipate contributing any cash to fund our Pension Plan in 2019. Payments for the SERP have been estimated over a ten-year period. Accordingly, the amounts in the over five years column include estimated payments for the 2024 through 2028 periods. While benefit payments under these plans are expected to continue beyond 2028, we believe it is not practicable to estimate payments beyond this period.\nNon-controlling Interest\nThe Food Network and Cooking Channel are operated and organized under the terms of the TV Food Network Partnership (the \"Partnership\"). The Company and a non-controlling owner hold interests in the Partnership. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Partnership agreement was extended and specifies a dissolution date of December 31, 2020. If the term of the Partnership is not extended prior to that date, the Partnership agreement permits the Company, as holder of 80% of the applicable votes, to reconstitute the Partnership and continue its business. If for some reason the Partnership is not continued, it will be required to limit its activities to winding up, settling debts, liquidating assets and distributing proceeds to the partners in proportion to their partnership interests.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K) that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into transactions with related parties, primarily our equity method investees and Liberty Media, Liberty Global, Liberty Interactive and Liberty Broadband (together, the \"Liberty Entities\"). Information regarding transactions and amounts with related parties is discussed in Note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNEW ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nWe adopted certain accounting and reporting standards during 2018. Information regarding our adoption of new accounting and reporting standards is discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and accompanying notes. Management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to reporting our financial condition and results of operations, and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. The development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. We consider policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies:\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Revenue recognition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Goodwill and intangible assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Income taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Business combinations (See Note 3);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Content rights; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Equity method investments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> With respect to our accounting policy for goodwill, we further supplement disclosures in Note 2 with the following:\nGoodwill is allocated to our reporting units, which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments (the component level). Reporting units are determined by the discrete financial information available for the component and whether it is regularly reviewed by segment management. Components are aggregated into a single reporting unit if they share similar economic characteristics. Our reporting units are as follows: U.S. Networks, Europe, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific.\nWe evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually as of November 30 or earlier upon the occurrence of substantive unfavorable changes in economic conditions, industry trends, costs, cash flows, or ongoing declines in market capitalization. The impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units, and the determination of fair value of each reporting unit if a quantitative test is performed. If we believe that as a result of our qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is not required.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units. This assessment included, but was not limited to, consideration of the results of the Company's most recent quantitative impairment test, consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, cash flows, changes in key personnel and the Company's share price. Based on this assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of those reporting units exceeded their carrying values, except for its Asia-Pacific reporting unit.\nBased on the results of the qualitative assessment, the Company performed a quantitative step 1 impairment test (comparison of fair value to carrying value) for its Asia-Pacific reporting unit, which indicated limited headroom (the excess of fair value over carrying value) of 10%. In performing the step 1 test, the Company determined the fair value of its Asia-Pacific reporting unit by using a combination of discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") analyses and market-based valuation methodologies. The results of these valuation methodologies were weighted 50% towards the DCF analyses and 50% towards the market-based approach. The models relied on significant judgments and assumptions surrounding general market conditions, short-term growth rates, a terminal growth rate of 2.5%, and detailed management forecasts of future cash flow projections. Fair values were determined primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows at a weighted average cost of capital of 12%. During our annual impairment testing, we evaluated the sensitivity of our most critical assumption, the discount rate, and determined that a 100 basis point change in the discount rate selected would not have impacted the test results. Additionally, the Company could reduce the terminal growth rate from its current 2.5% to 2.0% and the fair value of the Asia-Pacific reporting unit would still exceed its carrying value. As of December 31, 2018, the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the Asia-Pacific reporting unit was $188 million. Management will continue to monitor this reporting unit for changes in the business environment that could impact recoverability. The recoverability of goodwill is dependent upon the continued growth of cash flows from our business activities. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" for details on all significant risks that could impact the Company's ability to successfully grow its cash flows. Additionally, as the Asia-Pacific reporting unit operates in foreign markets with various functional currencies and has significant U.S. dollar denominated assets, changes in foreign exchange rates that result in strengthening of the U.S. dollar may negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit and the calculation of excess carrying value.\nFor an in-depth discussion of each of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies and further information regarding estimates and assumptions involved in their application, see Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition and results of operations for a global media company.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. This section provides additional information regarding our businesses, current developments, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, contractual commitments and critical accounting policies.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nWe are a global media company that provides content across multiple distribution platforms, including pay-TV, free to air (\"FTA\") and broadcast television, authenticated applications, digital distribution arrangements and content licensing agreements. Our portfolio of networks includes prominent television brands such as Discovery Channel, our most widely distributed global brand, TLC, Animal Planet, Food Network, HGTV, ID, MotorTrend (previously known as Velocity and known as Turbo outside of the U.S.) and Eurosport, a leading sports entertainment pay-TV programmer across Europe and Asia. We operate production studios, and prior to the sale of our Education Business on April 30, 2018, we sold curriculum-based education products and services (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nOur objectives are to invest in content for our networks to build viewership, optimize distribution revenue, capture advertising sales and create or reposition branded channels and businesses that can sustain long-term growth and occupy a desired content niche with strong consumer appeal. Our strategy is to maximize the distribution, ratings and profit potential of each of our branded networks. In addition to growing distribution and advertising revenues for our branded networks, we are extending content distribution across new platforms, including brand-aligned websites, on-line streaming, mobile devices, VOD and broadband channels, which provide promotional platforms for our television content and serve as additional outlets for advertising and distribution revenue. Audience ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenue and creating demand on the part of cable television operators, DTH satellite operators, telecommunication service providers, and other content distributors, that deliver our content to their customers.\nOur content spans genres including survival, exploration, sports, general entertainment, home, food and travel, heroes, adventure, crime and investigation, health and kids. We have an extensive library of high-definition content and own rights to much of our content and footage, which enables us to exploit our library to launch brands and services into new markets quickly. Our content can be re-edited and updated in a cost-effective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world on a variety of platforms.\nAlthough the Company utilizes certain brands and content globally, we classify our operations in two reportable segments: U.S. Networks, consisting principally of domestic television networks and digital distribution arrangements, and International Networks, consisting primarily of international television networks and digital distribution arrangements. In addition, Education and Other consists principally of a production studio, and prior to the sale of the Education Business on April 30, 2018, curriculum-based education products and services (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) Our segment presentation aligns with our management structure and the financial information management uses to make strategic and operating decisions, such as the allocation of resources and business performance assessments. For further discussion of our Company, segments in which we do business, and our content development activities and revenues, see our business overview set forth in Item 1, \"Business\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2018 vs. 2017\nThe discussion below compares our actual and pro forma combined results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, as if the OWN and MTG transactions and the acquisition of Scripps Networks (collectively, \"the Transactions\") occurred on January 1, 2017. Management believes reviewing our actual operating results in addition to combined pro forma results is useful in identifying trends in, or reaching conclusions regarding, the overall operating performance of our businesses. This information has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, is not intended to be a substitute for or superior to GAAP. Please see our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Our combined U.S. Networks, International Networks and Corporate and Inter-Segment Eliminations pro forma information is based on the historical operating results of the respective businesses as applicable to each segment and includes adjustments directly attributable to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2017, such as:\n 1. The impact of the purchase price allocation to the fair value of assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests, such as intangible amortization; \n 2. Adjustments to remove items associated with the Transactions that will not have a continuing impact on the combined entity, such as transaction costs and the impact of employee retention agreements; and \n 3. Changes to align accounting policies \nAdjustments do not include costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. Pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of what our results would have been had we operated the acquired businesses since January 1, 2017 and should not be taken as indicative of the Company's future consolidated results of operations.\nActual amounts for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 include the results of operations for the Discovery and Scripps Networks, OWN and MTG businesses for the period since each respective transaction. Scripps Networks was acquired on March 6, 2018, OWN was consolidated on November 30, 2017 and MTG was consolidated on September 25, 2017.\nConsolidated Results of Operations - 2018 vs. 2017\nOur consolidated results of operations for 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in millions).\n\nNM - Not meaningful\nRevenues\nDistribution revenue consists principally of fees from affiliates for distributing our linear networks, supplemented by revenue earned from SVOD content licensing and other emerging forms of digital distribution. Distribution revenue increased 31%, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. Excluding the impact of the Transactions and on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, distribution revenue increased 3%. Increases at International Networks were primarily driven by increases in subscribers to our linear networks and higher digital subscription revenues and increases in pricing in Europe and Latin America. Increases at U.S. Networks were principally attributable to an increase in contractual affiliate rates, which was partially offset by a decline in subscribers and, to a lesser extent, the timing of content deliveries under SVOD arrangements.\nAdvertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the stage of development of television markets, the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content, our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels, market demand, the mix in sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets and economic conditions. These factors impact the pricing and volume of our advertising inventory. Advertising revenue increased 79%, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. Excluding the impact of the Transactions and on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, advertising revenue increased 3%. The increases were due to continued monetization of our digital content offerings, an increase in pricing at U.S. Networks, and the Olympics.\nOther revenue increased 54%, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. Excluding the impact of the Transactions and on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, other revenue increased 8%. The increases were primarily due to sublicensing of Olympics sports rights to broadcast networks throughout Europe, partially offset by the Education and Other revenue that decreased 66% following the disposition of the Education Business on April 30, 2018. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nRevenue for our segments is discussed separately below under the heading Segment Results of Operations.\u201d\nCosts of Revenues\nCosts of revenues increased 48%, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. The Company's principal component of costs of revenues is content expense. Content expense includes television series, television specials, films, sporting events and digital products. The costs of producing a content asset and bringing that asset to market consist of film costs, participation costs, exploitation costs and manufacturing costs. Content rights expense excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations was $2.9 billion and $1.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding the impact of the Transactions and foreign currency fluctuations, costs of revenue increased 5%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and on a pro forma combined basis, costs of revenues increased 2%. The increases were primarily due to spending on the Olympics at International Networks, partially offset by the impact of higher content impairment expenses recorded in the prior year at U.S. Networks and the impact of the disposition of the Education Business. On a pro forma combined basis and excluding the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations, content expense was $3.0 billion for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Content impairment is generally a component of costs of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. However, during the year ended December 31, 2018, content impairments of $405 million were reflected as a component of restructuring and other charges as a result of the strategic programming changes following the acquisition of Scripps Networks. No content impairments were recorded as a component of restructuring and other charges during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs, marketing costs, research costs, occupancy and back office support fees. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 48%, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. Excluding the impact of the Transactions, directly related third-party transaction and planned integration costs and foreign currency fluctuations, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6%, primarily due to increased marketing spend at International Networks, increased share-based compensation expense, charge-backs to an equity method investee in the prior year that is now consolidated, and increases in technology costs and tax advisory fees, partially offset by decreases at Education and Other following the disposition of the Education Business on April 30, 2018. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and on a pro forma combined basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were largely consistent with the prior year.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nNo goodwill impairment expense was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018. Goodwill impairment expense of $1.3 billion was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017. (See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization increased $1.1 billion, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. On a pro forma combined basis, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $249 million, primarily due to pro forma amortization in 2017 related to the ad revenue backlog intangible, which had a one-year useful life and was fully amortized on a pro forma basis in 2017.\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nRestructuring and other charges increased $675 million, primarily as a result of content impairments associated with changes in programming strategies, involuntary severance actions associated with the integration of Scripps Networks, costs associated with the termination of long-term programming arrangements, and lease exit costs. (See Note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) On a pro forma combined basis, restructuring and other charges increased $685 million. We expect to incur additional restructuring and integration expenses related to employee and contract terminations, relocation from the Company's Silver Spring headquarters to New York City, and content costs.\n(Gain) Loss on Disposition\nWe recorded an $84 million gain during the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the sale of a controlling stake in the Education Business on April 30, 2018, compared with a loss of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the disposition of the Raw and Betty production studios. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $254 million, primarily due to interest accrued on higher debt balances, including the senior notes issued on September 21, 2017 and term loans outstanding from March 6, 2018 through September 30, 2018. The senior notes and term loans were used to effect the acquisition of Scripps Networks. (See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nOn March 13, 2017, we issued new senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $650 million and used the proceeds to fund the repurchase of $600 million of combined aggregate principal amount of our then-outstanding senior notes through a cash tender offer that closed on March 13, 2017. As a result, we recognized a $54 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which included $50 million for premiums to par value, $2 million of non-cash write-offs of unamortized deferred financing costs, $1 million for the write-off of the original issue discount of these senior notes and $1 million accrued for other third-party fees. (See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nLoss from equity investees, net\nThe loss from our equity method investees decreased $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a reduction in losses from investments in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy, and to a lesser extent, inclusion of equity earnings as a result of the acquisition of Scripps Networks, partially offset by the absence of earnings from the Company's equity method investment in OWN and impairments of $29 million. (See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nOther Expense, Net\nThe table below presents the details of other income (expense), net (in millions).\n\nTotal other expense, net increased $10 million in 2018 compared to 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018 we recorded losses on common stock investments with readily determinable fair value due to the adoption of the recognition and measurement of financial instruments guidance on January 1, 2018, which requires us to record gains and losses on equity investments with readily determinable fair values in other expense, net. Previously, unrealized gains and losses were recorded in other comprehensive income. The increase in foreign currency losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 was mostly related to remeasurement of net monetary assets and transactions associated with the Polish Zloty, the Euro and other European currencies, partially offset by a reduction in losses associated with the British Pound. We recorded gains on derivative instruments for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to losses for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to losses of $98 million recorded during the prior year on interest rate contracts used to economically hedge the pricing for the issuance of a portion of the dollar-denominated senior notes on September 21, 2017 and, to a lesser extent, gains recorded in the current year on the equity collar used to mitigate the risk of market fluctuations with respect to 50% of the Lionsgate shares held by the Company and foreign currency swaps. (See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) On November 30, 2017, the Company acquired from Harpo a controlling interest in OWN. We recognized a remeasurement gain of $33 million to account for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of previously held 49.50% equity interest. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table reconciles the Company's effective income tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate.\n\nIncome tax expense was $341 million and $176 million and our effective tax rate was 33% and (128)% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. During 2018, the increase in the income tax expense was primarily attributable to an increase in income, a reduction in benefits from investment tax credits from our renewable energy investments, the effect of foreign operations, which included the establishment of valuation allowances and write-offs of deferred tax assets, and elimination of the domestic production activity deduction, partially offset by the lower U.S. Federal statutory income tax rate, a decrease in expense for uncertain tax positions, and a tax benefit from TCJA rate change on the deferred tax liability recomputation as a result of U.S. legislative changes that extended the accelerated deduction of qualified film productions.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Scripps Networks, we recorded reserves in purchase accounting totaling $110 million for foreign tax matters claimed by tax authorities that are currently pending resolution. After the purchase accounting measurement period closes on March 5, 2019, any adjustment to these estimated amounts resulting from their resolution will affect net income in the period resolved.\nSegment Results of Operations - 2018 vs. 2017\nWe evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and Adjusted OIBDA. Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income excluding: (i) mark-to-market share-based compensation, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) restructuring and other charges, (iv) certain impairment charges, (v) gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, (vi) certain inter-segment eliminations related to production studios, and (vii) third-party transaction costs directly related to the acquisition and integration of Scripps Networks. We use this measure to assess the operating results and performance of our segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance, and allocate resources to each segment. We believe Adjusted OIBDA is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. We exclude mark-to-market share-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, certain impairment charges, gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and Scripps Networks acquisition and integration costs from the calculation of Adjusted OIBDA due to their impact on comparability between periods. We also exclude the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets and deferred launch incentives as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. Certain corporate expenses and inter-segment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives.\nAdjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, operating income, net income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d).\nAdditional financial information for our segments and geographical areas in which we do business is discussed in Note 23 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe table below presents our Adjusted OIBDA by segment, with a reconciliation of consolidated net income available to Discovery, Inc. to total Adjusted OIBDA (in millions).\n\nThe table below presents the calculation of total Adjusted OIBDA (in millions).\n\n(a) Selling, general and administrative expenses exclude mark-to-market share-based compensation and Scripps Networks transaction and integration costs due to their impact on comparability between periods.\nEffective January 1, 2019, our definition of Adjusted OIBDA was modified to exclude all share-based compensation, whereas only mark-to-market share-based compensation is excluded for each of the periods presented herein. During 2018, the Company began granting a higher percentage of equity classified awards (in lieu of liability classified awards, which require mark-to-market accounting) under its stock incentive plans, and expects to continue this action in future periods. Since most equity classified awards are non-cash expenses not entirely under management control, the Company has elected to exclude all share-based compensation from Adjusted OIBDA beginning in 2019. The revised definition of Adjusted OIBDA will be used by our chief operating decision maker in evaluating segment performance in 2019.\nThe following table presents Adjusted OIBDA as historically reported and under the revised definition:\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

earned from SVOD content licensing and other emerging forms of digital distribution. Distribution revenue increased 31%, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. Excluding the impact of the Transactions and on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, distribution revenue increased 3%. Increases at International Networks were primarily driven by increases in subscribers to our linear networks and higher digital subscription revenues and increases in pricing in Europe and Latin America. Increases at U.S. Networks were principally attributable to an increase in contractual affiliate rates, which was partially offset by a decline in subscribers and, to a lesser extent, the timing of content deliveries under SVOD arrangements.\nAdvertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the stage of development of television markets, the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content, our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels, market demand, the mix in sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets and economic conditions. These factors impact the pricing and volume of our advertising inventory. Advertising revenue increased 79%, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. Excluding the impact of the Transactions and on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, advertising revenue increased 3%. The increases were due to continued monetization of our digital content offerings, an increase in pricing at U.S. Networks, and the Olympics.\nOther revenue increased 54%, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. Excluding the impact of the Transactions and on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, other revenue increased 8%. The increases were primarily due to sublicensing of Olympics sports rights to broadcast networks throughout Europe, partially offset by the Education and Other revenue that decreased 66% following the disposition of the Education Business on April 30, 2018. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nRevenue for our segments is discussed separately below under the heading Segment Results of Operations.\u201d\nCosts of Revenues\nCosts of revenues increased 48%, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. The Company's principal component of costs of revenues is content expense. Content expense includes television series, television specials, films, sporting events and digital products. The costs of producing a content asset and bringing that asset to market consist of film costs, participation costs, exploitation costs and manufacturing costs. Content rights expense excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations was $2.9 billion and $1.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding the impact of the Transactions and foreign currency fluctuations, costs of revenue increased 5%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and on a pro forma combined basis, costs of revenues increased 2%. The increases were primarily due to spending on the Olympics at International Networks, partially offset by the impact of higher content impairment expenses recorded in the prior year at U.S. Networks and the impact of the disposition of the Education Business. On a pro forma combined basis and excluding the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations, content expense was $3.0 billion for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Content impairment is generally a component of costs of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. However, during the year ended December 31, 2018, content impairments of $405 million were reflected as a component of restructuring and other charges as a result of the strategic programming changes following the acquisition of Scripps Networks. No content impairments were recorded as a component of restructuring and other charges during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs, marketing costs, research costs, occupancy and back office support fees. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 48%, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. Excluding the impact of the Transactions, directly related third-party transaction and planned integration costs and foreign currency fluctuations, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6%, primarily due to increased marketing spend at International Networks, increased share-based compensation expense, charge-backs to an equity method investee in the prior year that is now consolidated, and increases in technology costs and tax advisory fees, partially offset by decreases at Education and Other following the disposition of the Education Business on April 30, 2018. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and on a pro forma combined basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were largely consistent with the prior year.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nNo goodwill impairment expense was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018. Goodwill impairment expense of $1.3 billion was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017. (See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization increased $1.1 billion, primarily due to the impact of the Transactions. On a pro forma combined basis, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $249 million, primarily due to pro forma amortization in 2017 related to the ad revenue backlog intangible, which had a one-year useful life and was fully amortized on a pro forma basis in 2017.\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nRestructuring and other charges increased $675 million, primarily as a result of content impairments associated with changes in programming strategies, involuntary severance actions associated with the integration of Scripps Networks, costs associated with the termination of long-term programming arrangements, and lease exit costs. (See Note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) On a pro forma combined basis, restructuring and other charges increased $685 million. We expect to incur additional restructuring and integration expenses related to employee and contract terminations, relocation from the Company's Silver Spring headquarters to New York City, and content costs.\n(Gain) Loss on Disposition\nWe recorded an $84 million gain during the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the sale of a controlling stake in the Education Business on April 30, 2018, compared with a loss of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the disposition of the Raw and Betty production studios. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $254 million, primarily due to interest accrued on higher debt balances, including the senior notes issued on September 21, 2017 and term loans outstanding from March 6, 2018 through September 30, 2018. The senior notes and term loans were used to effect the acquisition of Scripps Networks. (See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nOn March 13, 2017, we issued new senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $650 million and used the proceeds to fund the repurchase of $600 million of combined aggregate principal amount of our then-outstanding senior notes through a cash tender offer that closed on March 13, 2017. As a result, we recognized a $54 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which included $50 million for premiums to par value, $2 million of non-cash write-offs of unamortized deferred financing costs, $1 million for the write-off of the original issue discount of these senior notes and $1 million accrued for other third-party fees. (See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nLoss from equity investees, net\nThe loss from our equity method investees decreased $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a reduction in losses from investments in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy, and to a lesser extent, inclusion of equity earnings as a result of the acquisition of Scripps Networks, partially offset by the absence of earnings from the Company's equity method investment in OWN and impairments of $29 million. (See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nOther Expense, Net\nThe table below presents the details of other income (expense), net (in millions).\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency losses, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(93\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(83\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains (losses) on derivative instruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(82\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in the value of common stock investments with readily determinable fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(88\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remeasurement gain on previously held equity interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (expense) income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(120\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(110\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal other expense, net increased $10 million in 2018 compared to 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018 we recorded losses on common stock investments with readily determinable fair value due to the adoption of the recognition and measurement of financial instruments guidance on January 1, 2018, which requires us to record gains and losses on equity investments with readily determinable fair values in other expense, net. Previously, unrealized gains and losses were recorded in other comprehensive income. The increase in foreign currency losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 was mostly related to remeasurement of net monetary assets and transactions associated with the Polish Zloty, the Euro and other European currencies, partially offset by a reduction in losses associated with the British Pound. We recorded gains on derivative instruments for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to losses for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to losses of $98 million recorded during the prior year on interest rate contracts used to economically hedge the pricing for the issuance of a portion of the dollar-denominated senior notes on September 21, 2017 and, to a lesser extent, gains recorded in the current year on the equity collar used to mitigate the risk of market fluctuations with respect to 50% of the Lionsgate shares held by the Company and foreign currency swaps. (See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) On November 30, 2017, the Company acquired from Harpo a controlling interest in OWN. We recognized a remeasurement gain of $33 million to account for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of previously held 49.50% equity interest. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table reconciles the Company's effective income tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate.\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. federal statutory income tax provision\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(48\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State and local income taxes, net of federal tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic production activity deductions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in uncertain tax positions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred stock modification\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(334\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Renewable energy investments tax credits (See Note 4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(195\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncontrolling interest adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Legislative Changes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-deductible compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(128\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome tax expense was $341 million and $176 million and our effective tax rate was 33% and (128)% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. During 2018, the increase in the income tax expense was primarily attributable to an increase in income, a reduction in benefits from investment tax credits from our renewable energy investments, the effect of foreign operations, which included the establishment of valuation allowances and write-offs of deferred tax assets, and elimination of the domestic production activity deduction, partially offset by the lower U.S. Federal statutory income tax rate, a decrease in expense for uncertain tax positions, and a tax benefit from TCJA rate change on the deferred tax liability recomputation as a result of U.S. legislative changes that extended the accelerated deduction of qualified film productions.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Scripps Networks, we recorded reserves in purchase accounting totaling $110 million for foreign tax matters claimed by tax authorities that are currently pending resolution. After the purchase accounting measurement period closes on March 5, 2019, any adjustment to these estimated amounts resulting from their resolution will affect net income in the period resolved.\nSegment Results of Operations - 2018 vs. 2017\nWe evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and Adjusted OIBDA. Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income excluding: (i) mark-to-market share-based compensation, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) restructuring and other charges, (iv) certain impairment charges, (v) gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, (vi) certain inter-segment eliminations related to production studios, and (vii) third-party transaction costs directly related to the acquisition and integration of Scripps Networks. We use this measure to assess the operating results and performance of our segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance, and allocate resources to each segment. We believe Adjusted OIBDA is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. We exclude mark-to-market share-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, certain impairment charges, gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and Scripps Networks acquisition and integration costs from the calculation of Adjusted OIBDA due to their impact on comparability between periods. We also exclude the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets and deferred launch incentives as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. Certain corporate expenses and inter-segment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives.\nAdjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, operating income, net income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d).\nAdditional financial information for our segments and geographical areas in which we do business is discussed in Note 23 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe table below presents our Adjusted

</tr>\n</table>\n(a) Selling, general and administrative expenses exclude mark-to-market share-based compensation and Scripps Networks transaction and integration costs due to their impact on comparability between periods.\nEffective January 1, 2019, our definition of Adjusted OIBDA was modified to exclude all share-based compensation, whereas only mark-to-market share-based compensation is excluded for each of the periods presented herein. During 2018, the Company began granting a higher percentage of equity classified awards (in lieu of liability classified awards, which require mark-to-market accounting) under its stock incentive plans, and expects to continue this action in future periods. Since most equity classified awards are non-cash expenses not entirely under management control, the Company has elected to exclude all share-based compensation from Adjusted OIBDA beginning in 2019. The revised definition of Adjusted OIBDA will be used by our chief operating decision maker in evaluating segment performance in 2019.\nThe following table presents Adjusted OIBDA as historically reported and under the revised definition:\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Networks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International Networks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Education and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Corporate and inter-segment eliminations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA, as reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(441\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deduct: Mark-to-market share-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Total share-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA, as"}
