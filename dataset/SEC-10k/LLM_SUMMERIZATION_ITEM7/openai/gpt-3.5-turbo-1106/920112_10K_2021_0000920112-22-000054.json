MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of HTLF as of the dates and for the periods indicated is presented below. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial data appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HTLF and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned.\nFor a discussion of 2019 results of operations, including a discussion of the financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, refer to Part I, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Among other things, the estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Refer to Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" for further discussion on HTLF's critical accounting policies.\nThe estimates and judgments that management believes have the most effect on HTLF's reported financial position and results of operations are as follows:\nAllowance For Credit Losses\nThe process utilized by HTLF to estimate the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate for HTLF. The allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of identified and unidentified current expected credit losses in the existing loan portfolio. Therefore, the accuracy of this estimate could have a material impact on HTLF's earnings.\nFor certain commercial and agricultural loans and any related unfunded loan commitments, the expected credit losses are calculated on a pool basis through a transition matrix model derived life of loan probability of default and loss given default methodology. The probability of default and loss given default methodology have been developed using HTLF's historical loss experience over the look back period, currently over the most recent 13 years. For smaller commercial and agricultural loans, residential real estate loans and consumer loans and any related unfunded loan commitments, a lifetime average historical loss rate is established for each pool of loans based upon an average loss rate calculated using HTLF historical loss experience over the look back-period. The loss rates used in the allowance calculation are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted to reflect changes in historical loss levels or other risks.\nIf a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with other loans in the pool, it is evaluated on an individual basis and is not included in the collective evaluation. All individually assessed loan calculations are completed at least semi-annually.\nHTLF's allowance methodology also has a qualitative component, the purpose of which is to provide management with a means to take into consideration changes in current conditions that could potentially have an effect, up or down, on the level of recognized loan losses, that, for whatever reason, may not be represented in the quantitative analysis performed in determining its base loan loss rates.\nAdditionally, our allowance calculation utilizes an overlay approach for its economic forecasting component, similar to the method utilized for the qualitative factors. The length of the reasonable and supportable forecast period is a judgmental determination based on the level to which HTLF can reasonably support its forecast of economic conditions that drive its estimate of expected loss.\nThe economic indices utilized from the economic forecast include the national unemployment rate, national gross domestic product, capacity index manufacturing growth, national commercial real estate price index, national home price index and the national farm products price index. The economic indices utilized in the calculation which may be the most sensitive in the allowance calculation are the national unemployment rate and the national gross domestic product because management believes changes in these indices, positive or negative, will be impactful to all loan pools.\nThe appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is monitored on an ongoing basis by the credit administration group, loan review staff, executive and senior management and the boards of directors of HTLF and each Bank. There can be no assurances that the allowance for credit losses will be adequate to cover all current expected credit losses, but management believes that the allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 2021. While management uses available information to provide for credit losses, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of the loan portfolio and the need for future additions to the allowance will be based on changes in economic conditions.\nShould the economic climate deteriorate, borrowers may experience financial difficulty, and the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs, and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the provision for credit losses. Conversely, improvement in credit quality and economic conditions may allow for a reduction of provision for credit losses. Any unanticipated changes, positive or negative, could have a significant impact on the results of operations.\nIn addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for credit losses carried by the Banks. Such agencies may require us to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations.\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill and Core Deposit Intangibles\nWe record all assets and liabilities purchased in an acquisition, including intangibles, at fair value. Determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired often involves estimates based on third-party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include the use of estimates. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized but are subject to, at a minimum, annual tests for impairment. In certain situations, interim impairment tests may be required if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Core deposit intangibles assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using straight-line and accelerated methods and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount.\nThe initial fair value measurement of loans and core deposit intangibles require us to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future using valuation methods. The fair value of acquired loans is based on a discounted cash flow methodology that projects principal and interest payments using key assumptions related to the discount rate and loss rates. The fair value of core deposit intangibles is based on the cost savings approach under a discounted cash flow methodology, whereby projected net cash flow benefits are derived from estimating costs to carry deposits compared to alternative funding costs, and includes key assumptions related to the discount rate, deposit attrition rates and net costs, including discounted cash flow analyses. Events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include, among others, competitive forces, customer behaviors, changes in revenue growth trends, cost structures, technology, changes in discount rates and market conditions. In determining the reasonableness of cash flow estimates, HTLF reviews historical performance of the underlying assets or similar assets in an effort to assess and validate assumptions utilized in its estimates.\nOVERVIEW\nHTLF is a multi-bank holding company providing banking, mortgage, wealth management, investments and insurance services to businesses and consumers. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, HTLF has eleven separately chartered banking subsidiaries with 129 locations in Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Arizona, Montana, Colorado, Minnesota, Kansas, Missouri, Texas and California. Our primary objectives are to increase profitability and diversify our deposits, assets and overall customer base through organic growth and acquisitions in the Bank Markets we serve.\nOur results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities. Noninterest income, which includes service charges and fees, loan servicing income, trust fees, brokerage and insurance commissions, securities gains, net, net gains on sale of loans held for sale and income on bank owned life insurance also affects our results of operations. Our principal operating expenses, aside from interest expense, consist of the provision for credit losses, salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, furniture and equipment costs, professional fees, advertising, core deposit intangibles and customer relationship intangibles amortization, other real estate and loan collection expenses and acquisition, integration and restructuring costs.\n2021 Overview\nNet income available to common stockholders was $211.9 million, or $5.00 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $133.5 million or $3.57 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Subsequent to the systems conversion, seven of AimBank's twenty-five bank branches were transferred to HTLF's New Mexico Bank & Trust subsidiary.\nBranding Change\nOn April 14, 2021, a branding change from Heartland Financial to HTLF was announced and rolled out across the organization. The branding was refreshed to better reflect the financial and non-financial strengths of HTLF, including a diverse footprint and the continued growth of the company.\nPaycheck Protection Program Loans\nHTLF originated a second round of Paycheck Protection Program loans (\"PPP II\") totaling $473.9 million since the beginning of 2021. PPP II loans are 100% United States SBA guaranteed, and borrowers may be eligible to have an amount up to the entire principal balance forgiven and paid by the SBA. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 98% of PPP loans originated in 2020 (\"PPP I\") loans have been forgiven, and approximately 63% of PPP II loans have been forgiven.\nTotal interest income on PPP loans increased $15.3 million or 61% to $40.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIssuance of Subordinated Debt\nOn September 8, 2021, HTLF closed its public offering of $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.75% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2031 (the \"2021 subordinated notes\"). The 2021 subordinated notes were issued at par with an underwriting discount of $1.9 million, and the net proceeds totaled $147.6 million. The 2021 subordinated notes were registered under HTLF's effective shelf registration statement and qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. The net proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes, which includes, without limitation, providing capital to support HTLF's organic growth or growth through strategic acquisitions, financing investments, capital expenditures, investments in the subsidiary banks as regulatory capital, and repaying indebtedness. The 2021 subordinated notes have a fixed interest rate of 2.75% until September 15, 2026, at which time the interest rate will be reset quarterly to a benchmark interest rate, which is expected to be three-month term Secure Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") plus a spread of 210 basis points. The 2021 subordinated notes mature on September 15, 2031, and become redeemable at HTLF's option on September 15, 2026.\nBranch Optimization\nDuring 2021, HTLF consolidated eight legacy bank branches, which included two branches in Midwestern markets, four branches in Southwestern markets, and five branches in Western markets, and sold one branch in a Midwestern market as it continues to respond to customer preferences and closely manage expenses. HTLF plans to reduce branch locations by approximately 10% in 2022 through closures, consolidations or sales. HTLF continues to review its branch network for optimization and consolidation opportunities, which may result in additional write-downs of fixed assets in future periods.\nCommon Stock Dividend Increase\nSince 2020, the common stock dividend has been increased from $0.20 per common share in each quarter of 2020 to $0.22 for the first and second quarters of 2021, $0.25 for the third quarter of 2021, and $0.27 per common share in fourth quarter of 2021.\nCharter Consolidation\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, HTLF completed evaluating the consolidation of its eleven bank charters as part of its ongoing efforts to improve operational efficiency. As a result, the HTLF Board of Directors approved a plan to consolidate its eleven bank charters into a single Colorado based charter, \"HTLF Bank,\" that will continue to operate under separate bank brands in each market. The plan is subject to regulatory approval.\nThe consolidation project is underway and is expected to be completed by the end of 2023. The first bank consolidation is expected to occur in mid-2022. The estimated restructuring costs of the project are approximately $20.0 million, of which $1.9 million was incurred in 2021. The ongoing financial benefits from consolidation are expected to be approximately $20.0 million annually when the project is completed and are expected to arise from the elimination of redundancies and improved operating processes. The consolidation will also increase operating capacity to be leveraged with future growth and provide better alignment of our products and services.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Update\nIn March 2020, the outbreak of the novel COVID-19 was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The spread of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity in the United States and globally in 2021 and 2020.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, HTLF implemented and continues to operate under its pandemic management plan to assure workplace and employee safety and business resiliency, and the pandemic management plan continues to evolve in response to the recent developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HTLF's financial condition and results of operations will depend on the severity and duration of the pandemic, including the emergence of COVID-19 variants, related restrictions on business and consumer activity, efficacy and distribution of vaccines and the availability of government programs to alleviate the economic stress of the pandemic. See \"COVID-19 Pandemic Risks\" in Part 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2020 Developments\nAdoption of ASU 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)\"\nOn January 1, 2020, HTLF adopted ASU 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),\" commonly referred to as \"CECL.\" The impact of HTLF's adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020 (\"Day 1\") resulted in the following:\n\u2022an increase of $12.1 million to the allowance for credit losses related to loans, which included a reclassification of $6.0 million of purchased credit impaired loan discount on previously acquired loans, and a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings totaling $4.6 million, net of taxes of $1.5 million;\n\u2022an increase of $13.6 million to the allowance for unfunded commitments and a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings totaling $10.2 million, net of taxes of $3.4 million, and\n\u2022established an allowance for credit losses for HTLF's held to maturity debt securities of $158,000 and a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings totaling $118,000, net of taxes of $40,000.\nThe allowance calculation under CECL is an expected loss model, which encompasses expected losses over the life of the loan and held to maturity securities portfolios, including expected losses due to changes in economic conditions and forecasts, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information, see Note 1, \"Basis of Presentation\" and Note 6, \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" to the consolidated financial statements contained herein.\nIssued $115.0 Million of Preferred Equity\nOn June 26, 2020, HTLF issued and sold 4.6 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/400th interest in a share of 7.00% Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series E. The depositary shares are listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \"HTLFP.\" The net proceeds of $110.7 million are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include organic and acquired growth, financing investments, capital expenditures, investments in wholly-owned subsidiaries as regulatory capital and repayment of debt.\nBranch Optimization\nIn the second half of 2020, HTLF's member banks approved plans to consolidate eight branch locations, which included two branches in the Midwest region, five branches in the Western region and one in the Southwestern region and resulted in $1.2 million and $2.3 million of fixed asset write-downs in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively. The branch consolidations were completed in early 2021.\nJohnson Bank Arizona Operations Purchase and Assumption\nOn December 4, 2020, Arizona Bank & Trust (\"AB&T\"), HTLF's wholly-owned subsidiary headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, acquired certain assets and assumed substantially all of the deposits and certain other liabilities of Johnson Bank's Arizona operations, which included four branches. Johnson Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson Financial Group, Inc. headquartered in Racine, Wisconsin. As of the closing date, AB&T acquired, at fair value, total assets of $419.7 million, which included gross loans of $150.7 million, and deposits of $415.5 million. The systems conversion occurred simultaneously with the closing of the transaction.\nAimBank Acquisition\nOn December 4, 2020, HTLF completed the acquisition of AimBank, headquartered in Levelland, Texas. Based on HTLF's closing common stock price of $41.89 on December 4, 2020, the aggregate consideration paid to AimBank common shareholders was $264.5 million, which was paid by delivery of common stock of $217.2 million and cash of $47.3 million, subject to certain hold-back provisions of the merger agreement relating to the cash consideration. AimBank was merged with and into HTLF's wholly-owned Texas subsidiary, First Bank and Trust, and the combined entity operates as First Bank and Trust. As of the closing date, AimBank had, at fair value, total assets of $1.97 billion, which included gross loans of $1.09 billion, and deposits of $1.67 billion. The systems conversion for this transaction occurred in February 2021.\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

references to financial measures which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Management believes the non-GAAP measures are helpful for investors to analyze and evaluate HTLF's financial condition and operating results. However, these non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and should not be considered a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, because non-GAAP measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare the non-GAAP measures presented in this section with other companies' non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of each non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure may be found in the financial tables above.\nThe non-GAAP measures presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management's reason for including each measure and the method of calculating each measure are presented below:\n\u2022Tangible book value per common share is total common equity less goodwill and core deposit and customer relationship intangibles, net, divided by common shares outstanding, net of treasury. This measure is included as it is considered to be a critical metric to analyze and evaluate use of equity, financial condition and capital strength.\n\u2022Tangible common equity ratio is total common equity less goodwill and core deposit and customer relationship intangibles, net, divided by total assets less goodwill and core deposit and customer relationship intangibles, net. This measure is included as it is considered to be a critical metric to analyze and evaluate financial condition and capital strength.\n\u2022Annualized return on average tangible common equity is net income excluding intangible amortization calculated as (1) net income excluding tax-effected core deposit and customer relationship intangibles amortization, divided by (2) average common equity less goodwill and core deposit and customer relationship intangibles, net. This measure is included as it is considered to be a critical metric to analyze and evaluate use of equity, financial condition and capital strength.\n\u2022Net interest income, fully tax equivalent, is net income adjusted for the tax-favored status of certain loans and securities. Management believes this measure enhances the comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.\n\u2022Annualized net interest margin, fully tax-equivalent, adjusts net interest income for the tax-favored status of certain loans and securities. Management believes this measure enhances the comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.\n\u2022Efficiency ratio, fully tax equivalent, expresses noninterest expenses as a percentage of fully tax-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income. This efficiency ratio is presented on a tax-equivalent basis which adjusts net interest income and noninterest expenses for the tax favored status of certain loans, securities, and tax credit projects. Management believes the presentation of this non-GAAP measure provides supplemental useful information for proper understanding of the financial results as it enhances the comparability of income and expenses arising from taxable and nontaxable sources and excludes specific items as noted in the reconciliation contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022Organic deposit growth is exclusive of deposits obtained through acquisitions. Management believes that this measure provides a more complete understanding of underlying trends in deposit growth notwithstanding acquisitions.\n\u2022Organic loan growth is exclusive of loans obtained through acquisitions and PPP loans. Management believes that this measure provides a more complete understanding of underlying trends in loan growth notwithstanding acquisitions.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Interest Margin and Net Interest Income\nHTLF's management monitors and manages net interest income and net interest margin and shares the results with investors because they are key indicators of HTLF's profitability and growth of earning assets.\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income earned on earning assets and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities. As such, net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and yields on earning assets and the volume and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets.\nOur success in maintaining competitive net interest margin despite the low-interest rate environment has been the result of an increase in average earning assets, including earning assets acquired in recent acquisitions and PPP loans, and a favorable deposit mix. Also contributing to our ability to maintain net interest margin has been the amortization of purchase accounting discounts associated with acquisitions completed since 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our net interest margin included 9 basis points, 12 basis points and 18 basis points, respectively, of purchase accounting discount amortization.\nSee \"Analysis of Average Balances, Tax-Equivalent Yields and Rates\" for a description of our use of net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis, which is not defined by GAAP, and a reconciliation of annualized net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis to GAAP.\nNet interest margin, expressed as a percentage of average earning assets, was 3.29% (3.33% on a fully tax-equivalent basis) during 2021, compared to 3.65% (3.69% on a fully tax-equivalent basis) during 2020 and 4.00% (4.04% on a fully tax-equivalent basis) during 2019. Excluding the impact of PPP loans, HTLF's net interest margin on a fully-tax equivalent basis (non-GAAP) was 3.24% during 2021 compared to 3.72% during 2020.\nTotal interest income and average earning asset changes for 2021 compared to 2020 were:\n\u2022Total interest income increased $52.1 million or 10% to $588.8 million from $536.6 million due to an increase in average earning assets, which was partially offset by a decrease in the average rate on earning assets.\n\u2022Total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis (non-GAAP) was $596.0 million compared to $542.1 million, which was an increase of $53.9 million or 10%.\n\u2022Average earning assets increased $3.54 billion or 26% to $17.03 billion from $13.48 billion, which was primarily attributable to recent acquisitions, increases in securities and loan growth.\n\u2022The average rate on earning assets decreased 52 basis points to 3.50% compared to 4.02%, which was primarily due to recent decreases in market interest rates and a shift in earning asset mix. Total average securities were 41% of earning assets compared to 32%.\nTotal interest expense and average interest bearing liability changes for 2021 compared to 2020 were:\n\u2022Total interest expense decreased $16.7 million or 37% to $28.2 million compared to $44.9 million.\n\u2022The average rate paid on HTLF's interest bearing liabilities decreased to 0.28% compared to 0.54%, which was primarily due to recent decreases in market interest rates.\n\u2022Average interest bearing deposits increased $1.64 billion or 21% to $9.45 billion from $7.81 billion, which was primarily attributable to recent acquisitions and deposit growth.\n\u2022The average rate paid on HTLF's interest bearing deposits decreased 23 basis points to 0.16% compared to 0.39%, which was primarily attributable to recent decreases in market interest rates.\n\u2022Average borrowings decreased $17.3 million or 3% to $520.9 million from $538.2 million. The average interest rate paid on HTLF's borrowings was 2.57% compared to 2.71%.\nNet interest income changes for 2021 compared to 2020 were:\n\u2022Net interest income totaled $560.6 million compared to $491.7 million, which was an increase of $68.8 million or 14%.\n\u2022Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis (non-GAAP) totaled $567.8 million compared to $497.2 million, which was an increase of $70.6 million or 14%.\nTotal interest income and average earning asset changes for 2020 compared to 2019 were:\n\u2022Total interest income increased $22.3 million or 4% to $536.6 million from $514.3 million due to an increase in average earning assets, which was partially offset by a decrease in the average rate on earning assets.\n\u2022Total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis (non-GAAP) was $542.1 million compared to $519.3 million, which was an increase of $22.8 million or 4%.\n\u2022Average earning assets increased $2.64 billion or 24% to $13.48 billion from $10.85 billion, which was primarily attributable to recent acquisitions, increases in securities and loan growth, including PPP loans.\n\u2022The average rate on earning assets decreased 77 basis points to 4.02% compared to 4.79%, which was primarily due to recent decreases in market interest rates and the lower yield on PPP loans, which was 3.25%.\nTotal interest expense and average interest bearing liability changes for 2020 compared to 2019 were:\n\u2022Total interest expense decreased $35.7 million or 44% during 2020 to $44.9 million from $80.6 million during 2019.\n\u2022The average rate paid on HTLF's interest bearing liabilities decreased to 0.54% compared to 1.14%, which was primarily due to recent decreases in market interest rates.\n\u2022Average interest bearing deposits increased $1.16 billion or 17% to $7.81 billion from $6.65 billion, which was primarily attributable to recent acquisitions and deposit growth, including deposits from government stimulus payments and other COVID-19 relief programs.\n\u2022The average rate paid on HTLF's interest bearing deposits decreased 57 basis points to 0.39% compared to 0.96%, which was primarily attributable to recent decreases in market interest rates.\n\u2022Average borrowings increased $135.9 million or 34% to $538.2 million from $402.3 million. The average interest rate paid on HTLF's borrowings was 2.71% compared to 4.19%.\nNet interest income changes for 2020 compared to 2019 were:\n\u2022Net interest income totaled $491.7 million compared to $433.7 million, which was an increase of $58.0 million or 13%.\n\u2022Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis (non-GAAP) totaled $497.2 million compared to $438.7 million, which was an increase of $58.5 million or 13%.\nManagement believes net interest margin in dollars will continue to increase as the amount of earning assets grows, however the current low interest rate environment may result in a decrease to the net interest margin as a percentage of average earning assets. The Federal Reserve has indicated it will closely assess economic data, but has signaled it will begin to raise the Federal funds interest rate in early 2022. Ultimately,the timing and magnitude of any such changes are uncertain and will depend on domestic and global economic conditions. Any increase to the Federal Funds rate in 2022 would positively impact HTLF's net interest income due to its asset sensitive balance sheet.\nWe attempt to manage our balance sheet to minimize the effect that a change in interest rates has on our net interest margin. We plan to continue to work toward improving both our earning assets and funding mix through targeted organic growth strategies, which we believe will result in additional net interest income. We believe our net interest income simulations reflect a well-balanced and manageable interest rate posture.", "summary": "The report summarizes the financial condition and results of operations of HTLF, a multi-bank holding company, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of HTLF as of the dates and for the periods indicated is presented below. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial data appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HTLF and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned.\nFor a discussion of 2019 results of operations, including a discussion of the financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, refer to Part I, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Among other things, the estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Refer to Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" for further discussion on HTLF's critical accounting policies.\nThe estimates and judgments that management believes have the most effect on HTLF's reported financial position and results of operations are as follows:\nAllowance For Credit Losses\nThe process utilized by HTLF to estimate the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate for HTLF. The allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of identified and unidentified current expected credit losses in the existing loan portfolio. Therefore, the accuracy of this estimate could have a material impact on HTLF's earnings.\nFor certain commercial and agricultural loans and any related unfunded loan commitments, the expected credit losses are calculated on a pool basis through a transition matrix model derived life of loan probability of default and loss given default methodology. The probability of default and loss given default methodology have been developed using HTLF's historical loss experience over the look back period, currently over the most recent 13 years. For smaller commercial and agricultural loans, residential real estate loans and consumer loans and any related unfunded loan commitments, a lifetime average historical loss rate is established for each pool of loans based upon an average loss rate calculated using HTLF historical loss experience over the look back-period. The loss rates used in the allowance calculation are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted to reflect changes in historical loss levels or other risks.\nIf a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with other loans in the pool, it is evaluated on an individual basis and is not included in the collective evaluation. All individually assessed loan calculations are completed at least semi-annually.\nHTLF's allowance methodology also has a qualitative component, the purpose of which is to provide management with a means to take into consideration changes in current conditions that could potentially have an effect, up or down, on the level of recognized loan losses, that, for whatever reason, may not be represented in the quantitative analysis performed in determining its base loan loss rates.\nAdditionally, our allowance calculation utilizes an overlay approach for its economic forecasting component, similar to the method utilized for the qualitative factors. The length of the reasonable and supportable forecast period is a judgmental determination based on the level to which HTLF can reasonably support its forecast of economic conditions that drive its estimate of expected loss.\nThe economic indices utilized from the economic forecast include the national unemployment rate, national gross domestic product, capacity index manufacturing growth, national commercial real estate price index, national home price index and the national farm products price index. The economic indices utilized in the calculation which may be the most sensitive in the allowance calculation are the national unemployment rate and the national gross domestic product because management believes changes in these indices, positive or negative, will be impactful to all loan pools.\nThe appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is monitored on an ongoing basis by the credit administration group, loan review staff, executive and senior management and the boards of directors of HTLF and each Bank. There can be no assurances that the allowance for credit losses will be adequate to cover all current expected credit losses, but management believes that the allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 2021. While management uses available information to provide for credit losses, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of the loan portfolio and the need for future additions to the allowance will be based on changes in economic conditions.\nShould the economic climate deteriorate, borrowers may experience financial difficulty, and the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs, and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the provision for credit losses. Conversely, improvement in credit quality and economic conditions may allow for a reduction of provision for credit losses. Any unanticipated changes, positive or negative, could have a significant impact on the results of operations.\nIn addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for credit losses carried by the Banks. Such agencies may require us to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations.\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill and Core Deposit Intangibles\nWe record all assets and liabilities purchased in an acquisition, including intangibles, at fair value. Determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired often involves estimates based on third-party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include the use of estimates. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized but are subject to, at a minimum, annual tests for impairment. In certain situations, interim impairment tests may be required if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Core deposit intangibles assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using straight-line and accelerated methods and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount.\nThe initial fair value measurement of loans and core deposit intangibles require us to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future using valuation methods. The fair value of acquired loans is based on a discounted cash flow methodology that projects principal and interest payments using key assumptions related to the discount rate and loss rates. The fair value of core deposit intangibles is based on the cost savings approach under a discounted cash flow methodology, whereby projected net cash flow benefits are derived from estimating costs to carry deposits compared to alternative funding costs, and includes key assumptions related to the discount rate, deposit attrition rates and net costs, including discounted cash flow analyses. Events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include, among others, competitive forces, customer behaviors, changes in revenue growth trends, cost structures, technology, changes in discount rates and market conditions. In determining the reasonableness of cash flow estimates, HTLF reviews historical performance of the underlying assets or similar assets in an effort to assess and validate assumptions utilized in its estimates.\nOVERVIEW\nHTLF is a multi-bank holding company providing banking, mortgage, wealth management, investments and insurance services to businesses and consumers. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, HTLF has eleven separately chartered banking subsidiaries with 129 locations in Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Arizona, Montana, Colorado, Minnesota, Kansas, Missouri, Texas and California.

Subsequent to the systems conversion, seven of AimBank's twenty-five bank branches were transferred to HTLF's New Mexico Bank & Trust subsidiary.\nBranding Change\nOn April 14, 2021, a branding change from Heartland Financial to HTLF was announced and rolled out across the organization. The branding was refreshed to better reflect the financial and non-financial strengths of HTLF, including a diverse footprint and the continued growth of the company.\nPaycheck Protection Program Loans\nHTLF originated a second round of Paycheck Protection Program loans (\"PPP II\") totaling $473.9 million since the beginning of 2021. PPP II loans are 100% United States SBA guaranteed, and borrowers may be eligible to have an amount up to the entire principal balance forgiven and paid by the SBA. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 98% of PPP loans originated in 2020 (\"PPP I\") loans have been forgiven, and approximately 63% of PPP II loans have been forgiven.\nTotal interest income on PPP loans increased $15.3 million or 61% to $40.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIssuance of Subordinated Debt\nOn September 8, 2021, HTLF closed its public offering of $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.75% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2031 (the \"2021 subordinated notes\"). The 2021 subordinated notes were issued at par with an underwriting discount of $1.9 million, and the net proceeds totaled $147.6 million. The 2021 subordinated notes were registered under HTLF's effective shelf registration statement and qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. The net proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes, which includes, without limitation, providing capital to support HTLF's organic growth or growth through strategic acquisitions, financing investments, capital expenditures, investments in the subsidiary banks as regulatory capital, and repaying indebtedness. The 2021 subordinated notes have a fixed interest rate of 2.75% until September 15, 2026, at which time the interest rate will be reset quarterly to a benchmark interest rate, which is expected to be three-month term Secure Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") plus a spread of 210 basis points. The 2021 subordinated notes mature on September 15, 2031, and become redeemable at HTLF's option on September 15, 2026.\nBranch Optimization\nDuring 2021, HTLF consolidated eight legacy bank branches, which included two branches in Midwestern markets, four branches in Southwestern markets, and five branches in Western markets, and sold one branch in a Midwestern market as it continues to respond to customer preferences and closely manage expenses. HTLF plans to reduce branch locations by approximately 10% in 2022 through closures, consolidations or sales. HTLF continues to review its branch network for optimization and consolidation opportunities, which may result in additional write-downs of fixed assets in future periods.\nCommon Stock Dividend Increase\nSince 2020, the common stock dividend has been increased from $0.20 per common share in each quarter of 2020 to $0.22 for the first and second quarters of 2021, $0.25 for the third quarter of 2021, and $0.27 per common share in fourth quarter of 2021.\nCharter Consolidation\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, HTLF completed evaluating the consolidation of its eleven bank charters as part of its ongoing efforts to improve operational efficiency. As a result, the HTLF Board of Directors approved a plan to consolidate its eleven bank charters into a single Colorado based charter, \"HTLF Bank,\" that will continue to operate under separate bank brands in each market. The plan is subject to regulatory approval.\nThe consolidation project is underway and is expected to be completed by the end of 2023. The first bank consolidation is expected to occur in mid-2022. The estimated restructuring costs of the project are approximately $20.0 million, of which $1.9 million was incurred in 2021. The ongoing financial benefits from consolidation are expected to be approximately $20.0 million annually when the project is completed and are expected to arise from the elimination of redundancies and improved operating processes. The consolidation will also increase operating capacity to be leveraged with future growth and provide better alignment of our products and services.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Update\nIn March 2020, the outbreak of the novel COVID-19 was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The spread of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity in the United States and globally in 2021 and 2020.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, HTLF implemented and continues to operate under its pandemic management plan to assure workplace and employee safety and business resiliency, and the pandemic management plan continues to evolve in response to the recent developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HTLF's financial condition and results of operations will depend on the severity and duration of the pandemic, including the emergence of COVID-19 variants, related restrictions on business and consumer activity, efficacy and distribution of vaccines and the availability of government programs to alleviate the economic stress of the pandemic. See \"COVID-19 Pandemic Risks\" in Part 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2020 Developments\nAdoption of ASU 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)\"\nOn January 1, 2020, HTLF adopted ASU 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),\" commonly referred to as \"CECL.\" The impact of HTLF's adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020 (\"Day 1\") resulted in the following:\n\u2022an increase of $12.1 million to the allowance for credit losses related to loans, which included a reclassification of $6.0 million of purchased credit impaired loan discount on previously acquired loans, and a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings totaling $4.6 million, net of taxes of $1.5 million;\n\u2022an increase of $13.6 million to the allowance for unfunded commitments and a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings totaling $10.2 million, net of taxes of $3.4 million, and\n\u2022established an allowance for credit losses for HTLF's held to maturity debt securities of $158,000 and a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings totaling $118,000, net of taxes of $40,000.\nThe allowance calculation under CECL is an expected loss model, which encompasses expected losses over the life of the loan and held to maturity securities portfolios, including expected losses due to changes in economic conditions and forecasts, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information, see Note 1, \"Basis of Presentation\" and Note 6, \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" to the consolidated financial statements contained herein.\nIssued $115.0 Million of Preferred Equity\nOn June 26, 2020, HTLF issued and sold 4.6 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/400th interest in a share of 7.00% Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series E. The depositary shares are listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \"HTLFP.\" The net proceeds of $110.7 million are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include organic and acquired growth, financing investments, capital expenditures, investments in wholly-owned subsidiaries as regulatory capital and repayment of debt.\nBranch Optimization\nIn the second half of 2020, HTLF's member banks approved plans to consolidate eight branch locations, which included two branches in the Midwest region, five branches in the Western region and one in the Southwestern region and resulted in $1.2 million and $2.3 million of fixed asset write-downs in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively. The branch consolidations were completed in early 2021.\nJohnson Bank Arizona Operations Purchase and Assumption\nOn December 4, 2020, Arizona Bank & Trust (\"AB&T\"), HTLF's wholly-owned subsidiary headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, acquired certain assets and assumed substantially all of the deposits and certain other liabilities of Johnson Bank's Arizona operations, which included four branches. Johnson Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson Financial Group, Inc. headquartered in Racine, Wisconsin. As of the closing date, AB&T acquired, at fair value, total assets of $419.7 million, which included gross loans of $150.7 million, and deposits of $415.5 million. The systems conversion occurred simultaneously with the closing of the transaction.\nAimBank Acquisition\nOn December 4, 2020, HTLF completed the acquisition of AimBank, headquartered in Levelland, Texas. Based on HTLF's closing common stock price of $41.89 on December 4, 2020, the aggregate consideration paid to AimBank common shareholders was $264.5 million, which was paid by delivery of common stock of $217.2 million and cash of $47.3 million, subject to certain hold-back provisions of the merger agreement relating to the cash consideration. AimBank was merged with and into HTLF's wholly-owned Texas subsidiary, First Bank and Trust, and the combined entity operates as First Bank and Trust. As of the closing date, AimBank had, at fair value, total assets of $1.97 billion, which included gross loans of $1.09 billion, and deposits of $1.67 billion. The systems conversion for this transaction occurred in February 2021.\n\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Subsequent to the systems conversion, seven of AimBank's twenty-five bank branches were transferred to HTLF's New Mexico Bank & Trust subsidiary.\nBranding Change\nOn April 14, 2021, a branding change from Heartland Financial to HTLF was announced and rolled out across the organization. The branding was refreshed to better reflect the financial and non-financial strengths of HTLF, including a diverse footprint and the continued growth of the company.\nPaycheck Protection Program Loans\nHTLF originated a second round of Paycheck Protection Program loans (\"PPP II\") totaling $473.9 million since the beginning of 2021. PPP II loans are 100% United States SBA guaranteed, and borrowers may be eligible to have an amount up to the entire principal balance forgiven and paid by the SBA. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 98% of PPP loans originated in 2020 (\"PPP I\") loans have been forgiven, and approximately 63% of PPP II loans have been forgiven.\nTotal interest income on PPP loans increased $15.3 million or 61% to $40.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIssuance of Subordinated Debt\nOn September 8, 2021, HTLF closed its public offering of $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.75% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2031 (the \"2021 subordinated notes\"). The 2021 subordinated notes were issued at par with an underwriting discount of $1.9 million, and the net proceeds totaled $147.6 million. The 2021 subordinated notes were registered under HTLF's effective shelf registration statement and qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. The net proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes, which includes, without limitation, providing capital to support HTLF's organic growth or growth through strategic acquisitions, financing investments, capital expenditures, investments in the subsidiary banks as regulatory capital, and repaying indebtedness. The 2021 subordinated notes have a fixed interest rate of 2.75% until September 15, 2026, at which time the interest rate will be reset quarterly to a benchmark interest rate, which is expected to be three-month term Secure Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") plus a spread of 210 basis points. The 2021 subordinated notes mature on September 15, 2031, and become redeemable at HTLF's option on September 15, 2026.\nBranch Optimization\nDuring 2021, HTLF consolidated eight legacy bank branches, which included two branches in Midwestern markets, four branches in Southwestern markets, and five branches in Western markets, and sold one branch in a Midwestern market as it continues to respond to customer preferences and closely manage expenses. HTLF plans to reduce branch locations by approximately 10% in 2022 through closures, consolidations or sales. HTLF continues to review its branch network for optimization and consolidation opportunities, which may result in additional write-downs of fixed assets in future periods.\nCommon Stock Dividend Increase\nSince 2020, the common stock dividend has been increased from $0.20 per common share in each quarter of 2020 to $0.22 for the first and second quarters of 2021, $0.25 for the third quarter of 2021, and $0.27 per common share in fourth quarter of 2021.\nCharter Consolidation\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, HTLF completed evaluating the consolidation of its eleven bank charters as part of its ongoing efforts to improve operational efficiency. As a result, the HTLF Board of Directors approved a plan to consolidate its eleven bank charters into a single Colorado based charter, \"HTLF Bank,\" that will continue to operate under separate bank brands in each market. The plan is subject to regulatory approval.\nThe consolidation project is underway and is expected to be completed by the end of 2023. The first bank consolidation is expected to occur in mid-2022. The estimated restructuring costs of the project are approximately $20.0 million, of which $1.9 million was incurred in 2021. The ongoing financial benefits from consolidation are expected to be approximately $20.0 million annually when the project is completed and are expected to arise from the elimination of redundancies and improved operating processes. The consolidation will also increase operating capacity to be leveraged with future growth and provide better alignment of our products and services.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Update\nIn March 2020, the outbreak of the novel COVID-19 was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The spread of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity in the United States and globally in 2021 and 2020.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, HTLF implemented and continues to operate under its pandemic management plan to assure workplace and employee safety and business resiliency, and the pandemic management plan continues to evolve in response to the recent developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HTLF's financial condition and results of operations will depend on the severity and duration of the pandemic, including the emergence of COVID-19 variants, related restrictions on business and consumer activity, efficacy and distribution of vaccines and the availability of government programs to alleviate the economic stress of the pandemic. See \"COVID-19 Pandemic Risks\" in Part 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2020 Developments\nAdoption of ASU 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)\"\nOn January 1, 2020, HTLF adopted ASU 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),\" commonly referred to as \"CECL.\" The impact of HTLF's adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020 (\"Day 1\") resulted in the following:\n\u2022an increase of $12.1 million to the allowance for credit losses related to loans, which included a reclassification of $6.0 million of purchased credit impaired loan discount on previously acquired loans, and a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings totaling $4.6 million, net of taxes of $1.5 million;\n\u2022an increase of $13.6 million to the allowance for unfunded commitments and a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings totaling $10.2 million, net of taxes of $3.4 million, and\n\u2022established an allowance for credit losses for HTLF's held to maturity debt securities of $158,000 and a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings totaling $118,000, net of taxes of $40,000.\nThe allowance calculation under CECL is an expected loss model, which encompasses expected losses over the life of the loan and held to maturity securities portfolios, including expected losses due to changes in economic conditions and forecasts, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information, see Note 1, \"Basis of Presentation\" and Note 6, \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" to the consolidated financial statements contained herein.\nIssued $115.0 Million of Preferred Equity\nOn June 26, 2020, HTLF issued and sold 4.6 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/400th interest in a share of 7.00% Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series E. The depositary shares are listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \"HTLFP.\" The net proceeds of $110.7 million are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include organic and acquired growth, financing investments, capital expenditures, investments in wholly-owned subsidiaries as regulatory capital and repayment of debt.\nBranch Optimization\nIn the second half of 2020, HTLF's member banks approved plans to consolidate eight branch locations, which included two branches in the Midwest region, five branches in the Western region and one in the Southwestern region and resulted in $1.2 million and $2.3 million of fixed asset write-downs in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively. The branch consolidations were completed in early 2021.\nJohnson Bank Arizona Operations Purchase and Assumption\nOn December 4, 2020, Arizona Bank & Trust (\"AB&T\"), HTLF's wholly-owned subsidiary headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, acquired certain assets and assumed substantially all of the deposits and certain other liabilities of Johnson Bank's Arizona operations, which included four branches. Johnson Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson Financial Group, Inc. headquartered in Racine, Wisconsin. As of the closing date, AB&T acquired, at fair value, total assets of $419.7 million, which included gross loans of $150.7 million, and deposits of $415.5 million. The systems conversion occurred simultaneously with the closing of the transaction.\nAimBank Acquisition\nOn December 4, 2020, HTLF completed the acquisition of AimBank, headquartered in Levelland, Texas. Based on HTLF's closing common stock price of $41.89 on December 4, 2020, the aggregate consideration paid to AimBank common shareholders was $264.5 million, which was paid by delivery of common stock of $217.2 million and cash of $47.3 million, subject to certain hold-back provisions of the merger agreement relating to the cash consideration. AimBank was merged with and into HTLF's wholly-owned Texas subsidiary, First Bank and Trust, and the combined entity operates as First Bank and Trust. As of the closing date, AimBank had, at fair value, total assets of $1.97 billion, which included gross loans of $1.09 billion, and deposits of $1.67 billion. The systems conversion for this transaction occurred in February 2021.\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
