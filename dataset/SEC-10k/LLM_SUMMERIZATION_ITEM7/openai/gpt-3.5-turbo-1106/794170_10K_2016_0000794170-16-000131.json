MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ( MD&A\u201d)\nThis discussion and analysis is based on, should be read together with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 15(a)1 of this Form 10-K, beginning at page. It also should be read in conjunction with the disclosure under Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in Part 1 of this Form 10-K.\nWhen this report uses the words we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d and the Company,\u201d they refer to Toll Brothers, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. References herein to fiscal year refer to our fiscal years ended or ending October 31.\nUnless otherwise stated in this report, net contracts signed represents a number or value equal to the gross number or value of contracts signed during the relevant period, less the number or value of contracts canceled during the relevant period, which includes contracts that were signed during the relevant period and in prior periods. Backlog consists of homes under contract but not yet delivered to our home buyers ( backlog\u201d).\nOVERVIEW\nOur Business\nWe design, build, market, sell, and arrange financing for detached and attached homes in luxury residential communities. We cater to move-up, empty-nester, active-adult, age-qualified, and second-home buyers in the United States ( Traditional Home Building Product\u201d). We also build and sell homes in urban infill markets through Toll Brothers City Living\u00ae ( City Living\u201d). At October 31, 2016, we were operating in 19 states. In the five years ended October 31, 2016, we delivered 24,490 homes from 621 communities, including 6,098 homes from 377 communities in fiscal 2016.\nIn February 2014, we acquired the home building business of Shapell Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Shapell\u201d), and in November 2016, we acquired substantially all of the assets and operations of Coleman Real Estate Holdings, LLC ( Coleman\u201d). See Acquisitions\u201d below for more information.\nWe are developing several land parcels for master planned communities in which we intend to build homes on a portion of the lots and sell the remaining lots to other builders. Two of these master planned communities are being developed 100% by us, and the remaining communities are being developed through joint ventures with other builders or financial partners.\nIn addition to our residential for-sale business, we also develop and operate for-rent apartments through joint ventures. See the section entitled Toll Brothers Apartment Living/Toll Brothers Campus Living/Toll Brothers Realty Trust\u201d below.\nWe operate our own land development, architectural, engineering, mortgage, title, landscaping, security monitoring, lumber distribution, house component assembly, and manufacturing operations. In addition, in certain markets, we develop land for sale to other builders, often through joint venture structures with other builders or with financial partners. We also develop, own, and operate golf courses and country clubs, which generally are associated with several of our master planned communities.\nWe have investments in various unconsolidated entities. We have investments in joint ventures (i) to develop land for the joint venture participants and for sale to outside builders ( Land Development Joint Ventures\u201d); (ii) to develop for-sale homes ( Home Building Joint Ventures\u201d); (iii) to develop luxury for-rent residential apartments, commercial space and a hotel ( Rental Property Joint Ventures\u201d); and (iv) to invest in distressed loans and real estate and provide financing for residential builders and developers for the acquisition and development of land and home sites ( Gibraltar Joint Ventures\u201d).\nFinancial Highlights\nIn fiscal 2016, we recognized $5.17 billion of revenues and net income of $382.1 million, as compared to $4.17 billion of revenues and net income of $363.2 million in fiscal 2015.\nIn fiscal 2016 and 2015, the value of net contracts signed was $5.65 billion (6,719 homes) and $4.96 billion (5,910 homes), respectively. The value of our backlog at October 31, 2016 was $3.98 billion (4,685 homes), as compared to our backlog at October 31, 2015 of $3.50 billion (4,064 homes).\nAt October 31, 2016, we had $633.7 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and approximately $961.8 million for borrowing available under our $1.295 billion revolving credit facility ( New Credit Facility\u201d) that matures in May 2021. At October 31, 2016, we had $250.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the New Credit Facility and had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $83.2 million.\nAt October 31, 2016, our total equity and our debt to total capitalization ratio were $4.24 billion and 0.47 to 1:00, respectively,\nAcquisitions\nShapell Industries, Inc.\nOn February 4, 2014, we completed our acquisition of Shapell pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) dated November 6, 2013 with Shapell Investment Properties, Inc. ( SIPI\u201d). We acquired all of the equity interests in Shapell from SIPI on February 4, 2014 for $1.49 billion, net of cash acquired (the Acquisition\u201d). We acquired the single-family residential real property development business of Shapell, including a portfolio of approximately 4,950 home sites in California, some of which we have sold to other builders. The Acquisition provided us with a premier California land portfolio including 11 active selling communities, as of the Acquisition date, in affluent, high-growth markets: the San Francisco Bay area, metro Los Angeles, Orange County, and the Carlsbad market. As part of the Acquisition, we assumed contracts to deliver 126 homes with an aggregate value of approximately $105.3 million. The Shapell operations have been fully integrated into our operations.\nColeman Real Estate Holdings, LLC\nIn October 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets and operations of Coleman. In November 2016, we completed the acquisition of Coleman for approximately $85.2 million in cash. The assets acquired were primarily inventory, including approximately 1,750 home sites owned or controlled through land purchase agreements. As part of the acquisition, we assumed contracts to deliver 128 homes with an aggregate value of $38.8 million. The average price of the undelivered homes at the date of acquisition was approximately $303,000. Our selling community count increased by 15 communities at the acquisition date.\nSee Note 2, Acquisitions,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these acquisitions.\nOur Business Environment and Current Outlook\nSince the third quarter of fiscal 2014 through the end of fiscal 2016, we saw a general strengthening in customer demand. In fiscal 2016, we signed 6,719 contracts with an aggregate value of $5.65 billion, compared to 5,910 contracts with an aggregate value of $4.96 billion in fiscal 2015, and 5,271 contracts with an aggregate value of $3.90 billion in fiscal 2014. We are optimistic that the strengthening in customer demand will continue for the foreseeable future. We believe that, as the national economy continues to improve and as the millennial generation comes of age, pent-up demand for homes will continue to be released.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau ( Census Bureau\u201d), the number of households earning $100,000 or more (in constant 2015 dollars) at September 2016 stood at 33.2 million, or approximately 26.4% of all U.S. households. This group has grown at three times the rate of increase of all U.S. households since 1980. According to Harvard University's 2016 report, The State of the Nation's Housing,\u201d demographic forces are likely to drive the addition of just under 1.3 million new households per year during the next decade.\nHousing starts, which encompass the units needed for household formations, second homes, and the replacement of obsolete or demolished units, have not kept pace with this projected household growth. According to the Census Bureau's October 2016 New Residential Sales Report, new home inventory stands at a supply of just 5.2 months, based on current sales paces. If demand and pace increase significantly, the supply of 5.2 months could quickly be drawn down. During the period 1970 through 2007, total housing starts in the United States averaged approximately 1.6 million per year, while during the period 2008 through 2015, total housing starts averaged approximately 0.81 million per year according to the Census Bureau.\nWe continue to believe that many of our communities are in desirable locations that are difficult to replace and in markets where approvals have been increasingly difficult to achieve. We believe that many of these communities have substantial embedded value that may be realized in the future as the housing recovery strengthens.\nCompetitive Landscape\nThe home building business is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with numerous home builders of varying sizes, ranging from local to national in scope, some of which have greater sales and financial resources than we do. Sales of existing homes, whether by a homeowner or by a financial institution that has acquired a home through a foreclosure, also provide competition. We compete primarily on the basis of price, location, design, quality, service, and reputation. We believe our financial stability, relative to many others in our industry, is a favorable competitive factor as more home buyers focus on builder solvency.\nIn addition, there are fewer and more selective lenders serving our industry as compared to prior years and we believe that these lenders gravitate to the home building companies that offer them the greatest security, the strongest balance sheets, and the broadest array of potential business opportunities.\nLand Acquisition and Development\nOur business is subject to many risks, because of the extended length of time that it takes to obtain the necessary approvals on a property, complete the land improvements on it, and deliver a home after a home buyer signs an agreement of sale. In certain cases, we attempt to reduce some of these risks by utilizing one or more of the following methods: controlling land for future development through options (also referred to herein as land purchase contracts\u201d or option and purchase agreements\u201d), which enable us to obtain necessary governmental approvals before acquiring title to the land; generally commencing construction of a detached home only after executing an agreement of sale and receiving a substantial down payment from the buyer; and using subcontractors to perform home construction and land development work on a fixed-price basis.\nDuring fiscal 2016 and 2015, we acquired control of approximately 10,682 home sites (net of options terminated and home sites sold) and, approximately 2,611 home sites (net of options terminated and home sites sold), respectively. At October 31, 2016, we controlled approximately 48,837 home sites, as compared to approximately 44,253 home sites at October 31, 2015, and 47,167 home sites at October 31, 2014. In addition, at October 31, 2016, we expect to purchase approximately 3,600 additional home sites from several land development joint ventures in which we have an interest, at prices not yet determined.\nOf the approximately 48,837 total home sites that we owned or controlled through options at October 31, 2016, we owned approximately 34,137 and controlled approximately 14,700 through options. Of the 48,837 home sites, approximately 17,065 were substantially improved. The 14,700 home sites controlled through options includes the 1,750 home sites owned or controlled by Coleman.\nIn addition, at October 31, 2016, our Land Development Joint Ventures owned approximately 11,400 home sites (including 240 home sites included in the 14,700 controlled through options), and our Homebuilding Joint Ventures owned approximately 400 home sites.\nAt October 31, 2016, we were selling from 310 communities, compared to 288 communities at October 31, 2015, and 263 communities at October 31, 2014.\nCustomer Mortgage Financing\nWe maintain relationships with a widely diversified group of mortgage financial institutions, many of which are among the largest in the industry. We believe that regional and community banks continue to recognize the long-term value in creating relationships with high-quality, affluent customers such as our home buyers, and these banks continue to provide such customers with financing.\nWe believe that our home buyers generally are, and should continue to be, better able to secure mortgages due to their typically lower loan-to-value ratios and attractive credit profiles, as compared to the average home buyer.\nToll Brothers Apartment Living/Toll Brothers Campus Living/Toll Brothers Realty Trust\nIn addition to our residential for-sale business, we also develop and operate for-rent apartments through joint ventures. At October 31, 2016, we controlled 28 land parcels as for-rent apartment projects containing approximately 9,600 units. These projects, which are located in the metro Boston to metro Washington, D.C. corridor; Atlanta, Georgia; Dallas, Texas; and Fremont, California are being operated, are being developed or will be developed with partners under the brand names Toll Brothers Apartment Living, Toll Brothers Campus Living and Toll Brothers Realty Trust (the Trust\u201d).\nAt October 31, 2016, we had approximately 2,950 units in for-rent apartment projects that were occupied or ready for occupancy, 600 units in the lease-up stage, 900 units under active development, and 5,150 units in the planning stage. Of the 9,600 units at October 31, 2016, 4,850 were owned by joint ventures in which we have an interest; approximately 1,600 were owned by us; 2,850 were under contract to be purchased by us; and 300 were under a letter of intent.\nCONTRACTS AND BACKLOG\nThe aggregate value of net sales contracts signed increased 14.0% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, and 27.2% in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. The value of net sales contracts signed was $5.65 billion (6,719 homes) in fiscal 2016, $4.96 billion (5,910 homes) in fiscal 2015, and $3.90 billion (5,271 homes) in fiscal 2014.\nThe increase in the aggregate value of net contracts signed in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was the result of a 13.7% increase in the number of net contracts signed. The increase in the number of net contracts signed in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was primarily due to the continued recovery in the U.S. housing market in fiscal 2016.\nThe value of our backlog at October 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $3.98 billion (4,685 homes), $3.50 billion (4,064 homes), and $2.72 billion (3,679 homes), respectively. Approximately 97% of the homes in backlog at October 31, 2016 are expected to be delivered by October 31, 2017. The 13.7% increase in the value of homes in backlog at October 31, 2016, as compared to October 31, 2015, was primarily due to a 14.0% increase in the value of net contracts signed in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, and the higher backlog at the beginning of fiscal 2016, as compared to the beginning of fiscal 2015, offset, in part, by a 23.9% increase in the aggregate value of our deliveries in fiscal 2016, as compared to the aggregate value of deliveries in fiscal 2015.\nThe 28.8% increase in the value of homes in backlog at October 31, 2015, as compared to October 31, 2014, was due to a 27.2% increase in the value of net contracts signed in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, and the higher backlog at the beginning of fiscal 2015, as compared to the beginning of fiscal 2014, offset, in part, by a 6.6% increase in the aggregate value of our deliveries in fiscal 2015, as compared to the aggregate value of deliveries in fiscal 2014.\nFor more information regarding revenues, net contracts signed, and backlog by geographic segment, see Segments\u201d in this MD&A.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nInventory\nInventory is stated at cost unless an impairment exists, in which case it is written down to fair value in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). In addition to direct land acquisition, land development, and home construction costs, costs also include interest, real estate taxes, and direct overhead related to development and construction, which are capitalized to inventory during periods beginning with the commencement of development and ending with the completion of construction. For those communities that have been temporarily closed, no additional capitalized interest is allocated to the community's inventory until it reopens, and other carrying costs are expensed as incurred. Once a parcel of land has been approved for development and we open the community, it can typically take four or more years to fully develop, sell, and deliver all the homes in that community. Longer or shorter time periods are possible depending on the number of home sites in a community and the sales and delivery pace of the homes in a community. Our master planned communities, consisting of several smaller communities, may take up to 10 years or more to complete. Because our inventory is considered a long-lived asset under GAAP, we are required to regularly review the carrying value of each of our communities and write down the value of those communities when we believe the values are not recoverable.\nOperating Communities: When the profitability of an operating community deteriorates, the sales pace declines significantly, or some other factor indicates a possible impairment in the recoverability of the asset, the asset is reviewed for impairment by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flow for the community to its carrying value. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flow is less than the community's carrying value, the carrying value is written down to its estimated fair value. Estimated fair value is primarily determined by discounting the estimated future cash flow of each community. The impairment is charged to cost of revenues in the period in which the impairment is determined. In estimating the future undiscounted cash flow of a community, we use various estimates such as (i) the expected sales pace in a community, based upon general economic conditions that will have a short-term or long-term impact on the market in which the community is located and on competition within the market, including the number of home sites available and pricing and incentives being offered in other communities owned by us or by other builders; (ii) the expected sales prices and sales incentives to be offered in a community; (iii) costs expended to date and expected to be incurred in the future, including, but not limited to, land and land development costs, home construction, interest, and overhead costs; (iv) alternative product offerings that may be offered in a community that will have an impact on sales pace, sales price, building cost, or the number of homes that can be built in a particular community; and (v) alternative uses for the property, such as the possibility of a sale of the entire community to another builder or the sale of individual home sites.\nFuture Communities: We evaluate all land held for future communities or future sections of operating communities, whether owned or optioned, to determine whether or not we expect to proceed with the development of the land as originally contemplated. This evaluation encompasses the same types of estimates used for operating communities described above, as well as an evaluation of the regulatory environment in which the land is located and the estimated probability of obtaining the necessary approvals, the estimated time and cost it will take to obtain those approvals, and the possible concessions that will be required to be given in order to obtain them. Concessions may include cash payments to fund improvements to public places such as parks and streets, dedication of a portion of the property for use by the public or as open space, or a reduction in the density or size of the homes to be built. Based upon this review, we decide (i) as to land under contract to be purchased, whether the contract will likely be terminated or renegotiated, and (ii) as to land we own, whether the land will likely be\ndeveloped as contemplated or in an alternative manner, or should be sold. We then further determine whether costs that have been capitalized to the community are recoverable or should be written off. The write-off is charged to cost of revenues in the period in which the need for the write-off is determined.\nThe estimates used in the determination of the estimated cash flows and fair value of both current and future communities are based on factors known to us at the time such estimates are made and our expectations of future operations and economic conditions. Should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated fair value deteriorate in the future, we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges and write-offs related to current and future communities and such amounts could be material.\nWe provided for inventory impairment charges and the expensing of costs that we believed not to be recoverable in each of the three fiscal years ended October 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, as shown in the table below (amounts in thousands):\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

In accordance with GAAP, a valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such asset will not be realized. The realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law. We assess the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets\nbased on GAAP's more-likely-than-not\u201d realization threshold criteria. In our assessment, appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is significant negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, consistency, and magnitude of current and cumulative income and losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryback or carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards being used before expiration, and tax planning alternatives.\nOur assessment of the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets includes assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect our actual tax results, and our future business results may affect the amount of our deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of our deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events.\nDue to uncertainties in the estimation process, particularly with respect to changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods (carryforward period assumptions), actual results could differ from the estimates used in our analysis. Our assumptions require significant judgment because the residential home building industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. If our results of operations are less than projected and there is insufficient objectively verifiable positive evidence to support the more-likely-than-not realization of our deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance would be required to reduce or eliminate our deferred tax assets.\nOur deferred tax assets consist principally of the recognition of losses primarily driven by accrued expenses, inventory impairments, and impairments of investments in unconsolidated entities. In accordance with GAAP, we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on our determination of whether it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. At October 31, 2016 and 2015, we determined that it was more-likely-than-not that our deferred assets would be realized for federal purposes. Accordingly, at October 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not record any valuation allowances against our federal deferred tax assets.\nWe file tax returns in the various states in which we do business. Each state has its own statutes regarding the use of tax loss carryforwards. Some of the states in which we do business do not allow for the carryforward of losses, while others allow for carryforwards for five years to 20 years.\nFor state tax purposes, due to past and projected losses in certain jurisdictions where we do not have carryback potential and/or cannot sufficiently forecast future taxable income, we recognized net cumulative valuation allowances against our state deferred tax assets at October 31, 2016 and 2015. During fiscal 2015, and 2014, due to improved actual and/or operating results, we reversed $16.3 million and $13.3 million of state deferred tax asset valuation allowances, respectively. During fiscal 2016, no state deferred tax asset valuation allowances were reversed. In addition, we establish valuation allowances for newly created deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions where it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax asset would not be realized. During fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recognized new valuation allowances of $1.0 million, $3.7 million, and $1.3 million, respectively. The valuation allowance at October 31, 2016 of $32.2 million relates to deferred tax assets in states that had not met the more-likely-than-not realization threshold criteria.\nRevenue and Cost Recognition\nRevenues and cost of revenues from home sales are recorded at the time each home is delivered and title and possession are transferred to the buyer.\nFor our standard attached and detached homes, land, land development, and related costs, both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future, are amortized to the cost of homes closed based upon the total number of homes to be constructed in each community. Any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs subsequent to the commencement of delivery of homes are allocated to the remaining undelivered homes in the community. Home construction and related costs are charged to the cost of homes closed under the specific identification method. For our master planned communities, the estimated land, common area development, and related costs, including the cost of golf courses, net of their estimated residual value, are allocated to individual communities within a master planned community on a relative sales value basis. Any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs are allocated to the remaining home sites in each of the communities of the master planned community.\nFor high-rise/mid-rise projects, land, land development, construction, and related costs, both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future, are generally amortized to the cost of units closed based upon an estimated relative sales value of the units closed to the total estimated sales value. Any changes resulting from a change in the estimated total costs or revenues of the project are allocated to the remaining units to be delivered.\nForfeited customer deposits: Forfeited customer deposits are recognized in other income-net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income in the period in which we determine that the customer will not complete the purchase of the home and we have the right to retain the deposit.\nSales Incentives: In order to promote sales of our homes, we grant our home buyers sales incentives from time to time. These incentives will vary by type of incentive and by amount on a community-by-community and home-by-home basis. Incentives that impact the value of the home or the sales price paid, such as special or additional options, are generally reflected as a reduction in sales revenues. Incentives that we pay to an outside party, such as paying some or all of a home buyer's closing costs, are recorded as an additional cost of revenues. Incentives are recognized at the time the home is delivered to the home buyer and we receive the sales proceeds.\nWarranty and Self-Insurance\nWarranty: We provide all of our home buyers with a limited warranty as to workmanship and mechanical equipment. We also provide many of our home buyers with a limited 10-year warranty as to structural integrity. We accrue for expected warranty costs at the time each home is closed and title and possession are transferred to the home buyer. Warranty costs are accrued based upon historical experience. Adjustments to our warranty liabilities related to homes delivered in prior years are recorded in the period in which a change in our estimate occurs. Over the past several years, we have had a significant number of warranty claims related primarily to older homes built in Pennsylvania and Delaware. See Note 6 - Accrued Expenses\u201d in Item 15(a)1 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these warranty charges.\nSelf-Insurance: We maintain, and require the majority of our subcontractors to maintain, general liability insurance (including construction defect and bodily injury coverage) and workers' compensation insurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims related to our home building activities, subject to certain self-insured retentions, deductibles and other coverage limits ( self-insured liability\u201d). We also provide general liability insurance for our subcontractors in Arizona, California, Nevada, Washington, and certain areas of Texas, where eligible subcontractors are enrolled as insureds under our general liability insurance policies in each community in which they perform work. For those enrolled subcontractors, we absorb their general liability associated with the work performed on our homes within the applicable community as part of our overall general liability insurance and our self-insurance through our captive insurance subsidiary.\nWe record expenses and liabilities based on the estimated costs required to cover our self-insured liability and the estimated costs of potential claims and claim adjustment expenses that are above our coverage limits or that are not covered by our insurance policies. These estimated costs are based on an analysis of our historical claims and industry data, and include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported ( IBNR\u201d).\nWe engage a third-party actuary that uses our historical claim and expense data, input from our internal legal and risk management groups, as well as industry data, to estimate our liabilities related to unpaid claims, IBNR associated with the risks that we are assuming for our self-insured liability and other required costs to administer current and expected claims. These estimates are subject to uncertainty due to a variety of factors, the most significant being the long period of time between the delivery of a home to a home buyer and when a structural warranty or construction defect claim is made, and the ultimate resolution of the claim. Though state regulations vary, construction defect claims are reported and resolved over a prolonged period of time, which can extend for 10 years or longer. As a result, the majority of the estimated liability relates to IBNR. Adjustments to our liabilities related to homes delivered in prior years are recorded in the period in which a change in our estimate occurs.\nThe projection of losses related to these liabilities requires actuarial assumptions that are subject to variability due to uncertainties regarding construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of product we build, insurance industry practices and legal or regulatory actions and/or interpretations, among other factors. Key assumptions used in these estimates include claim frequencies, severities and settlement patterns, which can occur over an extended period of time. In addition, changes in the frequency and severity of reported claims and the estimates to settle claims can impact the trends and assumptions used in the actuarial analysis, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Due to the degree of judgment required, the potential for variability in these underlying assumptions, our actual future costs could differ from those estimated, and the difference could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe also operate through a number of joint ventures. These joint ventures (i) develop land for the joint venture participants and for sale to outside builders ( Land Development Joint Ventures\u201d); (ii) develop for-sale homes ( Home Building Joint Ventures\u201d); (iii) develop luxury for-rent residential apartments, commercial space and a hotel ( Rental Property Joint Ventures\u201d); and (iv) invest in distressed loans and real estate and provide financing for residential builders and developers for\nthe acquisition and development of land and home sites ( Gibraltar Joint Ventures\u201d). We earn construction and management fee income from many of these joint ventures.\nOur investments in these entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. We are a party to several joint ventures with unrelated parties to develop and sell land that is owned by the joint ventures. We recognize our proportionate share of the earnings from the sale of home sites to other builders, including our joint venture partners. We do not recognize earnings from the home sites we purchase from these ventures at the time of our purchase; instead, our cost basis in the home sites is reduced by our share of the earnings realized by the joint venture from those home sites.\nAt October 31, 2016, we had investments in these entities of $496.4 million, and were committed to invest or advance up to an additional $273.8 million to these entities if they require additional funding. At October 31, 2016, we had agreed to terms for the acquisition of 240 home sites from two Land Development Joint Ventures for an estimated aggregate purchase price of $79.2 million. In addition, we expect to purchase approximately 3,600 additional home sites over a number of years from several joint ventures in which we have interests; the purchase price of these home sites will be determined at a future date.\nThe unconsolidated entities in which we have investments generally finance their activities with a combination of partner equity and debt financing. In some instances, we and our partners have guaranteed debt of certain unconsolidated entities. These guarantees may include any or all of the following: (i) project completion guarantees, including any cost overruns; (ii) repayment guarantees, generally covering a percentage of the outstanding loan; (iii) carry cost guarantees, which cover costs such as interest. real estate taxes, and insurance; (iv) an environmental indemnity provided to the lender that holds the lender harmless from and against losses arising from the discharge of hazardous materials from the property and non-compliance with applicable environmental laws; and (v) indemnification of the lender from bad boy acts\u201d of the unconsolidated entity.\nIn some instances, the guarantees provided in connection with loans to an unconsolidated entity are joint and several. In these situations, we generally have a reimbursement agreement with our partner that provides that neither party is responsible for more than its proportionate share or agreed-upon share of the guarantee; however, if the joint venture partner does not have adequate financial resources to meet its obligations under the reimbursement agreement, we may be liable for more than our proportionate share.\nWe believe that as of October 31, 2016, in the event we become legally obligated to perform under a guarantee of the obligation of an unconsolidated entity due to a triggering event, the collateral should be sufficient to repay a significant portion of the obligation. If it is not, we and our partners would need to contribute additional capital to the venture. At October 31, 2016, the unconsolidated entities that have guarantees related to debt had loan commitments aggregating $875.7 million and had borrowed an aggregate of $576.0 million. We estimate that our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees, if the full amount of the loan commitments were borrowed, would be $875.7 million, without taking into account any recoveries from the underlying collateral or any reimbursement from our partners. Of this maximum potential exposure, $87.0 million is related to repayment and carry cost guarantees. Based on the amounts borrowed at October 31, 2016, our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees is estimated to be $576.0 million, without taking into account any recoveries from the underlying collateral or any reimbursement from our partners. Of the estimated $576.0 million, $61.5 million is related to repayment and carry cost guarantees.\nIn addition, we have guaranteed approximately $4.3 million of ground lease payments and insurance deductibles for three joint ventures.\nFor more information regarding these joint ventures, see Note 4, Investments in Unconsolidated Entities\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe trends, uncertainties or other factors that negatively impact our business and the industry in general also impact the unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. We review each of our investments on a quarterly basis for indicators of impairment. A series of operating losses of an investee, the inability to recover our invested capital, or other factors may indicate that a loss in value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity has occurred. If a loss exists, we further review to determine if the loss is other than temporary, in which case we write down the investment to its fair value. The evaluation of our investment in unconsolidated entities entails a detailed cash flow analysis using many estimates including but not limited to, expected sales pace, expected sales prices, expected incentives, costs incurred and anticipated, sufficiency of financing and capital, competition, market conditions and anticipated cash receipts, in order to determine projected future distributions. Each of the unconsolidated entities evaluates its inventory in a similar manner. In addition, for rental properties, we review rental trends, expected future expenses, and expected future cash flows to determine estimated fair values of the properties. See Critical Accounting Policies - Inventory\u201d contained in this MD&A for more detailed disclosure on our evaluation of inventory. If a valuation adjustment is recorded by an unconsolidated entity related to its assets, our proportionate share is reflected in income from unconsolidated entities with a corresponding decrease to our investment in unconsolidated entities. Based upon\nour evaluation of the fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities, we determined that no impairments of our investments occurred in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table compares certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and other supplemental information for fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 ($ amounts in millions, unless otherwise stated).

The increase in the fiscal 2016 percentage was primarily due to the recognition in fiscal 2016 of $125.6 million (2.4% of revenues) of warranty charges primarily related to older homes built in Pennsylvania and Delaware, as compared to $14.7 million (0.4% of revenues) in fiscal 2015 and slightly higher land and construction costs as a percentage of revenues in homes delivered in fiscal 2016, as\ncompared to fiscal 2015. These increased costs were offset, in part, by lower interest expense and inventory impairment and write-offs as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. See Note 6 - Accrued Expenses\u201d in Item 15(a)1 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these warranty charges.\nInterest cost in fiscal 2016 was $160.3 million or 3.1% of revenues, as compared to $142.9 million or 3.4% of revenues in fiscal 2015. We recognized inventory impairments and write-offs of $13.8 million or 0.3% of revenues and $35.7 million or 0.9% of revenues in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ( SG&A\u201d)\nSG&A spending increased by $80.3 million but declined as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the fiscal 2016 period was due to SG&A spending increasing by 17.6% while revenues increased 23.9% from the fiscal 2015 period. The dollar increase in SG&A was due primarily to increased compensation costs due to a higher number of employees and increased sales and marketing costs. The higher sales and marketing costs were the result of the increased number of homes closed and increased number of selling communities that we had in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.\nINCOME FROM UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES\nWe recognize our proportionate share of the earnings and losses from the various unconsolidated entities in which we have an investment. Many of our unconsolidated entities are land development projects or high-rise/mid-rise condominium construction projects, which do not generate revenues and earnings for a number of years during the development of the property. Once development is complete, these unconsolidated entities will generally, over a relatively short period of time, generate revenues and earnings until all of the assets of the entity are sold. Because there is not a steady flow of revenues and earnings from these entities, the earnings recognized from these entities will vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nIn fiscal 2016, we recognized $40.7 million of income from unconsolidated entities, as compared to $21.1 million in fiscal 2015. The increase in income from unconsolidated entities in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was due mainly to higher earnings from two of our City Living Home Building Joint Ventures, a $4.9 million gain recognized related to the sale of our ownership interests in one of our joint ventures located in New Jersey, and to the recognition of a $2.9 million recovery in fiscal 2016 of previously incurred charges related to a joint venture located in Nevada, offset, in part, by lower income from our Land Development Joint Ventures.\nOTHER INCOME - NET\nThe table below provides the components of Other Income - net\u201d for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 (amounts in thousands):\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from ancillary businesses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gibraltar\n</td> <td>6,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fee income from unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>10,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from land sales\n</td> <td>13,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>10,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income - net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, our security monitoring business recognized gains of $1.6 million and $8.1 million, respectively, from a bulk sale of security monitoring accounts in fiscal 2015, which is included in income from ancillary businesses above. The decline in income from Gibraltar Capital and Asset Management, LLC ( Gibraltar\u201d) was due primarily from the continuing monetization of its assets offset, in part by a $1.3 million gain in fiscal 2016 from the sale of a 76% interest in certain assets of Gibraltar. See Note 4, Investments in Unconsolidated Entities - Gibraltar Joint Ventures\u201d of this Form 10-K for additional information on this transaction.\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES\nIn fiscal 2016, we reported income before income taxes of $589.0 million, as compared to $535.6 million in fiscal 2015.\nINCOME TAX PROVISION\nWe recognized a $206.9 million income tax provision in fiscal 2016. Based upon the federal statutory rate of 35%, our federal tax provision would have been $206.2 million. The difference between our tax provision recognized and the tax provision based on the federal statutory rate was due mainly to the recognition of a $27.0 million provision for state income taxes; the recognition of a $2.1 million provision for uncertain tax positions taken; $2.0 million of accrued interest and penalties for previously accrued taxes on uncertain tax positions; and $3.9 million of other differences; offset by a $16.9 million tax benefit from the utilization of the domestic production activities deduction; the reversal of $11.2 million of previously accrued tax provisions on uncertain tax positions that were no longer necessary due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and settlements with certain taxing jurisdictions; and $7.0 million of other permanent deductions.\nWe recognized a $172.4 million income tax provision in fiscal 2015. Based upon the federal statutory rate of 35%, our federal tax provision would have been $187.4 million. The difference between our tax provision recognized and the tax provision based on the federal statutory rate was due principally to the reversal of $15.3 million of previously accrued tax provisions on uncertain tax positions that were no longer necessary due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and the settlements with certain taxing jurisdictions; a $12.3 million tax benefit from our utilization of the domestic production activities deduction; a benefit of $12.6 million from the reversal of state deferred tax asset valuation allowances, net of $3.7 million of new state deferred tax asset valuation allowances recognized; and $7.8 million of other permanent deductions; offset, in part, by the recognition of a $21.9 million provision for state income taxes; the recognition of a $3.2 million provision for uncertain tax positions taken; $2.6 million of accrued interest and penalties for previously accrued taxes on uncertain tax positions; and $5.3 million of other differences.\nFISCAL 2015 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2014\nREVENUES AND COST OF REVENUES\nRevenues in fiscal 2015 were higher than those for fiscal 2014 by approximately $259.6 million, or 6.6%. This increase was attributable to a 4.2% increase in the average price of the homes delivered and a 2.4% increase in the number of homes delivered. In fiscal 2015, we delivered 5,525 homes with a value of $4.17 billion, as compared to 5,397 homes in fiscal 2014 with a value of $3.91 billion. The increase in the number of homes delivered was principally due to a greater number of homes being sold and delivered in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. The increase in the average price of homes delivered was primarily attributable to a shift in the number of homes delivered to more expensive areas and/or products and increased selling prices of homes delivered in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014.\nCost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was 78.4% in fiscal 2015, as compared to 78.8% in fiscal 2014.The decrease in cost of revenues in fiscal 2015 as a percentage of revenues, as compared to fiscal 2014, was due primarily to a change in product mix/areas to higher-margin areas, increased prices of homes delivered in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, the lower charge recognized for warranty and litigation in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, and the lower impact of the application of purchase accounting from the homes delivered from the Acquisition in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. These decreases were offset, in part, by increased construction costs and higher higher inventory impairment charges and write-offs in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015 and 2014, we recognized inventory impairment charges of $35.7 million or 0.9% of revenues and $20.7 million or 0.5% of revenues, respectively. In addition, in fiscal 2015 and 2014, we recognized charges related to warranty and litigation, net of other reversals, of $11.0 million and $24.0 million, respectively. See Note 6 - Accrued Expenses\u201d in Item 15(a)1 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these warranty charges.\nInterest cost in fiscal 2015 was $142.9 million or 3.4% of revenues, as compared to $137.5 million or 3.5% of revenues in fiscal 2014.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ( SG&A\u201d)\nSG&A increased by $22.6 million in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A decreased to 10.9% in fiscal 2015, from 11.1% in fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2014 SG&A includes $6.1 million of expenses incurred in the Acquisition. The dollar increase in SG&A costs, excluding the acquisition costs, was due primarily to increased compensation costs due to our increased number of employees, and increased sales and marketing costs. The higher sales and marketing costs were the result of the increased spending on advertising and increased operating costs due to the increased number of selling communities that we had in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014.\nINCOME FROM UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES\nWe recognize our proportionate share of the earnings and losses from the various unconsolidated entities in which we have an investment. Many of our unconsolidated entities are land development projects or high-rise/mid-rise condominium construction\nprojects, which do not generate revenues and earnings for a number of years during the development of the property. Once development is complete, these unconsolidated entities will generally, over a relatively short period of time, generate revenues and earnings until all of the assets of the entity are sold. Because there is not a steady flow of revenues and earnings from these entities, the earnings recognized from these entities will vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nIn fiscal 2015, we recognized $21.1 million of income from unconsolidated entities, as compared to $41.1 million in fiscal 2014. The decrease in income from unconsolidated entities was due primarily to our recognition of a $23.5 million gain representing our share of the gain on the sale by a Rental Property Joint Venture of substantially all of its assets in December 2013 and a $12.0 million distribution from the Trust in April 2014 due to the refinancing of one of the Trust's apartment properties. This was offset, in part, by higher income realized from several of our Land Development Joint Ventures and one Home Building Joint Venture in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. The higher income from these joint ventures was attributable primarily to higher sales activity and/or price increases in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014.\nOTHER INCOME - NET\nThe table below provides the components of Other Income - net\u201d for the years ended October 31, 2015 and 2014 (amounts in thousands):\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from ancillary businesses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gibraltar\n</td> <td>10,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fee income from unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>11,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from land sales\n</td> <td>13,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>9,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income - net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn fiscal 2015, our security monitoring business recognized an $8.1 million gain from a bulk sale of security monitoring accounts, which is included in income from ancillary businesses above. The decrease in income from Gibraltar's operations in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily due to a reduction in gains recognized from the disposition of real estate owned ( REO\u201d) and from the acquisition of REO through foreclosure. The increase in management fee income in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily due to the increase in activity from the unconsolidated entities that we manage. The decrease in income from land sales was due to fewer land parcels being available for sale in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014.\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES\nIn fiscal 2015, we reported income before income taxes of $535.6 million, as compared to $504.6 million in fiscal 2014.\nINCOME TAX PROVISION\nWe recognized a $172.4 million income tax provision in fiscal 2015. Based upon the federal statutory rate of 35%, our federal tax provision would have been $187.4 million. The difference between our tax provision recognized and the tax provision based on the federal statutory rate was due mainly to the reversal of $15.3 million of previously accrued tax provisions on uncertain tax positions that were no longer necessary due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and settlements with certain taxing jurisdictions; a $12.3 million tax benefit from the utilization of the domestic production activities deduction; a benefit of $12.6 million from the reversal of state deferred tax asset valuation allowances, net of $3.7 million of new state deferred tax asset valuation allowances recognized; and $7.8 million of other permanent deductions; offset, in part, by the recognition of a $21.9 million provision for state income taxes; the recognition of a $3.2 million provision for uncertain tax positions taken; $2.6 million of accrued interest and penalties for previously accrued taxes on uncertain tax positions; and $5.3 million of other differences.\nWe recognized a $164.6 million income tax provision in fiscal 2014. Based upon the federal statutory rate of 35%, our federal tax provision would have been $176.6 million. The difference between our tax provision recognized, excluding the changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance, and the tax provision based on the federal statutory rate was due principally to the reversal of $11.0 million of previously accrued tax provisions on uncertain tax positions that were no longer necessary due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and the settlement of state income tax audits; a $14.8 million tax benefit from our utilization of domestic production activities deductions; a $12.3 million tax benefit from our utilization of the domestic production activities deduction; a benefit of $12.0 million from the reversal of state deferred tax asset valuation allowances, net of $1.3 million of new state deferred tax asset valuation allowances recognized; and a $6.2 million tax benefit related to other miscellaneous permanent deductions, offset, in part, by a $23.8 million provision for state income taxes; the recognition of a\n$5.7 million provision for uncertain tax positions taken; and $1.8 million of accrued interest and penalties for previously accrued taxes on uncertain tax positions.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nFunding for our business has been, and continues to be, provided principally by cash flow from operating activities before inventory additions, unsecured bank borrowings, and the public debt and equity markets. At October 31, 2016, we had $633.7 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and approximately $961.8 million available for borrowing under our New Credit Facility.\nCash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2016 was $148.8 million. It was generated primarily from $382.1 million of net income plus $26.7 million of stock-based compensation, $23.1 million of depreciation and amortization, $13.8 million of inventory impairments and write-offs, and $19.3 million of deferred taxes; an increase of $524.6 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses; a $27.8 million increase in customer deposits; and a $6.0 million increase in income taxes payable; offset, in part, by the net purchase of $391.2 million of inventory; a $307.4 million increase in receivables, prepaid expenses, and other assets; and an increase of $124.9 million in mortgage loans originated, net of the sale of mortgage loans to outside investors.\nCash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2016 was $8.2 million. The cash provided by investing activities was primarily related to $97.4 million of cash received as returns on our investments in unconsolidated entities, foreclosed real estate, and distressed loans and $10.0 million of proceeds from the the sale of marketable securities, offset, in part, by $69.7 million used to fund investments in unconsolidated entities and $28.4 million for the purchase of property and equipment.\nWe used $442.3 million of cash from financing activities in fiscal 2016, primarily for the repurchase of $392.8 million of our common stock; the repayment of $100.0 million from our credit facilities, net of new borrowing under them; and the repayment of $69.0 million of other loans payable, net of new borrowings, offset, in part, by $110.0 million of new borrowings under our mortgage company loan facility, net of repayments.\nAt October 31, 2015, we had $929.0 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on hand and approximately $566.1 million available for borrowing under our $1.035 billion revolving credit facility ( Credit Facility\u201d). Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2015 was $60.2 million. It was generated primarily from $363.2 million of net income plus $22.9 million of stock-based compensation, $23.6 million of depreciation and amortization, $35.7 million of inventory impairments and write-offs, and $62.1 million of deferred taxes; a $46.5 million increase in customer deposits; and an increase of $28.7 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses; offset, in part, by the net purchase of $352.0 million of inventory; a $65.5 million decrease in income taxes payable; a $55.6 million increase in receivables, prepaid expenses, and other assets; and an increase of $21.4 million in mortgage loans originated, net of the sale of mortgage loans to outside investors.\nCash used in our investing activities during fiscal 2015 was $52.8 million. The cash used in investing activities was primarily related to $123.9 million used to fund investments in unconsolidated entities, $9.4 million for the purchase of property and equipment, offset, in part, by $77.4 million of cash received as returns on our investments in unconsolidated entities, foreclosed real estate, and distressed loans.\nWe generated $325.3 million of cash from financing activities in fiscal 2015, primarily from the issuance of $350.0 million of 4.875% Senior Notes due 2025; $350.0 million of borrowing under our Credit Facility; and $39.5 million from the proceeds of our stock-based benefit plans, offset, in part, by the repayment of $300.0 million of senior notes; the repurchase of $56.9 million of our common stock; and the repayment of $55.0 million of other loans payable, net of new borrowings.\nAt October 31, 2014, we had $598.3 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on hand and approximately $940.2 million available for borrowing under our Credit Facility. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2014 was $313.2 million. It was generated primarily from $340.0 million of net income plus $21.7 million of stock-based compensation, $23.0 million of depreciation and amortization, $20.7 million of inventory impairments and write-offs, and $47.4 million of deferred taxes; an $82.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses; and a $52.4 million increase in income taxes payable; offset, in part, by the net purchase of $272.0 million of inventory.\nCash used in our investing activities during fiscal 2014 was $1.45 billion. The cash used in investing activities was primarily related to the $1.49 billion used to acquire Shapell; $113.0 million used to fund investments in unconsolidated entities; $15.1 million for the purchase of property and equipment; offset, in part, by $127.0 million of cash received as returns on our investments in unconsolidated entities, distressed loans, and foreclosed real estate, and $40.2 million of sales of marketable securities.\nWe generated $952.2 million of cash from financing activities in fiscal 2014, primarily from the issuance of 7.2 million shares of our common stock in November 2013 that raised $220.4 million; $595.3 million from the issuance in November 2013 of\n$350.0 million of 4.0% Senior Notes due 2018 and $250.0 million of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2024; the borrowing of $500.0 million under a five-year term loan from a syndicate of eleven banks; and $28.4 million from the proceeds of our stock-based benefit plans, offset, in part, by the repayment of $268.0 million of our 4.95% Senior Notes in March 2014; the repurchase of $90.8 million of our common stock; and the repayment of $40.8 million of other loans payable, net of new borrowings.\nIn general, our cash flow from operating activities assumes that, as each home is delivered, we will purchase a home site to replace it. Because we own a supply of several years of home sites, we do not need to buy home sites immediately to replace those that we deliver. In addition, we generally do not begin construction of our detached homes until we have a signed contract with the home buyer. Should our business decline, we believe that our inventory levels would decrease as we complete and deliver the homes under construction but do not commence construction of as many new homes, as we complete the improvements on the land we already own, and as we sell and deliver the speculative homes that we have currently in inventory, resulting in additional cash flow from operations. In addition, we might delay or curtail our acquisition of additional land, as we did during the period April 2006 through January 2010, which would further reduce our inventory levels and cash needs. At October 31, 2016, we owned or controlled through options 48,837 home sites, as compared to 44,253 at October 31, 2015; and 47,167 at October 31, 2014. Of the 48,837 home sites owned or controlled through options at October 31, 2016, we owned 34,137. Of our owned home sites at October 31, 2016, significant improvements were completed on approximately 17,065 of them.\nIn February 2014, we acquired all of the equity interests in Shapell, consisting of Shapell's single-family residential real property development business, including a portfolio of approximately 4,950 home sites in California. For more information regarding the Shapell acquisition, see Note 2, Acquisitions\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nAt October 31, 2016, the aggregate purchase price of land parcels under option and purchase agreements was approximately $1.62 billion (including $79.2 million of land to be acquired from joint ventures in which we have invested). Of the $1.62 billion of land purchase commitments, we had paid or deposited $65.3 million and, if we acquire all of these land parcels, we will be required to pay an additional $1.56 billion. The purchases of these land parcels are scheduled over the next several years. We have additional land parcels under option that have been excluded from the aforementioned aggregate purchase amounts since we do not believe that we will complete the purchase of these land parcels and no additional funds will be required from us to terminate these contracts.\nDuring the past several years, we have made a number of investments in unconsolidated entities related to the acquisition and development of land for future home sites, the construction of luxury for-sale condominiums, and for-rent apartments. Our investment activities related to investments in and distributions of investments from unconsolidated entities are contained in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows under Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities,\u201d At October 31, 2016, we had investments in these entities of $496.4 million, and were committed to invest or advance up to an additional $273.8 million to these entities if they require additional funding.\nOn May 19, 2016, we entered into a new $1.215 billion (subsequently increased to $1.295 billion), five-year, unsecured New Credit Facility and terminated our $1.035 billion Credit Facility that was scheduled to terminate on August 1, 2018. Under the terms of the New Credit Facility, our maximum leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) may not exceed 1.75 to 1.00 and we are required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth (as defined in the credit agreement) of no less than approximately $2.60 billion. Under the terms of the New Credit Facility, at October 31, 2016, our leverage ratio was approximately 0.71 to 1.00 and our tangible net worth was approximately $4.18 billion. Based upon the minimum tangible net worth requirement, our ability to repurchase our common stock was limited to approximately $2.13 billion as of October 31, 2016. At October 31, 2016, we had $250.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the New Credit Facility and had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $83.2 million.\nWe believe that we will have adequate resources and sufficient access to the capital markets and external financing sources to continue to fund our current operations and meet our contractual obligations. Due to the uncertainties in the economy and for home builders in general, we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace existing financing or find sources of additional financing in the future.\nINFLATION\nThe long-term impact of inflation on us is manifested in increased costs for land, land development, construction, and overhead. We generally enter into contracts to acquire land a significant period of time before development and sales efforts begin. Accordingly, to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed, subsequent increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes will affect our profits. Because the sales price of each of our homes is fixed at the time a buyer enters into a contract to purchase a home and because we generally contract to sell our homes before we begin construction, any inflation of costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins. We generally attempt to minimize that effect by entering into\nfixed-price contracts with our subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time, which generally do not exceed one year.\nIn general, housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates and housing costs. Interest rates, the length of time that land remains in inventory, and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect our interest costs. If we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs, or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly, affecting prospective buyers' ability to adequately finance home purchases, our revenues, gross margins, and net income could be adversely affected. Increases in sales prices, whether the result of inflation or demand, may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford new homes.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table summarizes our estimated contractual payment obligations at October 31, 2016 (amounts in millions):\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 - 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020 - 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior notes (a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>539.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>834.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>396.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,552.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,323.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans payable (a)\n</td> <td>46.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>782.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>979.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage company loan facility (a)\n</td> <td>215.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>215.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (b)\n</td> <td>889.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>645.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>302.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,012.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retirement plans (c)\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,716.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,584.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,368.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,982.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,651.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Amounts include estimated annual interest payments until maturity of the debt.

</tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the average price of homes delivered in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was primarily attributable to a shift in the number of homes delivered to more expensive areas and/or products and increases in selling prices of homes delivered in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in the number of homes delivered in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was mainly due to increases in the number of homes closed in Michigan and New Jersey, partially offset by a decrease in the number of homes closed in Illinois. The increase in the number of homes closed in New Jersey was primarily due to higher backlog conversion in the fiscal 2016 period, as compared to the fiscal 2015 period. In Michigan, the increase was principally due to an increase in the number of homes in backlog as of October 31, 2015, as compared to the number of homes in backlog at October 31, 2014.\nThe increase in the number of net contracts signed in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was mainly due to improved market conditions in Michigan, New York, and New Jersey, offset, in part by decreases in Connecticut and Illinois where demand has declined, and in Massachusetts due to a decrease in the number of selling communities. The increase in the average sales price of net contracts signed was principally attributable to a shift in the number of contracts signed to more expensive areas and/or products and increases in base selling prices in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.\nThe 30% increase in income before income taxes in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was principally attributable to higher earnings from increased revenues and lower inventory impairment charges, offset, in part, by higher cost of revenues, excluding inventory impairment charges, as a percentage of revenues, and higher SG&A costs. During our review of communities for impairment in fiscal 2016 and 2015, primarily due to a lack of improvement and/or a decrease in customer demand as a result of weaker than expected market conditions, we determined that the pricing assumptions used in prior impairment reviews for three operating communities (two located in Connecticut and one in suburban New York) in fiscal 2016, and two operating communities (one located in suburban New York and one located in New Jersey) in fiscal 2015, needed to be reduced. As a result of these reductions in expected sales prices, we determined that these communities were impaired. Accordingly, the carrying values of these communities were written down to their estimated fair values resulting in charges to income before taxes of $7.3 million and $13.9 million in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. Total inventory impairment charges for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 were $7.6 million and $15.0 million, respectively.

See Note 6 - Accrued Expenses\u201d in Item 15(a)1 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these warranty charges.\nInventory impairment charges were $2.1 million, as compared to $19.5 million in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. The impairment charges in fiscal 2016 primarily related to a land purchase contract in Delaware where we were unable to obtain the required approvals to proceed with our development of the underlying property. Accordingly, we terminated the contract and wrote off costs incurred. In fiscal 2015, due to the weakness in certain housing markets in Maryland and West Virginia, we decided to sell or look for alternate uses for two parcels of land rather than develop them as previously intended. The carrying values of these communities were written down to their estimated fair values resulting in charges to income before taxes of $11.9 million. We sold one parcel of land during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. In addition, during our review of operating communities for impairment in fiscal 2015, primarily due to a lack of improvement and/or a decrease in customer demand as a result of weaker than expected market conditions, we determined that the pricing assumptions used in prior impairment reviews for one operating community located in Virginia needed to be reduced. As a result of this reduction in expected sales prices, we determined that this community was impaired. Accordingly, the carrying value of this community was written down to its estimated fair value resulting in a charge to income before taxes in fiscal 2015 of $3.1 million.\nSouth\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended October 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Units Delivered and Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>849.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>892.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Units delivered\n</td> <td>1,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average delivered price ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>777.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>759.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Contracts Signed:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net contract value ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>916.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>838.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net contracted units\n</td> <td>1,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average contracted price ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>746.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>809.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>79.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in the number of homes delivered in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was principally due a decrease in the number of homes in backlog as of October 31, 2015, as compared to the number of homes in backlog at October 31, 2014.

The increase in the average price of homes delivered in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was primarily due to a shift in the number of homes delivered to more expensive areas and/or products and increased selling prices of homes delivered.\nThe decrease in the number of net contracts signed in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was due primarily to (1) a temporary lack of inventory, primarily in northern California, as we are transitioning between a number of communities that are selling out, and thus have limited inventory, and the opening of new communities and (2) reduced demand resulting from our decision to increase prices in a number of communities with large backlogs to maximize the value of our inventory. Fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by the continued reduction in demand in our Porter Ranch master planned community in Southern California due to a natural gas leak on unaffiliated land approximately one mile away. In mid-February 2016, the State of California announced that the leak had been permanently sealed. Recent testing has verified that air quality is back to normal levels and, therefore, we are optimistic that operations will gradually return to normal at our Porter Ranch master planned community.

These increases to the loss before income taxes were partially offset by a $4.9 million gain recognized related to the sale of our ownership interests in one of our joint ventures located in New Jersey in the fiscal 2016 period.\nFISCAL 2015 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2014\nTraditional Home Building\nNorth\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended October 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Units Delivered and Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>702.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>662.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Units delivered\n</td> <td>1,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average delivered price ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>623.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>597.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Contracts Signed:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net contract value ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>756.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>664.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net contracted units\n</td> <td>1,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average contracted price ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>665.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>639.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>82.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the average price of homes delivered in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily attributable to a shift in the number of homes delivered to more expensive areas and/or products and increases in selling prices of homes delivered in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014.\nThe increase in the number of net contracts signed in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, was mainly due to improved market conditions in Michigan and New Jersey. The increase in the average sales price of net contracts signed was principally attributable to a shift in the number of contracts signed to more expensive areas and/or products and increases in base selling prices in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014.\nThe 4% increase in income in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily attributable to higher earnings from the increased revenues and lower cost of revenues as a percent of revenues, excluding impairment, offset, in part, by higher inventory impairment charges, higher SG&A costs, and lower earnings from land sales in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. We recognized inventory impairment charges of $15.0 million and $9.1 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in cost of revenues as a percent of revenues, excluding impairments, was mainly due to a change in product mix/areas to higher margin areas in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014.\nMid-Atlantic\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended October 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Units Delivered and Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>845.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>817.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Units delivered\n</td> <td>1,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average delivered price ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>629.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>632.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Contracts Signed:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net contract value ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>844.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>763.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net contracted units\n</td> <td>1,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average contracted price ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>638.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>626.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>84.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the number of homes delivered in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, was mainly due to a greater number of homes being sold and delivered in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014.\nThe increase in the number of net contracts signed in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily due to an increase in demand in Pennsylvania and Virginia, offset, in part, by a decrease in the number of net contracts signed in Maryland. The increase in the average sales price of net contracts signed was mainly due to a shift in the number of contracts signed to more expensive areas and/or products and increases in base selling prices in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014.\nThe 13% decrease in income before income taxes in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily due to higher impairment charges, higher SG&A costs, and a $2.8 million decrease in earnings from land sales in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. These decreases were partially offset by higher earnings from increased revenues and lower warranty charges, primarily for older homes built in communities located in Pennsylvania and Delaware, in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. Inventory impairment charges, in fiscal 2015 and 2014, were $19.5 million and $9.1 million, respectively. The earnings from land sales in fiscal 2014 mainly represented previously deferred gains on our initial sales of properties to a Rental Property Joint Venture, which sold substanitally of of its assets in fiscal 2014.

The decrease in the number of net contracts signed was mainly due to slower demand in the first three months of fiscal 2015 and to a decline in the number of net contracts signed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, due to lower product availability.\nThe 19% increase in income in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily attributable to higher earnings from increased revenues in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, $3.6 million of earnings from the sale of commercial space at one of our high-rise buildings in New York City in fiscal 2015, and a charge of $2.6 million to our earnings due to a settled litigation at one of our unconsolidated entities in fiscal 2014, partially offset by higher SG&A costs in fiscal 2015, as compared to 2014.\nOther\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended October 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(115.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(85.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the loss before income taxes in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, was principally due to a decrease in income from unconsolidated entities from $42.0 million in fiscal 2014 to $5.7 million in fiscal 2015, decreased income from our Gibraltar operations, and higher SG&A costs in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, offset, in part, by an increase of $12.9 million in income from ancillary businesses in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease in income from unconsolidated entities was due primarily to our recognition of a $23.5 million gain representing our share of the gain on the sale by a Rental Property Joint venture, which sold substantially all of its assets in December 2013 and a $12.0 million distribution from the Trust in April 2014 due to the refinancing of one of the Trust's apartment properties.

It also should be read in conjunction with the disclosure under Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in Part 1 of this Form 10-K.\nWhen this report uses the words we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d and the Company,\u201d they refer to Toll Brothers, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. References herein to fiscal year refer to our fiscal years ended or ending October 31.\nUnless otherwise stated in this report, net contracts signed represents a number or value equal to the gross number or value of contracts signed during the relevant period, less the number or value of contracts canceled during the relevant period, which includes contracts that were signed during the relevant period and in prior periods. Backlog consists of homes under contract but not yet delivered to our home buyers ( backlog\u201d).\nOVERVIEW\nOur Business\nWe design, build, market, sell, and arrange financing for detached and attached homes in luxury residential communities. We cater to move-up, empty-nester, active-adult, age-qualified, and second-home buyers in the United States ( Traditional Home Building Product\u201d). We also build and sell homes in urban infill markets through Toll Brothers City Living\u00ae ( City Living\u201d). At October 31, 2016, we were operating in 19 states. In the five years ended October 31, 2016, we delivered 24,490 homes from 621 communities, including 6,098 homes from 377 communities in fiscal 2016.\nIn February 2014, we acquired the home building business of Shapell Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Shapell\u201d), and in November 2016, we acquired substantially all of the assets and operations of Coleman Real Estate Holdings, LLC ( Coleman\u201d). See Acquisitions\u201d below for more information.\nWe are developing several land parcels for master planned communities in which we intend to build homes on a portion of the lots and sell the remaining lots to other builders. Two of these master planned communities are being developed 100% by us, and the remaining communities are being developed through joint ventures with other builders or financial partners.\nIn addition to our residential for-sale business, we also develop and operate for-rent apartments through joint ventures. See the section entitled Toll Brothers Apartment Living/Toll Brothers Campus Living/Toll Brothers Realty Trust\u201d below.\nWe operate our own land development, architectural, engineering, mortgage, title, landscaping, security monitoring, lumber distribution, house component assembly, and manufacturing operations. In addition, in certain markets, we develop land for sale to other builders, often through joint venture structures with other builders or with financial partners. We also develop, own, and operate golf courses and country clubs, which generally are associated with several of our master planned communities.\nWe have investments in various unconsolidated entities. We have investments in joint ventures (i) to develop land for the joint venture participants and for sale to outside builders ( Land Development Joint Ventures\u201d); (ii) to develop for-sale homes ( Home Building Joint Ventures\u201d); (iii) to develop luxury for-rent residential apartments, commercial space and a hotel ( Rental Property Joint Ventures\u201d); and (iv) to invest in distressed loans and real estate and provide financing for residential builders and developers for the acquisition and development of land and home sites ( Gibraltar Joint Ventures\u201d).\nFinancial Highlights\nIn fiscal 2016, we recognized $5.17 billion of revenues and net income of $382.1 million, as compared to $4.17 billion of revenues and net income of $363.2 million in fiscal 2015.\nIn fiscal 2016 and 2015, the value of net contracts signed was $5.65 billion (6,719 homes) and $4.96 billion (5,910 homes), respectively. The value of our backlog at October 31, 2016 was $3.98 billion (4,685 homes), as compared to our backlog at October 31, 2015 of $3.50 billion (4,064 homes).\nAt October 31, 2016, we had $633.7 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and approximately $961.8 million for borrowing available under our $1.295 billion revolving credit facility ( New Credit Facility\u201d) that matures in May 2021. At October 31, 2016, we had $250.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the New Credit Facility and had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $83.2 million.\nAt October 31, 2016, our total equity and our debt to total capitalization ratio were $4.24 billion and 0.47 to 1:00, respectively,\nAcquisitions\nShapell Industries, Inc.\nOn February 4, 2014, we completed our acquisition of Shapell pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) dated November 6, 2013 with Shapell Investment Properties, Inc. ( SIPI\u201d). We acquired all of the equity interests in Shapell from SIPI on February 4, 2014 for $1.49 billion, net of cash acquired (the Acquisition\u201d). We acquired the single-family residential real property development business of Shapell, including a portfolio of approximately 4,950 home sites in California, some of which we have sold to other builders. The Acquisition provided us with a premier California land portfolio including 11 active selling communities, as of the Acquisition date, in affluent, high-growth markets: the San Francisco Bay area, metro Los Angeles, Orange County, and the Carlsbad market. As part of the Acquisition, we assumed contracts to deliver 126 homes with an aggregate value of approximately $105.3 million. The Shapell operations have been fully integrated into our operations.\nColeman Real Estate Holdings, LLC\nIn October 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets and operations of Coleman. In November 2016, we completed the acquisition of Coleman for approximately $85.2 million in cash. The assets acquired were primarily inventory, including approximately 1,750 home sites owned or controlled through land purchase agreements. As part of the acquisition, we assumed contracts to deliver 128 homes with an aggregate value of $38.8 million. The average price of the undelivered homes at the date of acquisition was approximately $303,000. Our selling community count increased by 15 communities at the acquisition date.\nSee Note 2, Acquisitions,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these acquisitions.\nOur Business Environment and Current Outlook\nSince the third quarter of fiscal 2014 through the end of fiscal 2016, we saw a general strengthening in customer demand. In fiscal 2016, we signed 6,719 contracts with an aggregate value of $5.65 billion, compared to 5,910 contracts with an aggregate value of $4.96 billion in fiscal 2015, and 5,271 contracts with an aggregate value of $3.90 billion in fiscal 2014. We are optimistic that the strengthening in customer demand will continue for the foreseeable future. We believe that, as the national economy continues to improve and as the millennial generation comes of age, pent-up demand for homes will continue to be released.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau ( Census Bureau\u201d), the number of households earning $100,000 or more (in constant 2015 dollars) at September 2016 stood at 33.2 million, or approximately 26.4% of all U.S. households. This group has grown at three times the rate of increase of all U.S. households since 1980. According to Harvard University's 2016 report, The State of the Nation's Housing,\u201d demographic forces are likely to drive the addition of just under 1.3 million new households per year during the next decade.\nHousing starts, which encompass the units needed for household formations, second homes, and the replacement of obsolete or demolished units, have not kept pace with this projected household growth. According to the Census Bureau's October 2016 New Residential Sales Report, new home inventory stands at a supply of just 5.2 months, based on current sales paces. If demand and pace increase significantly, the supply of 5.2 months could quickly be drawn down. During the period 1970 through 2007, total housing starts in the United States averaged approximately 1.6 million per year, while during the period 2008 through 2015, total housing starts averaged approximately 0.81 million per year according to the Census Bureau.\nWe continue to believe that many of our communities are in desirable locations that are difficult to replace and in markets where approvals have been increasingly difficult to achieve. We believe that many of these communities have substantial embedded value that may be realized in the future as the housing recovery strengthens.\nCompetitive Landscape\nThe home building business is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with numerous home builders of varying sizes, ranging from local to national in scope, some of which have greater sales and financial resources than we do. Sales of existing homes, whether by a homeowner or by a financial institution that has acquired a home through a foreclosure, also provide competition. We compete primarily on the basis of price, location, design, quality, service, and reputation. We believe our financial stability, relative to many others in our industry, is a favorable competitive factor as more home buyers focus on builder solvency.\nIn addition, there are fewer and more selective lenders serving our industry as compared to prior years and we believe that these lenders gravitate to the home building companies that offer them the greatest security, the strongest balance sheets, and the broadest array of potential business opportunities.\nLand Acquisition and Development\nOur business is subject to many risks, because of the extended length of time that it takes to obtain the necessary approvals on a property, complete the land improvements on it, and deliver a home after a home buyer signs an agreement of sale. In certain cases, we attempt to reduce some of these risks by utilizing one or more of the following methods: controlling land for future development through options (also referred to herein as land purchase contracts\u201d or option and purchase agreements\u201d), which enable us to obtain necessary governmental approvals before acquiring title to the land; generally commencing construction of a detached home only after executing an agreement of sale and receiving a substantial down payment from the buyer; and using subcontractors to perform home construction and land development work on a fixed-price basis.\nDuring fiscal 2016 and 2015, we acquired control of approximately 10,682 home sites (net of options terminated and home sites sold) and, approximately 2,611 home sites (net of options terminated and home sites sold), respectively. At October 31, 2016, we controlled approximately 48,837 home sites, as compared to approximately 44,253 home sites at October 31, 2015, and 47,167 home sites at October 31, 2014. In addition, at October 31, 2016, we expect to purchase approximately 3,600 additional home sites from several land development joint ventures in which we have an interest, at prices not yet determined.\nOf the approximately 48,837 total home sites that we owned or controlled through options at October 31, 2016, we owned approximately 34,137 and controlled approximately 14,700 through options. Of the 48,837 home sites, approximately 17,065 were substantially improved. The 14,700 home sites controlled through options includes the 1,750 home sites owned or controlled by Coleman.\nIn addition, at October 31, 2016, our Land Development Joint Ventures owned approximately 11,400 home sites (including 240 home sites included in the 14,700 controlled through options), and our Homebuilding Joint Ventures owned approximately 400 home sites.\nAt October 31, 2016, we were selling from 310 communities, compared to 288 communities at October 31, 2015, and 263 communities at October 31, 2014.\nCustomer Mortgage Financing\nWe maintain relationships with a widely diversified group of mortgage financial institutions, many of which are among the largest in the industry. We believe that regional and community banks continue to recognize the long-term value in creating relationships with high-quality, affluent customers such as our home buyers, and these banks continue to provide such customers with financing.\nWe believe that our home buyers generally are, and should continue to be, better able to secure mortgages due to their typically lower loan-to-value ratios and attractive credit profiles, as compared to the average home buyer.\nToll Brothers Apartment Living/Toll Brothers Campus Living/Toll Brothers Realty Trust\nIn addition to our residential for-sale business, we also develop and operate for-rent apartments through joint ventures. At October 31, 2016, we controlled 28 land parcels as for-rent apartment projects containing approximately 9,600 units. These projects, which are located in the metro Boston to metro Washington, D.C. corridor; Atlanta, Georgia; Dallas, Texas; and Fremont, California are being operated, are being developed or will be developed with partners under the brand names Toll Brothers Apartment Living, Toll Brothers Campus Living and Toll Brothers Realty Trust (the Trust\u201d).\nAt October 31, 2016, we had approximately 2,950 units in for-rent apartment projects that were occupied or ready for occupancy, 600 units in the lease-up stage, 900 units under active development, and 5,150 units in the planning stage. Of the 9,600 units at October 31, 2016, 4,850 were owned by joint ventures in which we have an interest; approximately 1,600 were owned by us; 2,850 were under contract to be purchased by us; and 300 were under a letter of intent.\nCONTRACTS AND BACKLOG\nThe aggregate value of net sales contracts signed increased 14.0% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, and 27.2% in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. The value of net sales contracts signed was $5.65 billion (6,719 homes) in fiscal 2016, $4.96 billion (5,910 homes) in fiscal 2015, and $3.90 billion (5,271 homes) in fiscal 2014.\nThe increase in the aggregate value of net contracts signed in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was the result of a 13.7% increase in the number of net contracts signed. The increase in the number of net contracts signed in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was primarily due to the continued recovery in the U.S. housing market in fiscal 2016.\nThe value of our backlog at October 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $3.98 billion (4,685 homes), $3.50 billion (4,064 homes), and $2.72 billion (3,679 homes), respectively. Approximately 97% of the homes in backlog at October 31, 2016 are expected to be delivered by October 31, 2017. The 13.7% increase in the value of homes in backlog at October 31, 2016, as compared to October 31, 2015, was primarily due to a 14.0% increase in the value of net contracts signed in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, and the higher backlog at the beginning of fiscal 2016, as compared to the beginning of fiscal 2015, offset, in part, by a 23.9% increase in the aggregate value of our deliveries in fiscal 2016, as compared to the aggregate value of deliveries in fiscal 2015.\nThe 28.8% increase in the value of homes in backlog at October 31, 2015, as compared to October 31, 2014, was due to a 27.2% increase in the value of net contracts signed in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, and the higher backlog at the beginning of fiscal 2015, as compared to the beginning of fiscal 2014, offset, in part, by a 6.6% increase in the aggregate value of our deliveries in fiscal 2015, as compared to the aggregate value of deliveries in fiscal 2014.\nFor more information regarding revenues, net contracts signed, and backlog by geographic segment, see Segments\u201d in this MD&A.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nInventory\nInventory is stated at cost unless an impairment exists, in which case it is written down to fair value in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). In addition to direct land acquisition, land development, and home construction costs, costs also include interest, real estate taxes, and direct overhead related to development and construction, which are capitalized to inventory during periods beginning with the commencement of development and ending with the completion of construction. For those communities that have been temporarily closed, no additional capitalized interest is allocated to the community's inventory until it reopens, and other carrying costs are expensed as incurred. Once a parcel of land has been approved for development and we open the community, it can typically take four or more years to fully develop, sell, and deliver all the homes in that community. Longer or shorter time periods are possible depending on the number of home sites in a community and the sales and delivery pace of the homes in a community. Our master planned communities, consisting of several smaller communities, may take up to 10 years or more to complete. Because our inventory is considered a long-lived asset under GAAP, we are required to regularly review the carrying value of each of our communities and write down the value of those communities when we believe the values are not recoverable.\nOperating Communities: When the profitability of an operating community deteriorates, the sales pace declines significantly, or some other factor indicates a possible impairment in the recoverability of the asset, the asset is reviewed for impairment by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flow for the community to its carrying value. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flow is less than the community's carrying value, the carrying value is written down to its estimated fair value. Estimated fair value is primarily determined by discounting the estimated future cash flow of each community. The impairment is charged to cost of revenues in the period in which the impairment is determined. In estimating the future undiscounted cash flow of a community, we use various estimates such as (i) the expected sales pace in a community, based upon general economic conditions that will have a short-term or long-term impact on the market in which the community is located and on competition within the market, including the number of home sites available and pricing and incentives being offered in other communities owned by us or by other builders; (ii) the expected sales prices and sales incentives to be offered in a community; (iii) costs expended to date and expected to be incurred in the future, including, but not limited to, land and land development costs, home construction, interest, and overhead costs; (iv) alternative product offerings that may be offered in a community that will have an impact on sales pace, sales price, building cost, or the number of homes that can be built in a particular community; and (v) alternative uses for the property, such as the possibility of a sale of the entire community to another builder or the sale of individual home sites.\nFuture Communities: We evaluate all land held for future communities or future sections of operating communities, whether owned or optioned, to determine whether or not we expect to proceed with the development of the land as originally contemplated. This evaluation encompasses the same types of estimates used for operating communities described above, as well as an evaluation of the regulatory environment in which the land is located and the estimated probability of obtaining the necessary approvals, the estimated time and cost it will take to obtain those approvals, and the possible concessions that will be required to be given in order to obtain them. Concessions may include cash payments to fund improvements to public places such as parks and streets, dedication of a portion of the property for use by the public or as open space, or a reduction in the density or size of the homes to be built. Based upon this review, we decide (i) as to land under contract to be purchased, whether the contract will likely be terminated or renegotiated, and (ii) as to land we own, whether the land will likely be\ndeveloped as contemplated or in an alternative manner, or should be sold. We then further determine whether costs that have been capitalized to the community are recoverable or should be written off. The write-off is charged to cost of revenues in the period in which the need for the write-off is determined.\nThe estimates used in the determination of the estimated cash flows and fair value of both current and future communities are based on factors known to us at the time such estimates are made and our expectations of future operations and economic conditions. Should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated fair value deteriorate in the future, we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges and write-offs related to current and future communities and such amounts could be material.\nWe provided for inventory impairment charges and the expensing of costs that we believed not to be recoverable in each of the three fiscal years ended October 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, as shown in the table below (amounts in thousands):\n\nThe table below provides, for the periods indicated, the number of operating communities that we reviewed for potential impairment, the number of operating communities in which we recognized impairment charges, the amount of impairment charges recognized, and, as of the end of the period indicated, the fair value of those communities, net of impairment charges\n($ amounts in thousands):\n\nIncome Taxes - Valuation Allowance\nSignificant judgment is applied in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets. In accordance with GAAP, a valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such asset will not be realized. The realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law. We assess the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets\nbased on GAAP's more-likely-than-not\u201d realization threshold criteria. In our assessment, appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is significant negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, consistency, and magnitude of current and cumulative income and losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryback or carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards being used before expiration, and tax planning alternatives.\nOur assessment of the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets includes assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect our actual tax results, and our future business results may affect the amount of our deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of our deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events.\nDue to uncertainties in the estimation process, particularly with respect to changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods (carryforward period assumptions), actual results could differ from the estimates used in our analysis. Our assumptions require significant judgment because the residential home building industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. If our results of operations are less than projected and there is insufficient objectively verifiable positive evidence to support the more-likely-than-not realization of our deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance would be required to reduce or eliminate our deferred tax assets.\nOur deferred tax assets consist principally of the recognition of losses primarily driven by accrued expenses, inventory impairments, and impairments of investments in unconsolidated entities. In accordance with GAAP, we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on our determination of whether it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. At October 31, 2016 and 2015, we determined that it was more-likely-than-not that our deferred assets would be realized for federal purposes. Accordingly, at October 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not record any valuation allowances against our federal deferred tax assets.\nWe file tax returns in the various states in which we do business. Each state has its own statutes regarding the use of tax loss carryforwards. Some of the states in which we do business do not allow for the carryforward of losses, while others allow for carryforwards for five years to 20 years.\nFor state tax purposes, due to past and projected losses in certain jurisdictions where we do not have carryback potential and/or cannot sufficiently forecast future taxable income, we recognized net cumulative valuation allowances against our state deferred tax assets at October 31, 2016 and 2015. During fiscal 2015, and 2014, due to improved actual and/or operating results, we reversed $16.3 million and $13.3 million of state deferred tax asset valuation allowances, respectively. During fiscal 2016, no state deferred tax asset valuation allowances were reversed. In addition, we establish valuation allowances for newly created deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions where it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax asset would not be realized. During fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recognized new valuation allowances of $1.0 million, $3.7 million, and $1.3 million, respectively. The valuation allowance at October 31, 2016 of $32.2 million relates to deferred tax assets in states that had not met the more-likely-than-not realization threshold criteria.\nRevenue and Cost Recognition\nRevenues and cost of revenues from home sales are recorded at the time each home is delivered and title and possession are transferred to the buyer.\nFor our standard attached and detached homes, land, land development, and related costs, both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future, are amortized to the cost of homes closed based upon the total number of homes to be constructed in each community. Any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs subsequent to the commencement of delivery of homes are allocated to the remaining undelivered homes in the community. Home construction and related costs are charged to the cost of homes closed under the specific identification method. For our master planned communities, the estimated land, common area development, and related costs, including the cost of golf courses, net of their estimated residual value, are allocated to individual communities within a master planned community on a relative sales value basis. Any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs are allocated to the remaining home sites in each of the communities of the master planned community.\nFor high-rise/mid-rise projects, land, land development, construction, and related costs, both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future, are generally amortized to the cost of units closed based upon an estimated relative sales value of the units closed to the total estimated sales value. Any changes resulting from a change in the estimated total costs or revenues of the project are allocated to the remaining units to be delivered.\nForfeited customer deposits: Forfeited customer deposits are recognized in other income-net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income in the period in which we determine that the customer will not complete the purchase of the home and we have the right to retain the deposit.\nSales Incentives: In order to promote sales of our homes, we grant our home buyers sales incentives from time to time. These incentives will vary by type of incentive and by amount on a community-by-community and home-by-home basis. Incentives that impact the value of the home or the sales price paid, such as special or additional options, are generally reflected as a reduction in sales revenues. Incentives that we pay to an outside party, such as paying some or all of a home buyer's closing costs, are recorded as an additional cost of revenues. Incentives are recognized at the time the home is delivered to the home buyer and we receive the sales proceeds.\nWarranty and Self-Insurance\nWarranty: We provide all of our home buyers with a limited warranty as to workmanship and mechanical equipment. We also provide many of our home buyers with a limited 10-year warranty as to structural integrity. We accrue for expected warranty costs at the time each home is closed and title and possession are transferred to the home buyer. Warranty costs are accrued based upon historical experience. Adjustments to our warranty liabilities related to homes delivered in prior years are recorded in the period in which a change in our estimate occurs. Over the past several", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ( MD&A\u201d)\nThis discussion and analysis is based on, should be read together with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 15(a)1 of this Form 10-K, beginning at page. It also should be read in conjunction with the disclosure under Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in Part 1 of this Form 10-K.\nWhen this report uses the words we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d and the Company,\u201d they refer to Toll Brothers, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. References herein to fiscal year refer to our fiscal years ended or ending October 31.\nUnless otherwise stated in this report, net contracts signed represents a number or value equal to the gross number or value of contracts signed during the relevant period, less the number or value of contracts canceled during the relevant period, which includes contracts that were signed during the relevant period and in prior periods. Backlog consists of homes under contract but not yet delivered to our home buyers ( backlog\u201d).\nOVERVIEW\nOur Business\nWe design, build, market, sell, and arrange financing for detached and attached homes in luxury residential communities. We cater to move-up, empty-nester, active-adult, age-qualified, and second-home buyers in the United States ( Traditional Home Building Product\u201d). We also build and sell homes in urban infill markets through Toll Brothers City Living\u00ae ( City Living\u201d). At October 31, 2016, we were operating in 19 states. In the five years ended October 31, 2016, we delivered 24,490 homes from 621 communities, including 6,098 homes from 377 communities in fiscal 2016.\nIn February 2014, we acquired the home building business of Shapell Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Shapell\u201d), and in November 2016, we acquired substantially all of the assets and operations of Coleman Real Estate Holdings, LLC ( Coleman\u201d). See Acquisitions\u201d below for more information.\nWe are developing several land parcels for master planned communities in which we intend to build homes on a portion of the lots and sell the remaining lots to other builders. Two of these master planned communities are being developed 100% by us, and the remaining communities are being developed through joint ventures with other builders or financial partners.\nIn addition to our residential for-sale business, we also develop and operate for-rent apartments through joint ventures. See the section entitled Toll Brothers Apartment Living/Toll Brothers Campus Living/Toll Brothers Realty Trust\u201d below.\nWe operate our own land development, architectural, engineering, mortgage, title, landscaping, security monitoring, lumber distribution, house component assembly, and manufacturing operations. In addition, in certain markets, we develop land for sale to other builders, often through joint venture structures with other builders or with financial partners. We also develop, own, and operate golf courses and country clubs, which generally are associated with several of our master planned communities.\nWe have investments in various unconsolidated entities. We have investments in joint ventures (i) to develop land for the joint venture participants and for sale to outside builders ( Land Development Joint Ventures\u201d); (ii) to develop for-sale homes ( Home Building Joint Ventures\u201d); (iii) to develop luxury for-rent residential apartments, commercial space and a hotel ( Rental Property Joint Ventures\u201d); and (iv) to invest in distressed loans and real estate and provide financing for residential builders and developers for the acquisition and development of land and home sites ( Gibraltar Joint Ventures\u201d).\nFinancial Highlights\nIn fiscal 2016, we recognized $5.17 billion of revenues and net income of $382.1 million, as compared to $4.17 billion of revenues and net income of $363.2 million in fiscal 2015.\nIn fiscal 2016 and 2015, the value of net contracts signed was $5.65 billion (6,719 homes) and $4.96 billion (5,910 homes), respectively. The value of our backlog at October 31, 2016 was $3.98 billion (4,685 homes), as compared to our backlog at October 31, 2015 of $3.50 billion (4,064 homes).\nAt October 31, 2016, we had $633.7 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and approximately $961.8 million for borrowing available under our $1.295 billion revolving credit facility ( New Credit Facility\u201d) that matures in May 2021. At October 31, 2016, we had $250.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the New Credit Facility and had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $83.2 million.\nAt October 31, 2016, our total equity and our debt to total capitalization ratio were $4.24 billion and 0.47 to 1:00, respectively,\nAcquisitions\nShapell Industries, Inc.\nOn February 4, 2014, we completed our acquisition of Shapell pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) dated November 6, 2013 with Shapell Investment Properties, Inc. ( SIPI\u201d). We acquired all of the equity interests in Shapell from SIPI on February 4, 2014 for $1.49 billion, net of cash acquired (the Acquisition\u201d). We acquired the single-family residential real property development business of Shapell, including a portfolio of approximately 4,950 home sites in California, some of which we have sold to other builders. The Acquisition provided us with a premier California land portfolio including 11 active selling communities, as of the Acquisition date, in affluent, high-growth markets: the San Francisco Bay area, metro Los Angeles, Orange County, and the Carlsbad market. As part of the Acquisition, we assumed contracts to deliver 126 homes with an aggregate value of approximately $105.3 million. The Shapell operations have been fully integrated into our operations.\nColeman Real Estate Holdings, LLC\nIn October 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets and operations of Coleman. In November 2016, we completed the acquisition of Coleman for approximately $85.2 million in cash. The assets acquired were primarily inventory, including approximately 1,750 home sites owned or controlled through land purchase agreements. As part of the acquisition, we assumed contracts to deliver 128 homes with an aggregate value of $38.8 million. The average price of the undelivered homes at the date of acquisition was approximately $303,000. Our selling community count increased by 15 communities at the acquisition date.\nSee Note 2, Acquisitions,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these acquisitions.\nOur Business Environment and Current Outlook\nSince the third quarter of fiscal 2014 through the end of fiscal 2016, we saw a general strengthening in customer demand. In fiscal 2016, we signed 6,719 contracts with an aggregate value of $5.65 billion, compared to 5,910 contracts with an aggregate value of $4.96 billion in fiscal 2015, and 5,271 contracts with an aggregate value of $3.90 billion in fiscal 2014. We are optimistic that the strengthening in customer demand will continue for the foreseeable future. We believe that, as the national economy continues to improve and as the millennial generation comes of age, pent-up demand for homes will continue to be released.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau ( Census Bureau\u201d), the number of households earning $100,000 or more (in constant 2015 dollars) at September 2016 stood at 33.2 million, or approximately 26.4% of all U.S. households. This group has grown at three times the rate of increase of all U.S. households since 1980. According to Harvard University's 2016 report, The State of the Nation's Housing,\u201d demographic forces are likely to drive the addition of just under 1.3 million new households per year during the next decade.\nHousing starts, which encompass the units needed for household formations, second homes, and the replacement of obsolete or demolished units, have not kept pace with this projected household growth. According to the Census Bureau's October 2016 New Residential Sales Report, new home inventory stands at a supply of just 5.2 months, based on current sales paces. If demand and pace increase significantly, the supply of 5.2 months could quickly be drawn down. During the period 1970 through 2007, total housing starts in the United States averaged approximately 1.6 million per year, while during the period 2008 through 2015, total housing starts averaged approximately 0.81 million per year according to the Census Bureau.\nWe continue to believe that many of our communities are in desirable locations that are difficult to replace and in markets where approvals have been increasingly difficult to achieve. We believe that many of these communities have substantial embedded value that may be realized in the future as the housing recovery strengthens.\nCompetitive Landscape\nThe home building business is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with numerous home builders of varying sizes, ranging from local to national in scope, some of which have greater sales and financial resources than we do. Sales of existing homes, whether by a homeowner or by a financial institution that has acquired a home through a foreclosure, also provide competition. We compete primarily on the basis of price, location, design, quality, service, and reputation. We believe our financial stability, relative to many others in our industry, is a favorable competitive factor as more home buyers focus on builder solvency.\nIn addition, there are fewer and more selective lenders serving our industry as compared to prior years and we believe that these lenders gravitate to the home building companies that offer them the greatest security, the strongest balance sheets, and the broadest array of potential business opportunities.\nLand Acquisition and Development\nOur business is subject to many risks, because of the extended length of time that it takes to obtain the necessary approvals on a property, complete the land improvements on it, and deliver a home after a home buyer signs an agreement of sale. In certain cases, we attempt to reduce some of these risks by utilizing one or more of the following methods: controlling land for future development through options (also referred to herein as land purchase contracts\u201d or option and purchase agreements\u201d), which enable us to obtain necessary governmental approvals before acquiring title to the land; generally commencing construction of a detached home only after executing an agreement of sale and receiving a substantial down payment from the buyer; and using subcontractors to perform home construction and land development work on a fixed-price basis.\nDuring fiscal 2016 and 2015, we acquired control of approximately 10,682 home sites (net of options terminated and home sites sold) and, approximately 2,611 home sites (net of options terminated and home sites sold), respectively. At October 31, 2016, we controlled approximately 48,837 home sites, as compared to approximately 44,253 home sites at October 31, 2015, and 47,167 home sites at October 31, 2014. In addition, at October 31, 2016, we expect to purchase approximately 3,600 additional home sites from several land development joint ventures in which we have an interest, at prices not yet determined.\nOf the approximately 48,837 total home sites that we owned or controlled through options at October 31, 2016, we owned approximately 34,137 and controlled approximately 14,700 through options. Of the 48,837 home sites, approximately 17,065 were substantially improved. The 14,700 home sites controlled through options includes the 1,750 home sites owned or controlled by Coleman.\nIn addition, at October 31, 2016, our Land Development Joint Ventures owned approximately 11,400 home sites (including 240 home sites included in the 14,700 controlled through options), and our Homebuilding Joint Ventures owned approximately 400 home sites.\nAt October 31, 2016, we were selling from 310 communities, compared to 288 communities at October 31, 2015, and 263 communities at October 31, 2014.\nCustomer Mortgage Financing\nWe maintain relationships with a widely diversified group of mortgage financial institutions, many of which are among the largest in the industry. We believe that regional and community banks continue to recognize the long-term value in creating relationships with high-quality, affluent customers such as our home buyers, and these banks continue to provide such customers with financing.\nWe believe that our home buyers generally are, and should continue to be, better able to secure mortgages due to their typically lower loan-to-value ratios and attractive credit profiles, as compared to the average home buyer.\nToll Brothers Apartment Living/Toll Brothers Campus Living/Toll Brothers Realty Trust\nIn addition to our residential for-sale business, we also develop and operate for-rent apartments through joint ventures. At October 31, 2016, we controlled 28 land parcels as for-rent apartment projects containing approximately 9,600 units. These projects, which are located in the metro Boston to metro Washington, D.C. corridor; Atlanta, Georgia; Dallas, Texas; and Fremont, California are being operated, are being developed or will be developed with partners under the brand names Toll Brothers Apartment Living, Toll Brothers Campus Living and Toll Brothers Realty Trust (the Trust\u201d).\nAt October 31, 2016, we had approximately 2,950 units in for-rent apartment projects that were occupied or ready for occupancy, 600 units in the lease-up stage, 900 units under active development, and 5,150 units in the planning stage. Of the 9,600 units at October 31, 2016, 4,850 were owned by joint ventures in which we have an interest; approximately 1,600 were owned by us; 2,850 were under contract to be purchased by us; and 300 were under a letter of intent.\nCONTRACTS AND BACKLOG\nThe aggregate value of net sales contracts signed increased 14.0% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, and 27.2% in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. The value of net sales contracts signed was $5.65 billion (6,719 homes) in fiscal 2016, $4.96 billion (5,910 homes) in fiscal 2015, and $3.90 billion (5,271 homes) in fiscal 2014.\nThe increase in the aggregate value of net contracts signed in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was the result of a 13.7% increase in the number of net contracts signed. The increase in the number of net contracts signed in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was primarily due to the continued recovery in the U.S. housing market in fiscal 2016.\nThe value of our backlog at October 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $3.98 billion (4,685 homes), $3.50 billion (4,064 homes), and $2.72 billion (3,679 homes), respectively. Approximately 97% of the homes in backlog at October 31, 2016 are expected to be delivered by October 31, 2017. The 13.7% increase in the value of homes in backlog at October 31, 2016, as compared to October 31, 2015, was primarily due to a 14.0% increase in the value of net contracts signed in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, and the higher backlog at the beginning of fiscal 2016, as compared to the beginning of fiscal 2015, offset, in part, by a 23.9% increase in the aggregate value of our deliveries in fiscal 2016, as compared to the aggregate value of deliveries in fiscal 2015.\nThe 28.8% increase in the value of homes in backlog at October 31, 2015, as compared to October 31, 2014, was due to a 27.2% increase in the value of net contracts signed in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, and the higher backlog at the beginning of fiscal 2015, as compared to the beginning of fiscal 2014, offset, in part, by a 6.6% increase in the aggregate value of our deliveries in fiscal 2015, as compared to the aggregate value of deliveries in fiscal 2014.\nFor more information regarding revenues, net contracts signed, and backlog by geographic segment, see Segments\u201d in this MD&A.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nInventory\nInventory is stated at cost unless an impairment exists, in which case it is written down to fair value in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). In addition to direct land acquisition, land development, and home construction costs, costs also include interest, real estate taxes, and direct overhead related to development and construction, which are capitalized to inventory during periods beginning with the commencement of development and ending with the completion of construction. For those communities that have been temporarily closed, no additional capitalized interest is allocated to the community's inventory until it reopens, and other carrying costs are expensed as incurred. Once a parcel of land has been approved for development and we open the community, it can typically take four or more years to fully develop, sell, and deliver all the homes in that community. Longer or shorter time periods are possible depending on the number of home sites in a community and the sales and delivery pace of the homes in a community. Our master planned communities, consisting of several smaller communities, may take up to 10 years or more to complete. Because our inventory is considered a long-lived asset under GAAP, we are required to regularly review the carrying value of each of our communities and write down the value of those communities when we believe the values are not recoverable.\nOperating Communities: When the profitability of an operating community deteriorates, the sales pace declines significantly, or some other factor indicates a possible impairment in the recoverability of the asset, the asset is reviewed for impairment by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flow for the community to its carrying value. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flow is less than the community's carrying value, the carrying value is written down to its estimated fair value. Estimated fair value is primarily determined by discounting the estimated future cash flow of each community. The impairment is charged to cost of revenues in the period in which the impairment is determined. In estimating the future undiscounted cash flow of a community, we use various estimates such as (i) the expected sales pace in a community, based upon general economic conditions that will have a short-term or long-term impact on the market in which the community is located and on competition within the market, including the number of home sites available and pricing and incentives being offered in other communities owned by us or by other builders; (ii) the expected sales prices and sales incentives to be offered in a community; (iii) costs expended to date and expected to be incurred in the future, including, but not limited to, land and land development costs, home construction, interest, and overhead costs; (iv) alternative product offerings that may be offered in a community that will have an impact on sales pace, sales price, building cost, or the number of homes that can be built in a particular community; and (v) alternative uses for the property, such as the possibility of a sale of the entire community to another builder or the sale of individual home sites.\nFuture Communities: We evaluate all land held for future communities or future sections of operating communities, whether owned or optioned, to determine whether or not we expect to proceed with the development of the land as originally contemplated. This evaluation encompasses the same types of estimates used for operating communities described above, as well as an evaluation of the regulatory environment in which the land is located and the estimated probability of obtaining the necessary approvals, the estimated time and cost it will take to obtain those approvals, and the possible concessions that will be required to be given in order to obtain them. Concessions may include cash payments to fund improvements to public places such as parks and streets, dedication of a portion of the property for use by the public or as open space, or a reduction in the density or size of the homes to be built. Based upon this review, we decide (i) as to land under contract to be purchased, whether the contract will likely be terminated or renegotiated, and (ii) as to land we own, whether the land will likely be\ndeveloped as contemplated or in an alternative manner, or should be sold. We then further determine whether costs that have been capitalized to the community are recoverable or should be written off. The write-off is charged to cost of revenues in the period in which the need for the write-off is determined.\nThe estimates used in the determination of the estimated cash flows and fair value of both current and future communities are based on factors known to us at the time such estimates are made and our expectations of future operations and economic conditions. Should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated fair value deteriorate in the future, we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges and write-offs related to current and future communities and such amounts could be material.\nWe provided for inventory impairment charges and the expensing of costs that we believed not to be recoverable in each of the three fiscal years ended October 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, as shown in the table below (amounts in thousands):\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

In accordance with GAAP, a valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such asset will not be realized. The realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law. We assess the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets\nbased on GAAP's more-likely-than-not\u201d realization threshold criteria. In our assessment, appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is significant negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, consistency, and magnitude of current and cumulative income and losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryback or carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards being used before expiration, and tax planning alternatives.\nOur assessment of the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets includes assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect our actual tax results, and our future business results may affect the amount of our deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of our deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events.\nDue to uncertainties in the estimation process, particularly with respect to changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods (carryforward period assumptions), actual results could differ from the estimates used in our analysis. Our assumptions require significant judgment because the residential home building industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. If our results of operations are less than projected and there is insufficient objectively verifiable positive evidence to support the more-likely-than-not realization of our deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance would be required to reduce or eliminate our deferred tax assets.\nOur deferred tax assets consist principally of the recognition of losses primarily driven by accrued expenses, inventory impairments, and impairments of investments in unconsolidated entities. In accordance with GAAP, we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on our determination of whether it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. At October 31, 2016 and 2015, we determined that it was more-likely-than-not that our deferred assets would be realized for federal purposes. Accordingly, at October 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not record any valuation allowances against our federal deferred tax assets.\nWe file tax returns in the various states in which we do business. Each state has its own statutes regarding the use of tax loss carryforwards. Some of the states in which we do business do not allow for the carryforward of losses, while others allow for carryforwards for five years to 20 years.\nFor state tax purposes, due to past and projected losses in certain jurisdictions where we do not have carryback potential and/or cannot sufficiently forecast future taxable income, we recognized net cumulative valuation allowances against our state deferred tax assets at October 31, 2016 and 2015. During fiscal 2015, and 2014, due to improved actual and/or operating results, we reversed $16.3 million and $13.3 million of state deferred tax asset valuation allowances, respectively. During fiscal 2016, no state deferred tax asset valuation allowances were reversed. In addition, we establish valuation allowances for newly created deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions where it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax asset would not be realized. During fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recognized new valuation allowances of $1.0 million, $3.7 million, and $1.3 million, respectively. The valuation allowance at October 31, 2016 of $32.2 million relates to deferred tax assets in states that had not met the more-likely-than-not realization threshold criteria.\nRevenue and Cost Recognition\nRevenues and cost of revenues from home sales are recorded at the time each home is delivered and title and possession are transferred to the buyer.\nFor our standard attached and detached homes, land, land development, and related costs, both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future, are amortized to the cost of homes closed based upon the total number of homes to be constructed in each community. Any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs subsequent to the commencement of delivery of homes are allocated to the remaining undelivered homes in the community. Home construction and related costs are charged to the cost of homes closed under the specific identification method. For our master planned communities, the estimated land, common area development, and related costs, including the cost of golf courses, net of their estimated residual value, are allocated to individual communities within a master planned community on a relative sales value basis. Any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs are allocated to the remaining home sites in each of the communities of the master planned community.\nFor high-rise/mid-rise projects, land, land development, construction, and related costs, both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future, are generally amortized to the cost of units closed based upon an estimated relative sales value of the units closed to the total estimated sales value. Any changes resulting from a change in the estimated total costs or revenues of the project are allocated to the remaining units to be delivered.\nForfeited customer deposits: Forfeited customer deposits are recognized in other income-net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income in the period in which we determine that the customer will not complete the purchase of the home and we have the right to retain the deposit.\nSales Incentives: In order to promote sales of our homes, we grant our home buyers sales incentives from time to time. These incentives will vary by type of incentive and by amount on a community-by-community and home-by-home basis. Incentives that impact the value of the home or the sales price paid, such as special or additional options, are generally reflected as a reduction in sales revenues. Incentives that we pay to an outside party, such as paying some or all of a home buyer's closing costs, are recorded as an additional cost of revenues. Incentives are recognized at the time the home is delivered to the home buyer and we receive the sales proceeds.\nWarranty and Self-Insurance\nWarranty: We provide all of our home buyers with a limited warranty as to workmanship and mechanical equipment. We also provide many of our home buyers with a limited 10-year warranty as to structural integrity. We accrue for expected warranty costs at the time each home is closed and title and possession are transferred to the home buyer. Warranty costs are accrued based upon historical experience. Adjustments to our warranty liabilities related to homes delivered in prior years are recorded in the period in which a change in our estimate occurs. Over the past several"}
