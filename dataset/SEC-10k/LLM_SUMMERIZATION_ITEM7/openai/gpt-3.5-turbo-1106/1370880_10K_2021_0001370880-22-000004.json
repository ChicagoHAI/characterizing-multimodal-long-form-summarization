Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion focuses on our 2021 and 2020 financial condition and results of operations, including comparisons of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. For discussion and analysis related to our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2019, including comparisons of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2020, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2021.\nIn addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those under Risk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe provide a broad portfolio of cybersecurity solutions and services that allow organizations to prepare for, prevent, respond to, investigate and remediate cyber-attacks. Our portfolio includes threat intelligence, security validation, attack surface management and automated alert investigation integrated in the Mandiant Advantage platform, managed services and consulting services.\nOn October 8, 2021, we completed the previously announced sale of the FireEye Products business to Magenta Buyer LLC (\"Trellix\"), which is backed by a consortium led by Symphony Technology Group, in exchange for total cash consideration of $1.2 billion, subject to certain purchase price adjustments, and assumption of certain liabilities of the FireEye Products business as specified in the Purchase Agreement, as amended by an Amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement entered into on October 8, 2021. As a result, all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements and other portions of this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been conformed to present the FireEye Products business as discontinued operations and the related assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale for all comparative periods presented.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic. The pandemic has impacted, and could further impact, our operations and the operations of our customers as a result of quarantines, various local, state and federal government public health orders, facility and business closures, supply chain shortages, vaccination mandates, and travel and logistics restrictions. With our COVID-19 safety plans, work-from-home and return-to-office policies and restricted employee travel to essential, business-critical trips, we were able to maintain strong customer relationships and deliver our technology-enabled managed and professional services to customers without interruption. As a result, we did not incur significant disruptions to our operations during the year ended December 31, 2021 due to the pandemic.\nIn January 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA\u201d) Emergency Temporary Standard (the ETS\u201d) requiring that all employers with at least 100 employees ensure that their U.S. employees are fully vaccinated for COVID-19. Following that ruling, OSHA chose to withdraw the vaccine ETS altogether. In addition, the federal district court in Georgia stayed the enforcement of the mandatory employee COVID-19 vaccination requirement found in President Biden's Executive Order for U.S. government contractors and their subcontractors (the Executive Order\u201d). As a result, we revised our COVID-19 policy to only require COVID-19 vaccination for employees or visitors that will be entering any of Mandiant's U.S. office locations. We are also complying with the other aspects of the Executive Order for federal government contractors at our covered contractor workplaces that have not been stayed by the federal courts. Our implementation and enforcement of vaccination requirements could be difficult, costly, and potentially result in employee attrition, including attrition of key employees, disruptions in workforce performance, and difficulty securing future labor needs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe anticipate governments and businesses may take additional actions or extend existing actions to respond to the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to actively monitor the impacts and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in all aspects of our business. Although we are unable to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including any recurrence of the virus or its variants, on our business, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources at this time, we expect we may be negatively affected if the pandemic and related public health measures further result in substantial manufacturing or supply chain problems, disruptions in local and global economies, volatility in the global financial markets, overall reductions in demand, delays in payment, or other ramifications from the COVID-19 pandemic. For a further discussion of the uncertainties and business risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, see the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Business Model\nWe generate revenue from Mandiant Solutions. Pursuant to our agreement to sell the FireEye Products business to a consortium led by STG, the revenue from FireEye Products has been included within discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. We disaggregate our revenue from Mandiant Solutions into two main categories: (i) platform,\ncloud subscription and managed services and (ii) professional services. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 49%, 50% and 49%, respectively. Revenue from professional services was 51%, 50% and 51% of total revenue for December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nPlatform, cloud subscription and managed services\nThe majority of our platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue is generated from sales of subscriptions to our Mandiant Advantage platform and modules (including Security Validation, Threat Intelligence and Automated Defense and Attack Surface Management) and managed services that are delivered through the cloud. A majority of the revenue in this category is recognized ratably over the contractual term, generally one to three years.\nWhile our threat intelligence and automated defense modules are only available through the cloud, a portion of our revenue in the platform, cloud subscription and managed services category is derived from term licenses of our Security Validation module deployed on premise, and revenue from these sales is recognized when the license key is issued to the customer. Revenue from the sale of our on-premise Security Validation term licenses continues to decline as we encourage our new and existing customers to migrate their solution to the cloud-based Mandiant Advantage platform for greater flexibility and integration with our Threat Intelligence Attack Surface Management and Automated Defense modules. An increasing number of new Security Validation customers are purchasing subscriptions for the cloud-based Mandiant Advantage Security Validation module, and we expect an increasing number of Security Validation customers to renew on the cloud-based Mandiant Advantage module. Deferred revenue from our platform, cloud subscription and managed services totaled $271.0 million and $182.8 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nProfessional Services\nIn addition to our platform, cloud subscription and managed services, we offer professional services, including incident response and other strategic security consulting services, to our customers who have experienced a cybersecurity breach or desire assistance assessing and increasing the resilience of their IT environments to cyber-attack. The majority our professional services are offered on a time and materials basis, through a fixed fee arrangement, or on a retainer basis. Revenue from professional services is recognized as services are delivered. Revenue from our Expertise On Demand subscription and some pre-paid professional services is deferred, and revenue is recognized when services are delivered. Deferred revenue from professional services as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $139.3 million and $101.5 million, respectively.\nDiscontinued Operations\nRevenue from discontinued operations was generated primarily from sales of network, email, endpoint security, Helix SIEM and Cloudvisory solutions deployed on a customer's premises, either as an integrated security appliance or a distributed hybrid on-premise/private cloud configurations. As a single performance obligation, revenue from sales of appliance hardware and related subscriptions was recognized ratably over the contractual term, typically one to three years. Such contracts typically contained a material right of renewal option that allows the customer to renew their Dynamic Threat Intelligence (\"DTI\") cloud and support subscriptions for an additional term at a discount to the original purchase price of the single performance obligation. For contracts that contained a material right of renewal option, the value of the performance obligation allocated to the renewal was recognized ratably over the period between the end of the initial contractual term and end of the estimated useful life of the related appliance and license. A small portion of our revenue in the product and related subscription and support revenue related to discontinued operations was derived from the sale of our network forensics appliances and our central management system appliances. These appliances were not dependent on regular security intelligence updates, and revenue from these appliances was therefore recognized when ownership was transferred to our customer, typically at shipment.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe monitor our key business metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We discuss revenue and gross margin below under Components of Operating Results.\u201d Deferred revenue, annualized recurring revenue, billings (a non-GAAP metric), net cash flow used in operating activities, and free cash flow (a non-GAAP metric) are discussed immediately below the following table (in thousands, except percentages).\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended or as of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>235,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>198,695 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>163,583 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services revenue\n</td> <td>248,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>201,014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>167,787 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>483,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>399,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>331,370 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year-over-year percentage increase\n</td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>47 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred revenue (current and non-current)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>410,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>284,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>273,241 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized recurring revenue\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>278,819 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>226,451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>196,014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billings (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>609,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>408,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>369,879 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities - continuing operations\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(62,389) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(100,409) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(120,786) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities - discontinued operations\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>195,304 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>188,323 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,537 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow (non-GAAP) (continuing operations)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(87,925) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(118,337) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(150,135) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeferred revenue. Our deferred revenue consists of amounts that we have the right to invoice but have not yet been recognized into revenue as of the end of the respective period. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods. The majority of our deferred revenue consists of the unamortized balance of deferred revenue from previously invoiced sales of our security validation platforms, threat intelligence, consulting services and managed detection and response services and excludes deferred revenue from discontinued operations included in liabilities held for sale. Invoiced amounts for such contracts can be for multiple years, and we classify our deferred revenue as current or non-current depending on when we expect to recognize the related revenue. If the deferred revenue is expected to be recognized within 12 months it is classified as current, otherwise, the deferred revenue is classified as non-current. A table for our deferred revenue is provided below (in thousands):\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred revenue, current\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>307,611 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>226,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred revenue, non-current\n</td> <td>102,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,897 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deferred revenue\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>410,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>284,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnnualized recurring revenue. Annualized recurring revenue (\"ARR\") is an operating metric and represents the annualized revenue run-rate of active term licenses, subscriptions, managed services and support contracts at the end of a reporting period. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as ARR is an operating metric and is not intended to be combined with or replace revenue or deferred revenue. ARR is not a forecast of future revenue, which can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates, and does not include revenue from consumption-based contracts or professional services except for service level agreement payments. We consider ARR a useful measure of the value of the recurring components of our business because it reflects both our ability to attract new customers for our solutions and our success at retaining and expanding our relationships with existing customers. Further, ARR is not impacted by variations in contract length, enabling more meaningful comparison to prior periods as we align our invoicing practices to growing customer preference for annual billing on multi-year contracts. We started including ARR from service level agreement payments in our ARR calculation starting in 2020 once they became material. ARR calculations for 2019 have been updated for comparative purposes. A table for our ARR is provided below (in thousands): Table 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Platform, cloud subscription and managed services\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>268,662 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>219,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>191,477 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services\n</td> <td>10,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,641 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,537 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total annualized recurring revenue\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>278,819 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>226,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>196,014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBillings. Billings are a non-GAAP financial metric that we define as revenue recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period, excluding deferred revenue assumed through acquisitions. We monitor billings as a supplement to revenue (the corresponding GAAP measure), because billings impact our deferred revenue, which is an important indicator of the health and visibility of trends in our business and represents a significant percentage of future revenue. However, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may define billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure. Additionally, the calculated billings metric represents the total contract value we have the right to invoice, which includes multi-year subscriptions to our solutions as well as commitments for future service engagements. Calculated billings are impacted by changes in average contract length, thereby reducing the usefulness of comparisons to prior periods. Unlike subscription revenue, which is recognized ratably over a contract term, services revenue is recognized when services are delivered, making calculated services billings less useful as a measure of current business activity.\nA reconciliation of billings to revenue, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below (in thousands):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>483,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>399,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>331,370 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Deferred revenue, end of period </td> <td>410,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>284,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>273,241 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Deferred revenue, beginning of period </td> <td>(284,253) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(273,241) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(231,982) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Deferred revenue assumed through acquisitions </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,664) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,750) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billings (non-GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>609,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>408,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>369,879 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have provided disaggregation of billings below (in thousands):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Platform, cloud subscription and managed services </td> <td>$ </td> <td>323,319 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>195,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>175,870 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services </td> <td>286,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>212,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>194,009 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billings (non-GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>609,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>408,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>369,879 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations. We monitor net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. Our net cash provided by operating activities performance is driven in large part by sales of our offerings in the platform, cloud subscription, managed services category and professional services and from up-front payments for both subscriptions and services. Monitoring net cash used in operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items, such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation costs, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business.\nFree cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure we define as net cash used in operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, less purchases of property and equipment. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that, after the purchases of property and equipment, can be used by us for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, debt repayment, strengthening our balance sheet and share repurchases. However, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow differently, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flow used in operating activities is provided below (in thousands):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities - continuing operations\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(62,389) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(100,409) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(120,786) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: purchase of property and equipment\n</td> <td>(25,536) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,928) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29,349) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow (non-GAAP) - continuing operations\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(87,925) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(118,337) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(150,135) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities - continuing operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>705,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(22,291) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(105,276) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities - continuing operations\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(273,393) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>319,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,273 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors Affecting our Performance\nMarket Adoption. We rely on market education to raise awareness of today's cyber-attacks and articulate the need for our solutions and services. Although our security validation and automated defense solutions address significant challenges experienced by customers when implementing effective cybersecurity safeguards - challenges that include an expanding attack surface from remote workers and digital transformation, proliferation of nation state-sponsored attackers, and an acute shortage of cybersecurity talent - the markets for these solutions are in the early stages of development. As a result, our prospective customers may not have a specific portion of their IT budgets allocated for our advanced security solutions.\nWe invest heavily in sales and marketing efforts to increase market awareness, educate prospective customers and drive adoption of our solutions and services. Additionally, our consultants use our technology in their engagements, allowing customers to witness the features and capabilities of their IT environments. This market education is critical to creating new IT budget dollars or allocating more of existing IT budget dollars to cybersecurity in general and specifically our security validation and security automation solutions. The degree to which prospective customers recognize the mission critical need for our solutions will drive our ability to acquire new customers and increase renewals and follow-on sales opportunities, which, in turn, will affect our future financial performance.\nSales Productivity. Our sales organization consists of in-house sales teams who work in collaboration with external channel partners to identify new sales prospects, sell additional products, subscriptions and services, and provide post-sale support. Our direct sales teams are organized by territory to target large enterprise and government customers who typically have sales cycles that can last several months or more. We have also expanded our inside sales teams to work with channel partners to expand our customer base of small and medium enterprises, or SMEs, as well as manage renewals of subscription and support contracts.\nNewly hired sales and marketing employees typically require several months to establish prospect relationships and achieve full sales productivity. In addition, although we believe our investments in market education have increased awareness of us and our solutions globally, sales teams in certain international markets may face local markets with limited awareness of us and our solutions, or have customer-specific requirements that are not available with our solutions. These factors will influence the timing and overall levels of sales productivity, impacting the rate at which we will be able to convert prospects to sales and drive revenue growth.\nCustomer Acquisition and Retention. Since we expect that our existing customers are likely to expand their deployments and purchase additional solutions from us over time, we believe new customer acquisition and retention thereafter of existing customers is essential to expanding the value of our installed base, which we monitor through our key business metrics, including annualized recurring revenue. We believe our ability to maintain strong customer retention and drive new customer acquisition will have a material impact on future sales of our security solutions and services and therefore our future financial performance.\nFollow-On Sales. To grow our revenue, it is important that our customers make additional purchases of our solutions and services. After the initial sale to a new customer, we focus on expanding our relationship with the customer to sell additional modules available on the Mandiant Advantage platform as well as add additional services. Sales to our existing customer base can take the form of incremental sales of our solutions, managed services, and consulting services either to expand their deployment of our technologies, to extend their internal security resources with our managed and professional security services, or to continuously measure the effectiveness of their security controls. Our opportunity to expand our customer relationships through follow-on sales will increase as we demonstrate the utility of our solutions, broaden our security solutions portfolio with additional subscriptions and services and enhance the functionality of our existing solutions. Follow-on sales lead to increased revenue over the lifecycle of a customer relationship and can significantly increase the return on our sales and marketing investments. With many of our large enterprise and government customers, we have realized follow-on sales that were multiples of the value of their initial purchases.\nComponents of Operating Results\nAs a result of the sale of the FireEye Products business, all periods presented in this Form 10-K have been conformed to present the FireEye Products business as discontinued operations. We report the financial results of discontinued operations separately from continuing operations to distinguish the financial impact of disposal transactions from ongoing operations. The results of operations and cash flows of a discontinued operation are restated for all comparative periods presented. Refer to Note 2, Discontinued Operations,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from the sales of our Mandiant solutions and services. Revenue is recognized when a contract has been entered into with a customer, the performance obligation(s) is (are) identified, the transaction price is determined and has been\nallocated to the performance obligation(s) and only then for each performance obligation after we have satisfied that performance obligation.\n\u2022Platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue. The majority of our platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue is generated from sales of subscriptions to our Mandiant Advantage platform and modules (security validation, threat intelligence, and automated defense) and to our managed services that are delivered through the cloud and is recognized over the term of the contract. A small portion of our revenue in the platform, cloud subscription and managed services category is derived from sales of on premise term licenses to our security validation platform, and revenue from these sales is recognized when the license key is issued to the customer.\n\u2022Consulting services revenue. Consulting services, which includes incident response, security assessments, and other strategic security consulting services, are offered on a time-and-material basis, through a fixed fee arrangement, or on a retainer basis. We recognize the associated revenue as the services are delivered. Some consulting services and our expertise-on-demand subscription are prepaid, and revenue is deferred until services are delivered.\nCost of Revenue\nOur total cost of revenue consists of cost of cloud and managed service revenue and cost of consulting services revenue.\n\u2022Cost of platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue. Cost of platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue primarily consists of personnel costs associated with maintaining our threat intelligence and delivering our managed services, hosting costs paid to third party cloud platform providers, and allocated overhead costs. Personnel costs associated with maintaining our threat intelligence and delivering our managed services consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. Overhead costs consist of certain facilities, depreciation and information technology costs. If revenue from sales of our cloud and managed services declines, the cost of platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue may increase as a percentage of cloud and managed services revenue due to the fixed nature of a portion of these costs.\n\u2022Cost of consulting services revenue. Cost of consulting services revenue primarily consists of personnel costs for our services organization and allocated overhead costs. If sales of our consulting services decline or we are unable to maintain our chargeability or billing rates, our cost of consulting services revenue may increase as a percentage of consulting services revenue.\nGross Margin\nGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the mix between platform, cloud subscription and managed services and professional services revenue, the mix of incident response and other strategic security consulting, and the amount of reimbursable travel expenses. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate slightly depending on these factors, but increase over time with expected growth and higher mix of platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue compared to professional services revenue.\nAlthough FireEye products revenue is included in discontinued operations, indirect overhead costs are not allocated to the discontinued operations as they are not direct costs of the FireEye Product business, resulting in a decrease in gross margins.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation and, with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs consisting of certain facilities, depreciation and information technology costs.\nOperating expenses for continuing operations include the full cost of resources shared by Mandiant solutions and FireEye Products. Following the completion of the divestiture, we are being reimbursed for the cost of shared resources associated with supporting the FireEye Products business under the Transition Services Agreement (\"TSA\").\n\u2022Research and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs and allocated overhead. Research and development expense also includes certain costs associated with delivering our threat intelligence through our Mandiant Advantage platform that were included in cost of goods sold before the Mandiant Advantage platform became generally available. We expect research and development expense to increase in terms of absolute dollars and decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenue.\n\u2022Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, incentive commission costs and allocated overhead. Commission costs are capitalized and amortized over the expected period of benefit, taking into consideration the pattern of transfer to which the asset relates and the expected renewal period. When commissions paid for initial contracts are higher than those paid for renewal contracts, the initial commissions are not commensurate and as such, are recognized over the expected period of benefit, which we generally estimate to be three years. Renewal commissions are generally amortized over the renewal period.\nSales and marketing expense also includes costs for market development programs, promotional and other marketing activities, travel, and outside consulting costs. These costs are recognized as incurred. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars and remain relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue.\n\u2022General and administrative. General and administrative expense consists of personnel costs, professional service costs and allocated overhead. General and administrative personnel include our executive, finance, human resources, facilities and legal organizations. Professional service costs consist primarily of legal, auditing, accounting and other consulting costs. We expect general and administrative expense to decrease in terms of absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of total revenue after the divestiture of FireEye Product business and the cost of shared resources associated with FireEye Product business is reimbursed under the TSA.\n\u2022Restructuring Charges. In the fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we implemented restructuring plans designed to align our resources with the strategic initiatives of the business. These restructuring plans resulted in a reduction of our total workforce as well as the exiting and downsizing of certain real estate facilities, including the decommissioning of our Milpitas, California office space and relocation of our corporate headquarters to Reston, Virginia, and the impairment of certain assets. The expenses incurred primarily consisted of employee severance charges and other termination benefits, as well as real estate and related fixed asset charges for the consolidation or exiting of certain leased facilities.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalent and investment balances. We have historically invested our cash in money-market funds and other short-term, high quality securities. We expect interest income to vary each reporting period depending on our average cash and cash equivalent and investment balances during the respective reporting periods, types and mix of investments and market interest rates.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest at the stated rate (coupon) and amortization of discounts and issuance costs relating to our convertible notes. We expect interest expense to decrease as a result of the expected repurchase of our Series B Notes in June of 2022 as well as due to the adoption of ASU No. 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity in 2022 as described in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net includes gains or losses from the sale of discontinued operations, gains or losses on the disposal of fixed assets, gains or losses from our equity-method investment, gains or losses on the extinguishment of convertible notes, foreign currency re-measurement gains and losses and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. We expect other income (expense), net to fluctuate primarily as a result of foreign exchange rate movements.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes relates primarily to income taxes payable in foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business, withholding taxes, and state income taxes in the United States. The provision is offset by tax benefits primarily related to the reversal of valuation allowances previously established against our deferred tax assets. Should the tax benefits exceed the provision, then a net tax benefit from income taxes is reflected for the period. Income in certain countries may be taxed at statutory tax rates that are lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. As a result, our overall effective tax rate over the long-term may be lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate due to net income being subject to foreign income tax rates that are lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate.\nNet Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations\nAs more fully described in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, on October 8, 2021, we completed the sale of FireEye Products business and received approximately $1.2 billion in cash. As a result, the historical results of operations for the FireEye Products business have been included within discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods.

subscription and managed services revenue increased by $36.4 million, or 18%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.

The increase in cost of platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue was primarily due to an increase of $9.0 million in payroll costs due to an increase in headcount, an increase of $3.2 million pertaining to hosting services, an increase of $3.0 million in stock-based compensation expense and an increase of $2.5 million\nin amortization of intangibles, partially offset by a $13.7 million decrease in shared services, such as facility and IT support costs from our restructuring and cost optimization plans.\nThe cost of professional services revenue increased by $24.8 million, or 21%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in professional services revenue was primarily due to an increase of $20.5 million in employee costs due to an increase in headcount, an increase of $7.2 million in stock-based compensation expense and an increase of $1.5 million in consulting and temporary staffing, partially offset by a $5.7 million decrease in shared services.\nGross profit margin increased by 3% as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Platform, cloud subscription and managed services gross profit margin increased by 8% compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to continued efforts to reduce overhead expenses as well as changing the method of delivery of intelligence and reports to be at scale rather than individualized customer delivery. Professional services gross margin increased 2% compared to the same period in 2020.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development </td> <td>$ </td> <td>166,893 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>122,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing </td> <td>262,643 </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>224,357 </td> <td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>121,134 </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106,347 </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring </td> <td>34,576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>585,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>473,833 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>111,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Includes stock-based compensation expense of: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing </td> <td>42,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>34,676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,176 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85,861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense increased $44.8 million, or 37%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due an increase of $14.7 million in shared services, such as facility and IT support costs, a $12.6 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, a $12.0 million increase in employee costs due to an increase in headcount and bonuses and a $1.8 million increase in hosting services, partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in the amount of costs capitalized for internally developed software.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense increased by $38.3 million, or 17%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $14.3 million increase in commission costs and employee costs due to an increase in headcount, a $14.1 million increase in marketing programs, an increase of $5.7 million in stock-based compensation expense, a $2.9 million increase in shared services and a $2.0 million increase in consulting and professional services, partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in various other expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $14.8 million, or 14%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $9.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, a $7.3 million increase in professional services, consulting and temporary staffing costs and a $2.5 million increase in employee costs, partially offset by $3.9 million of decreases in various other expenses and a $0.6 million decrease in shared services.\nRestructuring Charges\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred restructuring charges of approximately $34.6 million, which includes $6.6 million of cash charges primarily consisting of $6.9 million in provision for restructuring charges and $0.3 million in other adjustments. In addition, there are non-cash charges of $27.7 million related to fixed asset and right-of-use asset write-offs and stock-\nbased compensation. These charges primarily related to the decommissioning of our Milpitas, California office space and relocation of our corporate headquarters to Reston, Virginia.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred restructuring charges of approximately $21.1 million, which primarily related to employee severance charges and other termination benefits as well as certain facilities exit costs for other outside services under our 2020 restructuring plans.\nInterest Income\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,906) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a lower rate of return on balances in our cash and cash equivalents and investments, which was a direct result of the overall lower interest rate environment and our limited duration investment portfolio.\nInterest Expense\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(59,333) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(60,066) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>733 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the repurchase of a portion of our convertible notes in June 2020.\nOther Expense, Net\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>1,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(496) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,874 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>378 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther income (expense), net, for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased primarily due to the gain from the sale of the FireEye Products business and subsequent billing of services under the TSA.

The increase in the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to higher foreign taxes and decreased tax benefits from business combinations as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to cumulative losses, we maintain a full valuation allowance on all of our U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets. The tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily comprised of income taxes in foreign jurisdictions and withholding taxes.\nDiscontinued Operations\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,328,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>142,037 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,186,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>835 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn October 8, 2021, we completed the sale of FireEye Products business and received approximately $1.2 billion in cash. As a result, the historical results of operations for the FireEye Products business have been included within discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nNet income from discontinued operations increased during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $1.2 billion increase in income due to the gain on the divestiture of the FireEye Products business and an $83.5 million decrease in expenses, partially offset by a $131.2 million decrease in revenue.\nNet income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a $1.2 billion gain from the sale of the FireEye Products business, net of tax and transaction cost.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 have been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited annual financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and include, in our opinion, all normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the financial information contained in those statements.

presented, reflecting increased amortization of revenue from higher deferred revenue compared with the year-ago period, as well as increased capacity in professional services. The increase in deferred revenue was due to increased sales of our cloud-based security solutions, as well as our threat intelligence and managed detection and response services.\nSequentially, our platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue continued to increase each quarter presented with the exception of the second quarter of 2021 where there was a large mix shift in our Validation business, moving from term revenue (upfront revenue) to more cloud-based revenue (deferred revenue). The overall trend in sequential growth was due to increased amortization of deferred revenue associated with higher deferred revenue, which was primarily due to growth in sales of cloud-based security solutions, threat intelligence, and managed detection and response services, as well as increased professional services revenue.\nQuarterly Gross Profit Trends\nConsistent with increases in our quarterly revenue, quarterly gross profit increased year-over-year for all periods presented. Gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, increased year-over-year in 2021, with the exception of the second quarter of 2021, which decreased year-over-year due to the large shift in revenue mix and increased spending in professional services. The overall trend in increased gross profit is primarily due to continued efforts to reduce overhead expense as well as changing the method of delivery of intelligence and reports to be at scale rather than individualized customer delivery.\nQuarterly Expense Trends\nFor 2021, operating expenses excluding restructuring charges were lowest in the first quarter and trended upward sequentially as employee-related payroll costs increased as headcount increased. For 2020, operating expenses excluding restructuring charges were\nhighest in the first quarter primarily due to our annual sales and marketing corporate event, held on-site prior to COVID-19 restrictions, decreased in the second quarter and trended up sequentially primarily due to employee-related payroll costs as headcount increased.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,154,458 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>673,234 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,039,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>624,824 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in operating activities - continuing operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(62,389) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(100,409) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(120,786) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities - discontinued operations </td> <td>124,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>195,304 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>188,323 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>61,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,537 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in) investing activities - continuing operations </td> <td>705,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,291) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(105,276) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities - discontinued operations </td> <td>(16,311) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49,867) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(63,760) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in) investing activities </td> <td>689,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(72,158) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(169,036) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in) financing activities </td> <td>(273,393) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>319,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,273 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>478,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>341,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(75,226) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion were held for working capital, capital expenditures, investment in technology, debt servicing and business acquisition purposes, of which approximately $73.3 million was held outside of the United States. We consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021 to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our plan for reinvestment of our foreign subsidiaries' undistributed earnings.\nOn August 4, 2021, we announced the acquisition of Intrigue, a developer of attack surface management technology, for consideration of approximately $12.3 million in cash.\nIn December 2020, we issued and sold 400,000 shares of a newly designated 4.5% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at a price of $1,000 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $400.0 million.\nIn November 2020, we acquired Respond Software, a cybersecurity investigation automation company. In connection with this acquisition, we paid cash consideration of $116.1 million and assumed $5.0 million in net tangible liabilities.\nIn January 2020, we acquired Cloudvisory, a provider of cloud visibility and control solutions. Total consideration for the acquisition was $13.2 million in cash. We also assumed $0.3 million in net tangible liabilities.\nIn May 2019, we acquired Verodin, a security instrumentation platform company. As consideration for the acquisition, we paid $143.7 million in cash, issued 8,404,609 shares of our common stock with an estimated fair value of $119.7 million and recognized $1.5 million of the fair value of assumed stock options attributable to pre-combination services.\nOn October 8, 2021, we completed the previously announced sale of the FireEye Products business to Magenta Buyer LLC (\"Trellix\"), which is backed by a consortium led by Symphony Technology Group. Upon the sale on October 8, 2021, we received approximately $1.2 billion, net of cash disposed. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred cash payments of $29.8 million related to the sale of our FireEye Products business, which have been presented as operating cash flows from discontinued operations.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and any cash inflow from operations, which we believe will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. While we have experienced delays in collections which we attribute to the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe we will be able to manage liquidity to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the efficiency of our marketing and sales activities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings, the cost of any future acquisitions of technology or businesses, and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In the event that additional financing is required from outside\nsources, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOperating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, our operating activities from continuing operations used cash of $62.4 million. We incurred a loss from continuing operations of $412.1 million, which included net non-cash expenses of $314.1 million, primarily consisting of stock-based compensation charges, depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash interest expense related to convertible notes and loss on disposal of property and equipment and write-down of operating right-of-use assets related to relocating our corporate headquarters. Our net change in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $35.6 million, primarily related to cash sourced from a decrease in deferred revenue of $126.1 million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $1.0 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $67.6 million due to a significant increase in fourth quarter billings as compared to 2020, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $14.4 million and a decrease in other long-term liabilities of $9.4 million. Cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations was $124.3 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, our operating activities from continuing operations used cash of $100.4 million. We incurred a loss from continuing operations of $349.3 million, which included net non-cash expenses of $239.3 million, primarily consisting of stock-based compensation charges, depreciation and amortization expense and non-cash interest expense related to our convertible notes. Our net change in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $9.6 million, primarily due to an increase in accrued compensation of $28.6 million, a decrease in deferred revenue of $8.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in other long-term liabilities of $14.9 million and a decrease in accounts payables and accrued liabilities of $13.4 million. Cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations was $195.3 million.\nInvesting Activities\nCash provided by investing activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $705.8 million, which was primarily due to $1.2 billion of net proceeds received from the divestiture of the FireEye Products business, partially offset by $430.1 million net spending on short-term marketable securities as purchases exceeded maturities and sales proceeds, capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment of $25.5 million and by $11.7 million used to acquire Intrigue. Cash used in investing activities from discontinued operations was $16 million.\nCash used by investing activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $22.3 million. This was primarily due to $82.2 million used to acquire Cloudvisory and Respond, net of cash acquired, and $17.9 million used for capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment, partially offset by $79.1 million of net receipts from short-term investments as maturities and sales exceeded purchases. Cash used in investing activities from discontinued operations was $49.9 million.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, financing activities used $273.4 million in cash, primarily for share repurchases of $288.5 million, and payment related to shares withheld for taxes of $11.2 million, partially offset by $26.4 million received from employee purchases of shares under our 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") and exercises of employee stock options.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, financing activities provided $319.1 million in cash, primarily from proceeds of $395.3 million received from the issuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, net of issuance costs, and proceeds of $29.5 million from employee purchases of shares under our ESPP and exercises of employee stock options.\nNet cash provided by (used in) discontinued operations:\nCash provided by discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $108.0 million as compared to cash provided by discontinued operations of $145.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $37.4 million decrease was primarily due to a $71.0 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities offset by a $33.6 million increase in cash used in investing activities. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to a $28.5 million decrease in net income excluding the gain from the FireEye Products business divestiture and a $15.1 million decrease in cash flows related to operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to not having any business acquisitions related to discontinued operations in 2021 compared to the $41.5 million used for business acquisitions in 2020.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2021:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible Notes </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,121,318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,959 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>482,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>626,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases </td> <td>79,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,315 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,254 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>20,572 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,450 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,611 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,221,521 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>519,946 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>649,012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,254 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal future payments related to our Convertible Notes of $1.1 billion shown in the table above is composed of $23.4 million principal amount of Series A Notes, $460 million principal amount of Series B Notes, $600 million principal amount of 2024 Notes and future interest payments of $37.9 million. Although the 2035 Notes have a stated maturity of June 1, 2035, they have been reflected in the table above assuming repurchase on June 1, 2025 in the case of the Series A Notes and June 1, 2022 in the case of the Series B Notes (the earliest future date holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or any portion of their Convertible Senior Notes) at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest as of these dates.\nDue to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2021, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, approximately $5.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits classified as Other long-term liabilities\u201d in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2021, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, which were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other purposes.\nSegment Information\nWe have one primary business activity and operate in one reportable segment.\nConcentration\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, one reseller represented 10% of the Company's total revenue, but did not represent 10% or greater of the Company's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOur agreements with the distributors and reseller were made in the ordinary course of our business and may be terminated with or without cause by either party with advance notice. Although we believe we would experience some short-term disruption in the distribution of our products and subscriptions and services if these agreements were terminated, we believe such termination would not have a long-term material adverse effect on our financial results and that alternative resellers and other channel partners exist who would be able to deliver our products to our end-customers.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nRevenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met:\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer - A contract with a customer exists when (i) we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party's rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred and identifies the payment terms related to these goods or services, (ii) the contract has commercial substance and the parties are committed to perform, and (iii) we determine that collection of substantially all consideration to which it will be entitled in\nexchange for goods or services that will be transferred is probable based on the customer's intent and ability to pay the promised consideration.\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in the contract - Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the goods or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the goods or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised goods or services, we apply judgment to determine whether promised goods or services are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price - The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer adjusted for estimated variable consideration, if any. We typically estimate the transaction price impact of discounts offered to the customers for early payments on receivables or rebates based on channel partner sales achievements. Constraints are applied when estimating variable considerations based on historical experience where applicable.\n\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract - If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\") basis. Determination of SSP requires judgment. We determine standalone selling price taking into account available information such as historical selling prices of the performance obligation, geographic location, overall strategic pricing objective, market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy performance obligations - We satisfy performance obligations either over time or at a point in time as discussed in further detail below. Revenue is recognized at or over the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring a promised good or service to a customer.\nNature of Solutions and Services\nWe generate revenue from the sales of cloud based subscriptions, managed services and professional services, primarily through our indirect relationships through our partners or direct relationships through our direct sales-force. We account for our performance obligations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, regarding Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 ( ASC 606\u201d) and all related interpretations.\nRevenue from subscriptions to our cloud-based solutions, which allow customers to use our hosted security software over a contracted period without taking possession of the software and managed services where we provide managed detection and response services for customers, are recognized over the contractual term. A small portion of our revenue is derived from our validation software deployed on premise that is not dependent on regular threat intelligence updates. Revenue from these solutions is therefore recognized when ownership is transferred to our customers, typically upon delivery of the license.\nProfessional services, which include incident response, security assessments, and other strategic security consulting services are offered on a time-and-materials basis or through fixed fee arrangements, and we recognize the associated revenue as the services are delivered.\nDiscontinued Operations\nRevenue from discontinued operations was generated primarily from sales of network, email, endpoint security, Helix SIEM and Cloudvisory solutions deployed on a customer's premises, either as an integrated security appliance or a distributed hybrid on-premise/private cloud configurations. As a single performance obligation, revenue from sales of appliance hardware and related subscriptions was recognized ratably over the contractual term, typically one to three years. Such contracts typically contained a material right of renewal option that allows the customer to renew their DTI cloud and support subscriptions for an additional term at a discount to the original purchase price of the single performance obligation. For contracts that contained a material right of renewal option, the value of the performance obligation allocated to the renewal was recognized ratably over the period between the end of the initial contractual term and end of the estimated useful life of the related appliance and license. A small portion of our revenue in the product and related subscription and support revenue related to discontinued operations was derived from the sale of our network forensics appliances and our central management system appliances. These appliances were not dependent on regular security intelligence updates, and revenue from these appliances was therefore recognized when ownership was transferred to our customer, typically at shipment.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense related to stock-based transactions, including employee and non-employee director stock options, is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the awards granted. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and a single option award approach. The fair value of stock options granted to non-employees is remeasured as the stock options vest, and the resulting change in value, if any, is recognized\nin the statement of operations during the period the related services are rendered. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally four years.\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock prior to our IPO in September 2013, the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. These assumptions and estimates are as follows:\n\u2022Fair Value of Common Stock. Because our common stock was not publicly traded until September 20, 2013, we were required to estimate the fair value of common stock for grants made prior to that date, as discussed in Common Stock Valuations\u201d below.\n\u2022Risk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equivalent to that of the options for each option group.\n\u2022Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We base the expected term assumption on our historical exercise behavior combined with estimates of the post-vesting holding period.\n\u2022Volatility. We determine the price volatility factor based on the historical volatilities of our publicly traded peer group as we do not have a significant trading history for our common stock. Industry peers consist of several public companies in the technology industry that are similar to us in size, stage of life cycle, and financial leverage. We used the same set of peer group companies in all the relevant valuation estimates. We did not rely on implied volatilities of traded options in our industry peers' common stock because the volume of activity was relatively low. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.\n\u2022Dividend Yield. The expected dividend assumption is based on our current expectations about our anticipated dividend policy. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.\nIn addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we also estimated a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation expense for our awards prior to January 1, 2016. Beginning January 1, 2016, we began recognizing forfeitures as they occur with the adoption of ASU 2016-09.\nWe estimate the fair value of the rights to acquire stock under our ESPP using the Black-Scholes option pricing formula. Our ESPP typically provides for consecutive twelve-month offering periods and we use our peer group volatility data in the valuation of ESPP shares. We recognize such compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nWe account for the fair value of restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. For new-hire grants, RSUs generally vest ratably on an annual basis over four years. For annual refresh grants, RSUs generally vest ratably on an annual, or combination of annual and quarterly, basis over two to four years.\nWe account for the fair value of performance stock units (\"PSUs\") using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. We begin recognizing compensation expense when we conclude that it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved. We reassess the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjust our compensation cost based on this probability assessment.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to our estimates which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. We recognize taxes on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ( GILTI\u201d) as a current period expense when incurred.\nWe apply the authoritative accounting guidance prescribing a threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available\nevidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nSignificant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, past operating results, the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimates of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans. Assumptions represent management's best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. Should actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted.\nWe do not provide for a U.S. income tax liability and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as a result of cumulative and current overall foreign loss. The earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries are currently expected to be indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired, or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible, and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted, or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.\nGoodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. In the valuation of our goodwill, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows to be derived from our business. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment for these assets. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has determined that it operates as one reporting unit and has selected December 1 as the date to perform its annual impairment test.\nWe perform the impairment testing by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In assessing the qualitative factors, we consider the impact of certain key factors including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, management turnover, changes in regulation, litigation matters, changes in enterprise value, and overall financial performance. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then it performs a quantitative assessment to determine whether there is any impairment. To calculate any potential impairment, the Company compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nPurchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives are assessed for potential impairment annually, or when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might be impaired.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for all of our acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The fair value of purchase consideration is allocated to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nWhen determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to identifiable intangible assets. Significant assumptions in valuing certain identifiable intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected long-term market growth, customer retention, future expected operating expenses, costs\nof capital, and appropriate discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nDiscontinued Operations\nWe consider assets to be held for sale when management commits to a formal plan to actively market the assets for sale at a price reasonable in relation to fair value, it is unlikely that significant changes will be made to the plan, the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition, an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the sale have been initiated and the sale of the assets is expected to be completed within one year. Upon designation as held for sale, we record the carrying value of the assets at the lower of the then current carrying value or estimated fair value, less costs to sell. Fair value is determined based on external data available or management's estimates, depending upon the nature of the assets and liabilities. Goodwill is allocated to the FireEye Products business and designated as held for sale based on the relative fair values of the FireEye Products business and the remaining business. The fair value is determined based on the Company's market capitalization and management's estimate of the control premium a buyer would pay to obtain control of the business. Following recording as such, assets held for sale are not depreciated or amortized thereafter.\nIf the disposal of the component of an entity (or group of components) represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results, it meets the criteria for discontinued operations. The results of discontinued operations, as well as any gain or loss on the disposal transaction, are presented separately, net of tax, from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented. The revenue and expenses included in the results of discontinued operations are the revenue and direct operating expenses incurred by the discontinued component that may be reasonably segregated from the revenue and costs of the ongoing operations of the Company. The assets and liabilities for the FireEye Products business have been accounted for as assets and liabilities held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets. The operating results have been included in discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. The consolidated statement of cash flows presents combined cash flows from continuing operations with cash flows from discontinued operations within each cash flow statement category. The prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, \"Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" contained in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a full description of the recent accounting pronouncements and our expectation of their impact, if any, on our results of operations and financial conditions.", "summary": "The report provides an analysis of the financial condition and operations of the company, focusing on its cybersecurity solutions and services. It highlights the completion of the sale of FireEye Products business and its impact on the financial statements.

Additionally, it describes the revenue streams, key business metrics, and factors influencing business performance, such as market adoption, sales productivity, customer acquisition and retention, and follow-on sales.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion focuses on our 2021 and 2020 financial condition and results of operations, including comparisons of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. For discussion and analysis related to our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2019, including comparisons of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2020, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2021.\nIn addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those under Risk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe provide a broad portfolio of cybersecurity solutions and services that allow organizations to prepare for, prevent, respond to, investigate and remediate cyber-attacks. Our portfolio includes threat intelligence, security validation, attack surface management and automated alert investigation integrated in the Mandiant Advantage platform, managed services and consulting services.\nOn October 8, 2021, we completed the previously announced sale of the FireEye Products business to Magenta Buyer LLC (\"Trellix\"), which is backed by a consortium led by Symphony Technology Group, in exchange for total cash consideration of $1.2 billion, subject to certain purchase price adjustments, and assumption of certain liabilities of the FireEye Products business as specified in the Purchase Agreement, as amended by an Amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement entered into on October 8, 2021. As a result, all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements and other portions of this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been conformed to present the FireEye Products business as discontinued operations and the related assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale for all comparative periods presented.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic. The pandemic has impacted, and could further impact, our operations and the operations of our customers as a result of quarantines, various local, state and federal government public health orders, facility and business closures, supply chain shortages, vaccination mandates, and travel and logistics restrictions. With our COVID-19 safety plans, work-from-home and return-to-office policies and restricted employee travel to essential, business-critical trips, we were able to maintain strong customer relationships and deliver our technology-enabled managed and professional services to customers without interruption. As a result, we did not incur significant disruptions to our operations during the year ended December 31, 2021 due to the pandemic.\nIn January 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA\u201d) Emergency Temporary Standard (the ETS\u201d) requiring that all employers with at least 100 employees ensure that their U.S. employees are fully vaccinated for COVID-19. Following that ruling, OSHA chose to withdraw the vaccine ETS altogether. In addition, the federal district court in Georgia stayed the enforcement of the mandatory employee COVID-19 vaccination requirement found in President Biden's Executive Order for U.S. government contractors and their subcontractors (the Executive Order\u201d). As a result, we revised our COVID-19 policy to only require COVID-19 vaccination for employees or visitors that will be entering any of Mandiant's U.S. office locations. We are also complying with the other aspects of the Executive Order for federal government contractors at our covered contractor workplaces that have not been stayed by the federal courts. Our implementation and enforcement of vaccination requirements could be difficult, costly, and potentially result in employee attrition, including attrition of key employees, disruptions in workforce performance, and difficulty securing future labor needs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe anticipate governments and businesses may take additional actions or extend existing actions to respond to the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to actively monitor the impacts and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in all aspects of our business. Although we are unable to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including any recurrence of the virus or its variants, on our business, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources at this time, we expect we may be negatively affected if the pandemic and related public health measures further result in substantial manufacturing or supply chain problems, disruptions in local and global economies, volatility in the global financial markets, overall reductions in demand, delays in payment, or other ramifications from the COVID-19 pandemic. For a further discussion of the uncertainties and business risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, see the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Business Model\nWe generate revenue from Mandiant Solutions. Pursuant to our agreement to sell the FireEye Products business to a consortium led by STG, the revenue from FireEye Products has been included within discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. We disaggregate our revenue from Mandiant Solutions into two main categories: (i) platform,\ncloud subscription and managed services and (ii) professional services. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 49%, 50% and 49%, respectively. Revenue from professional services was 51%, 50% and 51% of total revenue for December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nPlatform, cloud subscription and managed services\nThe majority of our platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue is generated from sales of subscriptions to our Mandiant Advantage platform and modules (including Security Validation, Threat Intelligence and Automated Defense and Attack Surface Management) and managed services that are delivered through the cloud. A majority of the revenue in this category is recognized ratably over the contractual term, generally one to three years.\nWhile our threat intelligence and automated defense modules are only available through the cloud, a portion of our revenue in the platform, cloud subscription and managed services category is derived from term licenses of our Security Validation module deployed on premise, and revenue from these sales is recognized when the license key is issued to the customer. Revenue from the sale of our on-premise Security Validation term licenses continues to decline as we encourage our new and existing customers to migrate their solution to the cloud-based Mandiant Advantage platform for greater flexibility and integration with our Threat Intelligence Attack Surface Management and Automated Defense modules. An increasing number of new Security Validation customers are purchasing subscriptions for the cloud-based Mandiant Advantage Security Validation module, and we expect an increasing number of Security Validation customers to renew on the cloud-based Mandiant Advantage module. Deferred revenue from our platform, cloud subscription and managed services totaled $271.0 million and $182.8 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nProfessional Services\nIn addition to our platform, cloud subscription and managed services, we offer professional services, including incident response and other strategic security consulting services, to our customers who have experienced a cybersecurity breach or desire assistance assessing and increasing the resilience of their IT environments to cyber-attack. The majority our professional services are offered on a time and materials basis, through a fixed fee arrangement, or on a retainer basis. Revenue from professional services is recognized as services are delivered. Revenue from our Expertise On Demand subscription and some pre-paid professional services is deferred, and revenue is recognized when services are delivered. Deferred revenue from professional services as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $139.3 million and $101.5 million, respectively.\nDiscontinued Operations\nRevenue from discontinued operations was generated primarily from sales of network, email, endpoint security, Helix SIEM and Cloudvisory solutions deployed on a customer's premises, either as an integrated security appliance or a distributed hybrid on-premise/private cloud configurations. As a single performance obligation, revenue from sales of appliance hardware and related subscriptions was recognized ratably over the contractual term, typically one to three years. Such contracts typically contained a material right of renewal option that allows the customer to renew their Dynamic Threat Intelligence (\"DTI\") cloud and support subscriptions for an additional term at a discount to the original purchase price of the single performance obligation. For contracts that contained a material right of renewal option, the value of the performance obligation allocated to the renewal was recognized ratably over the period between the end of the initial contractual term and end of the estimated useful life of the related appliance and license. A small portion of our revenue in the product and related subscription and support revenue related to discontinued operations was derived from the sale of our network forensics appliances and our central management system appliances. These appliances were not dependent on regular security intelligence updates, and revenue from these appliances was therefore recognized when ownership was transferred to our customer, typically at shipment.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe monitor our key business metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We discuss revenue and gross margin below under Components of Operating Results.\u201d Deferred revenue, annualized recurring revenue, billings (a non-GAAP metric), net cash flow used in operating activities, and free cash flow (a non-GAAP metric) are discussed immediately below the following table (in thousands, except percentages).\n\nDeferred revenue. Our deferred revenue consists of amounts that we have the right to invoice but have not yet been recognized into revenue as of the end of the respective period. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods. The majority of our deferred revenue consists of the unamortized balance of deferred revenue from previously invoiced sales of our security validation platforms, threat intelligence, consulting services and managed detection and response services and excludes deferred revenue from discontinued operations included in liabilities held for sale. Invoiced amounts for such contracts can be for multiple years, and we classify our deferred revenue as current or non-current depending on when we expect to recognize the related revenue. If the deferred revenue is expected to be recognized within 12 months it is classified as current, otherwise, the deferred revenue is classified as non-current. A table for our deferred revenue is provided below (in thousands):\n\nAnnualized recurring revenue. Annualized recurring revenue (\"ARR\") is an operating metric and represents the annualized revenue run-rate of active term licenses, subscriptions, managed services and support contracts at the end of a reporting period. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as ARR is an operating metric and is not intended to be combined with or replace revenue or deferred revenue. ARR is not a forecast of future revenue, which can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates, and does not include revenue from consumption-based contracts or professional services except for service level agreement payments. We consider ARR a useful measure of the value of the recurring components of our business because it reflects both our ability to attract new customers for our solutions and our success at retaining and expanding our relationships with existing customers. Further, ARR is not impacted by variations in contract length, enabling more meaningful comparison to prior periods as we align our invoicing practices to growing customer preference for annual billing on multi-year contracts. We started including ARR from service level agreement payments in our ARR calculation starting in 2020 once they became material. ARR calculations for 2019 have been updated for comparative purposes. A table for our ARR is provided below (in thousands): \nBillings. Billings are a non-GAAP financial metric that we define as revenue recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period, excluding deferred revenue assumed through acquisitions. We monitor billings as a supplement to revenue (the corresponding GAAP measure), because billings impact our deferred revenue, which is an important indicator of the health and visibility of trends in our business and represents a significant percentage of future revenue. However, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may define billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure. Additionally, the calculated billings metric represents the total contract value we have the right to invoice, which includes multi-year subscriptions to our solutions as well as commitments for future service engagements. Calculated billings are impacted by changes in average contract length, thereby reducing the usefulness of comparisons to prior periods. Unlike subscription revenue, which is recognized ratably over a contract term, services revenue is recognized when services are delivered, making calculated services billings less useful as a measure of current business activity.\nA reconciliation of billings to revenue, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below (in thousands):\n\nWe have provided disaggregation of billings below (in thousands):\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations. We monitor net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. Our net cash provided by operating activities performance is driven in large part by sales of our offerings in the platform, cloud subscription, managed services category and professional services and from up-front payments for both subscriptions and services. Monitoring net cash used in operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items, such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation costs, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business.\nFree cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure we define as net cash used in operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, less purchases of property and equipment. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that, after the purchases of property and equipment, can be used by us for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, debt repayment, strengthening our balance sheet and share repurchases. However, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow differently, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flow used in operating activities is provided below (in thousands):\n\nFactors Affecting our Performance\nMarket Adoption. We rely on market education to raise awareness of today's cyber-attacks and articulate the need for our solutions and services. Although our security validation and automated defense solutions address significant challenges experienced by customers when implementing effective cybersecurity safeguards - challenges that include an expanding attack surface from remote workers and digital transformation, proliferation of nation state-sponsored attackers, and an acute shortage of cybersecurity talent - the markets for these solutions are in the early stages of development. As a result, our prospective customers may not have a specific portion of their IT budgets allocated for our advanced security solutions.\nWe invest heavily in sales and marketing efforts to increase market awareness, educate prospective customers and drive adoption of our solutions and services. Additionally, our consultants use our technology in their engagements, allowing customers to witness the features and capabilities of their IT environments. This market education is critical to creating new IT budget dollars or allocating more of existing IT budget dollars to cybersecurity in general and specifically our security validation and security automation solutions. The degree to which prospective customers recognize the mission critical need for our solutions will drive our ability to acquire new customers and increase renewals and follow-on sales opportunities, which, in turn, will affect our future financial performance.\nSales Productivity. Our sales organization consists of in-house sales teams who work in collaboration with external channel partners to identify new sales prospects, sell additional products, subscriptions and services, and provide post-sale support. Our direct sales teams are organized by territory to target large enterprise and government customers who typically have sales cycles that can last several months or more. We have also expanded our inside sales teams to work with channel partners to expand our customer base of small and medium enterprises, or SMEs, as well as manage renewals of subscription and support contracts.\nNewly hired sales and marketing employees typically require several months to establish prospect relationships and achieve full sales productivity. In addition, although we believe our investments in market education have increased awareness of us and our solutions globally, sales teams in certain international markets may face local markets with limited awareness of us and our solutions, or have customer-specific requirements that are not available with our solutions. These factors will influence the timing and overall levels of sales productivity, impacting the rate at which we will be able to convert prospects to sales and drive revenue growth.\nCustomer Acquisition and Retention. Since we expect that our existing customers are likely to expand their deployments and purchase additional solutions from us over time, we believe new customer acquisition and retention thereafter of existing customers is essential to expanding the value of our installed base, which we monitor through our key business metrics, including annualized recurring revenue. We believe our ability to maintain strong customer retention and drive new customer acquisition will have a material impact on future sales of our security solutions and services and therefore our future financial performance.\nFollow-On Sales. To grow our revenue, it is important that our customers make additional purchases of our solutions and services. After the initial sale to a new customer, we focus on expanding our relationship with the customer to sell additional modules available on the Mandiant Advantage platform as well as add additional services. Sales to our existing customer base can take the form of incremental sales of our solutions, managed services, and consulting services either to expand their deployment of our technologies, to extend their internal security resources with our managed and professional security services, or to continuously measure the effectiveness of their security controls. Our opportunity to expand our customer relationships through follow-on sales will increase as we demonstrate the utility of our solutions, broaden our security solutions portfolio with additional subscriptions and services and enhance the functionality of our existing solutions. Follow-on sales lead to increased revenue over the lifecycle of a customer relationship and can significantly increase the return on our sales and marketing investments. With many of our large enterprise and government customers, we have realized follow-on sales that were multiples of the value of their initial purchases.\nComponents of Operating Results\nAs a result of the sale of the FireEye Products business, all periods presented in this Form 10-K have been conformed to present the FireEye Products business as discontinued operations. We report the financial results of discontinued operations separately from continuing operations to distinguish the financial impact of disposal transactions from ongoing operations. The results of operations and cash flows of a discontinued operation are restated for all comparative periods presented. Refer to Note 2, Discontinued Operations,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from the sales of our Mandiant solutions and services. Revenue is recognized when a contract has been entered into with a customer, the performance obligation(s) is (are) identified, the transaction price is determined and has been\nallocated to the performance obligation(s) and only then for each performance obligation after we have satisfied that performance obligation.\n\u2022Platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue. The majority of our platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue is generated from sales of subscriptions to our Mandiant Advantage platform and modules (security validation, threat intelligence, and automated defense) and to our managed services that are delivered through the cloud and is recognized over the term of the contract. A small portion of our revenue in the platform, cloud subscription and managed services category is derived from sales of on premise term licenses to our security validation platform, and revenue from these sales is recognized when the license key is issued to the customer.\n\u2022Consulting services revenue. Consulting services, which includes incident response, security assessments, and other strategic security consulting services, are offered on a time-and-material basis, through a fixed fee arrangement, or on a retainer basis. We recognize the associated revenue as the services are delivered. Some consulting services and our expertise-on-demand subscription are prepaid, and revenue is deferred until services are delivered.\nCost of Revenue\nOur total cost of revenue consists of cost of cloud and managed service revenue and cost of consulting services revenue.\n\u2022Cost of platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue. Cost of platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue primarily consists of personnel costs associated with maintaining our threat intelligence and delivering our managed services, hosting costs paid to third party cloud platform providers, and allocated overhead costs. Personnel costs associated with maintaining our threat intelligence and delivering our managed services consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. Overhead costs consist of certain facilities, depreciation and information technology costs. If revenue from sales of our cloud and managed services declines, the cost of platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue may increase as a percentage of cloud and managed services revenue due to the fixed nature of a portion of these costs.\n\u2022Cost of consulting services revenue. Cost of consulting services revenue primarily consists of personnel costs for our services organization and allocated overhead costs. If sales of our consulting services decline or we are unable to maintain our chargeability or billing rates, our cost of consulting services revenue may increase as a percentage of consulting services revenue.\nGross Margin\nGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the mix between platform, cloud subscription and managed services and professional services revenue, the mix of incident response and other strategic security consulting, and the amount of reimbursable travel expenses. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate slightly depending on these factors, but increase over time with expected growth and higher mix of platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue compared to professional services revenue.\nAlthough FireEye products revenue is included in discontinued operations, indirect overhead costs are not allocated to the discontinued operations as they are not direct costs of the FireEye Product business, resulting in a decrease in gross margins.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation and, with regard to sales", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion focuses on our 2021 and 2020 financial condition and results of operations, including comparisons of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. For discussion and analysis related to our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2019, including comparisons of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2020, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2021.\nIn addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those under Risk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe provide a broad portfolio of cybersecurity solutions and services that allow organizations to prepare for, prevent, respond to, investigate and remediate cyber-attacks. Our portfolio includes threat intelligence, security validation, attack surface management and automated alert investigation integrated in the Mandiant Advantage platform, managed services and consulting services.\nOn October 8, 2021, we completed the previously announced sale of the FireEye Products business to Magenta Buyer LLC (\"Trellix\"), which is backed by a consortium led by Symphony Technology Group, in exchange for total cash consideration of $1.2 billion, subject to certain purchase price adjustments, and assumption of certain liabilities of the FireEye Products business as specified in the Purchase Agreement, as amended by an Amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement entered into on October 8, 2021. As a result, all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements and other portions of this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been conformed to present the FireEye Products business as discontinued operations and the related assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale for all comparative periods presented.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic. The pandemic has impacted, and could further impact, our operations and the operations of our customers as a result of quarantines, various local, state and federal government public health orders, facility and business closures, supply chain shortages, vaccination mandates, and travel and logistics restrictions. With our COVID-19 safety plans, work-from-home and return-to-office policies and restricted employee travel to essential, business-critical trips, we were able to maintain strong customer relationships and deliver our technology-enabled managed and professional services to customers without interruption. As a result, we did not incur significant disruptions to our operations during the year ended December 31, 2021 due to the pandemic.\nIn January 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA\u201d) Emergency Temporary Standard (the ETS\u201d) requiring that all employers with at least 100 employees ensure that their U.S. employees are fully vaccinated for COVID-19. Following that ruling, OSHA chose to withdraw the vaccine ETS altogether. In addition, the federal district court in Georgia stayed the enforcement of the mandatory employee COVID-19 vaccination requirement found in President Biden's Executive Order for U.S. government contractors and their subcontractors (the Executive Order\u201d). As a result, we revised our COVID-19 policy to only require COVID-19 vaccination for employees or visitors that will be entering any of Mandiant's U.S. office locations. We are also complying with the other aspects of the Executive Order for federal government contractors at our covered contractor workplaces that have not been stayed by the federal courts. Our implementation and enforcement of vaccination requirements could be difficult, costly, and potentially result in employee attrition, including attrition of key employees, disruptions in workforce performance, and difficulty securing future labor needs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe anticipate governments and businesses may take additional actions or extend existing actions to respond to the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to actively monitor the impacts and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in all aspects of our business. Although we are unable to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including any recurrence of the virus or its variants, on our business, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources at this time, we expect we may be negatively affected if the pandemic and related public health measures further result in substantial manufacturing or supply chain problems, disruptions in local and global economies, volatility in the global financial markets, overall reductions in demand, delays in payment, or other ramifications from the COVID-19 pandemic. For a further discussion of the uncertainties and business risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, see the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Business Model\nWe generate revenue from Mandiant Solutions. Pursuant to our agreement to sell the FireEye Products business to a consortium led by STG, the revenue from FireEye Products has been included within discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. We disaggregate our revenue from Mandiant Solutions into two main categories: (i) platform,\ncloud subscription and managed services and (ii) professional services. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 49%, 50% and 49%, respectively. Revenue from professional services was 51%, 50% and 51% of total revenue for December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nPlatform, cloud subscription and managed services\nThe majority of our platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue is generated from sales of subscriptions to our Mandiant Advantage platform and modules (including Security Validation, Threat Intelligence and Automated Defense and Attack Surface Management) and managed services that are delivered through the cloud. A majority of the revenue in this category is recognized ratably over the contractual term, generally one to three years.\nWhile our threat intelligence and automated defense modules are only available through the cloud, a portion of our revenue in the platform, cloud subscription and managed services category is derived from term licenses of our Security Validation module deployed on premise, and revenue from these sales is recognized when the license key is issued to the customer. Revenue from the sale of our on-premise Security Validation term licenses continues to decline as we encourage our new and existing customers to migrate their solution to the cloud-based Mandiant Advantage platform for greater flexibility and integration with our Threat Intelligence Attack Surface Management and Automated Defense modules. An increasing number of new Security Validation customers are purchasing subscriptions for the cloud-based Mandiant Advantage Security Validation module, and we expect an increasing number of Security Validation customers to renew on the cloud-based Mandiant Advantage module. Deferred revenue from our platform, cloud subscription and managed services totaled $271.0 million and $182.8 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nProfessional Services\nIn addition to our platform, cloud subscription and managed services, we offer professional services, including incident response and other strategic security consulting services, to our customers who have experienced a cybersecurity breach or desire assistance assessing and increasing the resilience of their IT environments to cyber-attack. The majority our professional services are offered on a time and materials basis, through a fixed fee arrangement, or on a retainer basis. Revenue from professional services is recognized as services are delivered. Revenue from our Expertise On Demand subscription and some pre-paid professional services is deferred, and revenue is recognized when services are delivered. Deferred revenue from professional services as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $139.3 million and $101.5 million, respectively.\nDiscontinued Operations\nRevenue from discontinued operations was generated primarily from sales of network, email, endpoint security, Helix SIEM and Cloudvisory solutions deployed on a customer's premises, either as an integrated security appliance or a distributed hybrid on-premise/private cloud configurations. As a single performance obligation, revenue from sales of appliance hardware and related subscriptions was recognized ratably over the contractual term, typically one to three years. Such contracts typically contained a material right of renewal option that allows the customer to renew their Dynamic Threat Intelligence (\"DTI\") cloud and support subscriptions for an additional term at a discount to the original purchase price of the single performance obligation. For contracts that contained a material right of renewal option, the value of the performance obligation allocated to the renewal was recognized ratably over the period between the end of the initial contractual term and end of the estimated useful life of the related appliance and license. A small portion of our revenue in the product and related subscription and support revenue related to discontinued operations was derived from the sale of our network forensics appliances and our central management system appliances. These appliances were not dependent on regular security intelligence updates, and revenue from these appliances was therefore recognized when ownership was transferred to our customer, typically at shipment.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe monitor our key business metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We discuss revenue and gross margin below under Components of Operating Results.\u201d Deferred revenue, annualized recurring revenue, billings (a non-GAAP metric), net cash flow used in operating activities, and free cash flow (a non-GAAP metric) are discussed immediately below the following table (in thousands, except percentages).\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended or as of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>235,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>198,695 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>163,583 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services revenue\n</td> <td>248,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>201,014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>167,787 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>483,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>399,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>331,370 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year-over-year percentage increase\n</td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>47 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred revenue (current and non-current)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>410,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>284,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>273,241 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized recurring revenue\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>278,819 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>226,451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>196,014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billings (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>609,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>408,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>369,879 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities - continuing operations\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(62,389) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(100,409) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(120,786) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities - discontinued operations\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>195,304 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>188,323 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,537 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow (non-GAAP) (continuing operations)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(87,925) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(118,337) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(150,135) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeferred revenue. Our deferred revenue consists of amounts that we have the right to invoice but have not yet been recognized into revenue as of the end of the respective period. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods. The majority of our deferred revenue consists of the unamortized balance of deferred revenue from previously invoiced sales of our security validation platforms, threat intelligence, consulting services and managed detection and response services and excludes deferred revenue from discontinued operations included in liabilities held for sale. Invoiced amounts for such contracts can be for multiple years, and we classify our deferred revenue as current or non-current depending on when we expect to recognize the related revenue. If the deferred revenue is expected to be recognized within 12 months it is classified as current, otherwise, the deferred revenue is classified as non-current. A table for our deferred revenue is provided below (in thousands):\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred revenue, current\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>307,611 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>226,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred revenue, non-current\n</td> <td>102,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,897 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deferred revenue\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>410,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>284,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnnualized recurring revenue. Annualized recurring revenue (\"ARR\") is an operating metric and represents the annualized revenue run-rate of active term licenses, subscriptions, managed services and support contracts at the end of a reporting period. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as ARR is an operating metric and is not intended to be combined with or replace revenue or deferred revenue. ARR is not a forecast of future revenue, which can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates, and does not include revenue from consumption-based contracts or professional services except for service level agreement payments. We consider ARR a useful measure of the value of the recurring components of our business because it reflects both our ability to attract new customers for our solutions and our success at retaining and expanding our relationships with existing customers. Further, ARR is not impacted by variations in contract length, enabling more meaningful comparison to prior periods as we align our invoicing practices to growing customer preference for annual billing on multi-year contracts. We started including ARR from service level agreement payments in our ARR calculation starting in 2020 once they became material. ARR calculations for 2019 have been updated for comparative purposes. A table for our ARR is provided below (in thousands): Table 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Platform, cloud subscription and managed services\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>268,662 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>219,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>191,477 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services\n</td> <td>10,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,641 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,537 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total annualized recurring revenue\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>278,819 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>226,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>196,014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBillings. Billings are a non-GAAP financial metric that we define as revenue recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period, excluding deferred revenue assumed through acquisitions. We monitor billings as a supplement to revenue (the corresponding GAAP measure), because billings impact our deferred revenue, which is an important indicator of the health and visibility of trends in our business and represents a significant percentage of future revenue. However, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may define billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure. Additionally, the calculated billings metric represents the total contract value we have the right to invoice, which includes multi-year subscriptions to our solutions as well as commitments for future service engagements. Calculated billings are impacted by changes in average contract length, thereby reducing the usefulness of comparisons to prior periods. Unlike subscription revenue, which is recognized ratably over a contract term, services revenue is recognized when services are delivered, making calculated services billings less useful as a measure of current business activity.\nA reconciliation of billings to revenue, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below (in thousands):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>483,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>399,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>331,370 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Deferred revenue, end of period </td> <td>410,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>284,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>273,241 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Deferred revenue, beginning of period </td> <td>(284,253) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(273,241) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(231,982) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Deferred revenue assumed through acquisitions </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,664) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,750) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billings (non-GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>609,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>408,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>369,879 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have provided disaggregation of billings below (in thousands):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Platform, cloud subscription and managed services </td> <td>$ </td> <td>323,319 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>195,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>175,870 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services </td> <td>286,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>212,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>194,009 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billings (non-GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>609,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>408,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>369,879 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations. We monitor net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. Our net cash provided by operating activities performance is driven in large part by sales of our offerings in the platform, cloud subscription, managed services category and professional services and from up-front payments for both subscriptions and services. Monitoring net cash used in operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items, such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation costs, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business.\nFree cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure we define as net cash used in operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, less purchases of property and equipment. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that, after the purchases of property and equipment, can be used by us for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, debt repayment, strengthening our balance sheet and share repurchases. However, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow differently, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flow used in operating activities is provided below (in thousands):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities - continuing operations\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(62,389) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(100,409) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(120,786) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: purchase of property and equipment\n</td> <td>(25,536) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,928) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29,349) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow (non-GAAP) - continuing operations\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(87,925) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(118,337) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(150,135) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities - continuing operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>705,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(22,291) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(105,276) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities - continuing operations\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(273,393) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>319,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,273 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors Affecting our Performance\nMarket Adoption. We rely on market education to raise awareness of today's cyber-attacks and articulate the need for our solutions and services. Although our security validation and automated defense solutions address significant challenges experienced by customers when implementing effective cybersecurity safeguards - challenges that include an expanding attack surface from remote workers and digital transformation, proliferation of nation state-sponsored attackers, and an acute shortage of cybersecurity talent - the markets for these solutions are in the early stages of development. As a result, our prospective customers may not have a specific portion of their IT budgets allocated for our advanced security solutions.\nWe invest heavily in sales and marketing efforts to increase market awareness, educate prospective customers and drive adoption of our solutions and services. Additionally, our consultants use our technology in their engagements, allowing customers to witness the features and capabilities of their IT environments. This market education is critical to creating new IT budget dollars or allocating more of existing IT budget dollars to cybersecurity in general and specifically our security validation and security automation solutions. The degree to which prospective customers recognize the mission critical need for our solutions will drive our ability to acquire new customers and increase renewals and follow-on sales opportunities, which, in turn, will affect our future financial performance.\nSales Productivity. Our sales organization consists of in-house sales teams who work in collaboration with external channel partners to identify new sales prospects, sell additional products, subscriptions and services, and provide post-sale support. Our direct sales teams are organized by territory to target large enterprise and government customers who typically have sales cycles that can last several months or more. We have also expanded our inside sales teams to work with channel partners to expand our customer base of small and medium enterprises, or SMEs, as well as manage renewals of subscription and support contracts.\nNewly hired sales and marketing employees typically require several months to establish prospect relationships and achieve full sales productivity. In addition, although we believe our investments in market education have increased awareness of us and our solutions globally, sales teams in certain international markets may face local markets with limited awareness of us and our solutions, or have customer-specific requirements that are not available with our solutions. These factors will influence the timing and overall levels of sales productivity, impacting the rate at which we will be able to convert prospects to sales and drive revenue growth.\nCustomer Acquisition and Retention. Since we expect that our existing customers are likely to expand their deployments and purchase additional solutions from us over time, we believe new customer acquisition and retention thereafter of existing customers is essential to expanding the value of our installed base, which we monitor through our key business metrics, including annualized recurring revenue. We believe our ability to maintain strong customer retention and drive new customer acquisition will have a material impact on future sales of our security solutions and services and therefore our future financial performance.\nFollow-On Sales. To grow our revenue, it is important that our customers make additional purchases of our solutions and services. After the initial sale to a new customer, we focus on expanding our relationship with the customer to sell additional modules available on the Mandiant Advantage platform as well as add additional services. Sales to our existing customer base can take the form of incremental sales of our solutions, managed services, and consulting services either to expand their deployment of our technologies, to extend their internal security resources with our managed and professional security services, or to continuously measure the effectiveness of their security controls. Our opportunity to expand our customer relationships through follow-on sales will increase as we demonstrate the utility of our solutions, broaden our security solutions portfolio with additional subscriptions and services and enhance the functionality of our existing solutions. Follow-on sales lead to increased revenue over the lifecycle of a customer relationship and can significantly increase the return on our sales and marketing investments. With many of our large enterprise and government customers, we have realized follow-on sales that were multiples of the value of their initial purchases.\nComponents of Operating Results\nAs a result of the sale of the FireEye Products business, all periods presented in this Form 10-K have been conformed to present the FireEye Products business as discontinued operations. We report the financial results of discontinued operations separately from continuing operations to distinguish the financial impact of disposal transactions from ongoing operations. The results of operations and cash flows of a discontinued operation are restated for all comparative periods presented. Refer to Note 2, Discontinued Operations,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from the sales of our Mandiant solutions and services. Revenue is recognized when a contract has been entered into with a customer, the performance obligation(s) is (are) identified, the transaction price is determined and has been\nallocated to the performance obligation(s) and only then for each performance obligation after we have satisfied that performance obligation.\n\u2022Platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue. The majority of our platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue is generated from sales of subscriptions to our Mandiant Advantage platform and modules (security validation, threat intelligence, and automated defense) and to our managed services that are delivered through the cloud and is recognized over the term of the contract. A small portion of our revenue in the platform, cloud subscription and managed services category is derived from sales of on premise term licenses to our security validation platform, and revenue from these sales is recognized when the license key is issued to the customer.\n\u2022Consulting services revenue. Consulting services, which includes incident response, security assessments, and other strategic security consulting services, are offered on a time-and-material basis, through a fixed fee arrangement, or on a retainer basis. We recognize the associated revenue as the services are delivered. Some consulting services and our expertise-on-demand subscription are prepaid, and revenue is deferred until services are delivered.\nCost of Revenue\nOur total cost of revenue consists of cost of cloud and managed service revenue and cost of consulting services revenue.\n\u2022Cost of platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue. Cost of platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue primarily consists of personnel costs associated with maintaining our threat intelligence and delivering our managed services, hosting costs paid to third party cloud platform providers, and allocated overhead costs. Personnel costs associated with maintaining our threat intelligence and delivering our managed services consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. Overhead costs consist of certain facilities, depreciation and information technology costs. If revenue from sales of our cloud and managed services declines, the cost of platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue may increase as a percentage of cloud and managed services revenue due to the fixed nature of a portion of these costs.\n\u2022Cost of consulting services revenue. Cost of consulting services revenue primarily consists of personnel costs for our services organization and allocated overhead costs. If sales of our consulting services decline or we are unable to maintain our chargeability or billing rates, our cost of consulting services revenue may increase as a percentage of consulting services revenue.\nGross Margin\nGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the mix between platform, cloud subscription and managed services and professional services revenue, the mix of incident response and other strategic security consulting, and the amount of reimbursable travel expenses. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate slightly depending on these factors, but increase over time with expected growth and higher mix of platform, cloud subscription and managed services revenue compared to professional services revenue.\nAlthough FireEye products revenue is included in discontinued operations, indirect overhead costs are not allocated to the discontinued operations as they are not direct costs of the FireEye Product business, resulting in a decrease in gross margins.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation and, with regard to sales"}
