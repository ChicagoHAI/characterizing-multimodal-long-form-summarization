Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. You should read this section in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes (included in Item 8).\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplementary information were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8. Inherent in the application of many of these accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates and judgments in the determination of certain revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. As such, materially different financial results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. The policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operations and financial position include:\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon management's assessment of the business environment, customers' financial condition, historical collection experience, accounts receivable aging, customer disputes and the collectability of specific customer accounts. If there were a deterioration of a major customer's creditworthiness, or actual defaults were higher than our historical experience, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is also affected by the time at which uncollectible accounts receivable balances are actually written off.\nMajor customers' accounts are monitored on an ongoing basis; more in-depth reviews are performed based upon changes in a customer's financial condition and/or the level of credit being extended. When a significant event occurs, such as a bankruptcy filing by a specific customer, and on a quarterly basis, the allowance is reviewed for adequacy and the balance or accrual rate is adjusted to reflect current risk prospects.\nRevenue Recognition. Our revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title transfer has occurred (product shipment), the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Sales are recorded net of sales returns and discounts, which are estimated at the time of shipment based upon historical data. JAKKS routinely enters into arrangements with its customers to provide sales incentives and support customer promotions and we provide allowances for returns and defective merchandise. Such programs are primarily based upon customer purchases, customer performance of specified promotional activities and other specified factors such as sales to consumers. Accruals for these programs are recorded as sales adjustments that reduce gross revenue in the period the related revenue is recognized.\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level.\nFactors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> significant negative industry or economic trends.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDue to the subjective nature of the impairment analysis, significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimate could materially affect the conclusion regarding the future cash flows necessary to support the valuation of long-lived assets, including goodwill. The valuation of goodwill involves a high degree of judgment and uncertainty related to our key assumptions. Any changes in our key projections or estimates could result in a reporting unit either passing or failing the first step of the impairment model, which could significantly change the amount of any impairment ultimately recorded.\nBased upon the assumptions underlying the valuation, impairment is determined by estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing that value to the reporting unit's book value. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually. If the implied fair value is more than the book value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is not indicated. If impairment exists, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of its assets and liabilities excluding goodwill, with the excess amount representing the fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the book value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of that goodwill.\nThe Company assessed its goodwill for impairment as of April 1, 2016 for each of its reporting units by evaluating qualitative factors, including, but not limited to, the performance of each reporting unit, general economic conditions, access to capital, the industry and competitive environment, the interest rate environment. In prior years, the assessment had been performed as of October 1 of each year, however, as of March 31, 2016, the Company revised its reportable segments based on changes to how the businesses are managed and how resources are allocated to the businesses. In conjunction with the required reallocation of goodwill to the new reportable segments as of March 31, 2016, the Company performed its annual assessment as of April 1, 2016. Based on the seasonality of its businesses, the Company has determined that it is most appropriate to perform future annual assessments as of April 1 after completion of the business cycles of each of its reporting units. The Company prepared step-one of its impairment model. Based on the Company's assessment, it determined that the fair values of its reporting units were not less than the carrying amounts. In addition, as a result of operating performance below expectations for the full year of 2016 that became apparent in December 2016, the Company performed a subsequent impairment assessment on goodwill as of December 31, 2016. Based on the Company's assessment, it determined that the fair values of its reporting units were not less than the carrying amounts with excess coverage of fair value over the carrying value of each of the reporting units of 2.0%, 20.6% and 2.0% for U.S. and Canada, International, and Halloween, respectively. As such, the Company determined there was no impairment to be recorded in 2016. The amount of goodwill assigned to each of the three reporting units, U.S. and Canada, International, and Halloween, amounted to $29.5 million, $11.5 million, and $2.2 million, respectively.\nGoodwill and intangible assets amounted to $78.9 million as of December 31, 2016.\nReserve for Inventory Obsolescence. We value our inventory at the lower of cost or market. Based upon a consideration of quantities on hand, actual and projected sales volume, anticipated product selling prices and product lines planned to be discontinued, slow-moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its net realizable value.\nFailure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in us under-producing popular items or overproducing less popular items. Furthermore, significant changes in demand for our products would impact management's estimates in establishing our inventory provision.\nManagement estimates are monitored on a quarterly basis and a further adjustment to reduce inventory to its net realizable value is recorded, as an increase to cost of sales, when deemed necessary under the lower of cost or market standard.\nIncome Allocation for Income Taxes. Our annual income tax provision and related income tax assets and liabilities are based upon actual income as allocated to the various tax jurisdictions based upon our transfer pricing study, US and foreign statutory income tax rates and tax regulations and planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in interpreting tax regulations in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, and in evaluating worldwide uncertain tax positions. Actual results could differ materially from those judgments, and changes from such judgments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome taxes and interest and penalties related to income tax payable. We do not file a consolidated return for our foreign subsidiaries. We file federal and state returns and our foreign subsidiaries each file returns in their respective jurisdictions, as applicable. Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized as deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\nWe must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. We consider all available positive and negative evidence when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in previous periods and our forecast of future taxable income. We believe this to be a critical accounting policy because should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not likely, as well as decrease in the period in which the assessment of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets reverses, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nWe accrue a tax reserve for additional income taxes and interest, which may become payable in future years as a result of audit adjustments by tax authorities. The reserve is based upon management's assessment of all relevant information and is periodically reviewed and adjusted as circumstances warrant. As of December 31, 2016, our income tax reserves were approximately $2.3 million and relates to the potential tax settlement in Hong Kong, adjustments in the area of withholding taxes, and state taxes.\nWe recognize current period interest expense and the reversal of previously recognized interest expense that has been determined to not be assessable due to the expiration of the related audit period or other compelling factors on the income tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense, and penalties and penalty reversals related to the income taxes payable as other expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nShare-Based Compensation. We grant restricted stock and options to purchase our common stock to our employees (including officers) and non-employee directors under our 2002 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the Plan\u201d), which incorporated the shares remaining under our Third Amended and Restated 1995 Stock Option Plan. The benefits provided under the Plan are share-based payments. Related to the stock option grants, we estimate the value of share-based awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, cancellations, terminations, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. Related to the restricted stock award grants, we determine the value of each award based on the market value of the underlying common stock at the date of each grant and expense each award over the stipulated service period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard in 2018.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory\u201d ( ASU 2015-11\u201d). ASU 2015-11 requires inventory accounted for under the FIFO or average cost method to be measured using the lower of cost and net realizable value. The amendments are effective prospectively for fiscal years and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2015-11 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\u201d ( ASU 2016-01\u201d). The new guidance is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently assessing the potential impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases\u201d ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We are currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\u201d ( ASU 2016-09\u201d) which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payments, including income tax consequences and classification on the statement of cash flows. Under the new standard, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies will be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. Additionally, excess tax benefits will be classified as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows. In regard to forfeitures, the entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize forfeitures as they occur or estimate the number of awards expected to be forfeited. The guidance in ASU 2016-09 is effective for the fiscal year, and interim periods within that fiscal year, beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.\u201d The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory.\u201d The amendments in this ASU reduces the complexity in the accounting standards by allowing the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. Historically, recognition of the income tax consequence was not recognized until the asset was sold to an outside party. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain statement of

The products included in the realigned segments are detailed in Part I, Item 1 of the Company's 10-K report. Prior period results have been conformed to the new segment reporting structure.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nNet Sales\nU.S. and Canada. Net sales of our U.S. and Canada segment were $478.6 million in 2016, compared to $478.7 million in 2015, representing a decrease of $0.1 million. Net sales were flat year-over year primarily due to a decrease in unit sales of various products due to the suspension of shipments to a major U.S. customer and lower than expected unit sales of some movie licensed products, offset by higher unit sales of our Disney Tsum Tsum line of collectibles, Disney Princess and Alice Through the Looking Glass dolls, kids furniture and accessories, and our Big Figs line.\nInternational. Net sales of our International segment were $131.2 million in 2016, compared to $169.8 million in 2015, representing a decrease of $38.6 million, or 22.7%. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by declines in unit sales of various products in the United Kingdom and Western Europe due to the reduced buying power of our customers stemming from the devaluation of the British Pound, and lower than expected unit sales of movie licensed product.\nHalloween. Net sales of our Halloween segment were $96.8 million in 2016, compared to $97.2 million in 2015, representing a decrease of $0.4 million, or 0.4%. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to a decrease in unit sales of a variety of products in 2016.\nCost of Sales\nU.S. and Canada. Cost of sales of our U.S. and Canada segment was $322.7 million, or 67.4% of related net sales in 2016 compared to $335.0 million, or 70.0% of related net sales in 2015, representing a decrease of $12.3 million, or 3.7%. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales, year over year, is due to reduced costing of legacy products and product mix, partially offset by increased product tooling driven by new product introductions in 2016. Depreciation of molds and tools for the segment increased slightly in 2016 due to new product tooling driven by product introductions in 2016.\nInternational. Cost of sales of our International segment was $89.2 million, or 68.0% of related net sales in 2016 compared to $110.2 million, or 64.9% of related net sales in 2015, representing a decrease of $21.0 million, or 19.1%. The decrease in cost of sales is a direct function of lower overall unit sales. The increase as a percentage of net sales, year-over-year, is due to the change in product mix to relatively higher cost product and an increase in the average royalty rate. The increase in royalties is driven by a shift in the product mix to products with relatively higher royalty rates and an increase in royalty rates on shipments made FOB China. Our depreciation of molds and tools for the segment showed a modest increase from 2015 due to increased product tooling driven by new product introductions in 2016.\nHalloween. Cost of sales of our Halloween segment was $71.7 million, or 74.1% of related net sales for 2016 compared to $72.0 million, or 74.1% of related net sales in 2015, representing a decrease of $0.3 million, or 0.4%. The percentage of net sales in 2016 is comparable to 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $205.9 million in 2016 and $198.0 million in 2015, constituting 29.1% and 26.5% of net sales, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $7.9 million driven by higher marketing expenses ($6.7 million), higher product development costs in support of increased product launches ($2.5 million), and increased depreciation and amortization ($1.6 million), partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses ($2.9 million).\nProfit from Video Game Joint Venture\nWe recognized $0.2 million of income for funds received in 2016 related to our former video game joint venture in partial settlement of amounts owed to the Company when our joint venture partner was liquidated pursuant to their 2012 bankruptcy filing. In 2015, we recognized $2.7 million in income related to our former video game joint venture. It is not known if any additional funds will be received by us.\nIncome from Joint Ventures\nWe recognized $0.7 million of income for funds received in 2016 related to Pacific Animation Partners compared to $0.1 million received in 2015.\nOther Income\nWe recognized income of $0.2 million for funds received in 2016 related to the disgorgement of short swing trading profits from a shareholder, net of legal fees and a $0.1 million gain on extinguishment of convertible senior notes.\nInterest Income\nInterest income in 2016 was $0.1 million, comparable to $0.1 million in 2015.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $13.0 million in 2016, as compared to $12.4 million in 2015. In 2016, we recorded interest expense of $11.7 million related to our convertible senior notes payable, $0.9 million related to our revolving credit facility and $0.4 million related to the interest component of our Maui acquisition earn-out. In 2015, we recorded interest expense of $11.5 million related to our convertible senior notes payable and $0.9 million related to our revolving credit facility.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur income tax expense, which includes federal, state and foreign income taxes and discrete items, was $4.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 76.8% for 2016. During 2015, the income tax expense was $3.4 million, or an effective tax rate of 12.9%.\nThe 2016 tax expense of $4.1 million included a discrete tax benefit of $0.1 million primarily comprised of return to provision adjustments. Absent these discrete tax benefits, our effective tax rate for 2016 was 79.2%, primarily due to US federal alternative minimum tax, various state taxes and taxes on foreign income.\nThe 2015 tax expense of $3.4 million included a discrete tax expense of $0.9 million primarily comprised of return to provision adjustments. Absent these discrete tax expenses, our effective tax rate for 2015 was 9.5%, primarily due to a full valuation allowance on the Company's United States deferred tax assets and the foreign rate differential, and is impacted by the proportion of Hong Kong earnings to overall earnings and is expected to vary depending on the level of consolidated earnings.\nWe assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets by jurisdiction. Based on our evaluation of all positive and negative evidence, as of December 31, 2016, a valuation allowance of $49.3 million has been recorded against the deferred tax assets that more likely than not will not be realized. The net deferred tax liabilities of $2.0 million represent the net deferred tax liabilities in the foreign jurisdiction, where we are in a cumulative income position.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.0 million related to foreign jurisdictions.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nNet Sales\nU.S. and Canada. Net sales of our U.S. and Canada segment were $478.7 million in 2015, compared to $546.9 million in 2014, representing a decrease of $68.2 million, or 12.5%. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower unit sales given the difficult annual comparable with the relative strength of the performance of the Frozen and Marvel brands in 2014.\nInternational. Net sales of our International segment were $169.8 million in 2015, compared to $121.6 million in 2014, representing an increase of $48.2 million, or 39.6%. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the international expansion both in terms of markets with new offices in Mexico and Germany, as well as the increase of licensed rights for international markets.\nHalloween. Net sales of our Halloween segment were $97.2 million in 2015, compared to $141.6 million in 2014, representing a decrease of $44.4 million, or 31.4%. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower unit sales given the difficult annual comparable with the relative strength of the performance of the Frozen and Marvel brands in 2014.\nCost of Sales\nU.S. and Canada. Cost of sales of our U.S. and Canada segment was $335.0 million, or 70.0% of related net sales for 2015 compared to $384.5 million, or 70.3% of related net sales in 2014, representing a decrease of $49.5 million, or 12.9%. The decrease in the cost of sales is a direct function of lower unit sales. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales, year over year, is due to reduced costing of legacy products and product mix, partially offset by increased product tooling driven by new product introductions in 2015. Depreciation of molds and tools for the segment increased slightly in 2015 due to new product tooling driven by product introductions in 2015.\nInternational. Cost of sales of our International segment was $110.2 million, or 64.9% of related net sales for 2015 compared to $84.0 million, or 69.1% of related net sales in 2014, representing an increase of $26.2 million, or 31.2%. The increase in cost of sales is a direct function of higher overall unit sales. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales, year over year, is due to reduced costing of legacy products and product mix.\nHalloween. Cost of sales of our Halloween segment was $72.0 million, or 74.1% of related net sales for 2015 compared to $105.7 million, or 74.6% of related net sales in 2014, representing a decrease of $33.7 million, or 31.9%. The decrease in cost of sales is a direct function of lower overall unit sales. The decrease in cost of sales percentage was driven by better product costing on legacy items, stronger margins on new products in 2015 and the absence of lower selling prices of Marvel Halloween costumes in 2014.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $198.0 million in 2015 and $204.5 million in 2014, constituting 26.5% and 25.2% of net sales, respectively. The overall relative decrease of selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net Sales in 2015 is the result of the comparative decrease in net sales in 2015 compared to 2014. The overall decrease of $6.5 million is primarily due to lower advertising spend in 2015 partially offset by increased salaries and benefits in 2015 versus 2014.\nProfit from Video Game Joint Venture\nIn 2015, we recognized $2.7 million of income related to our former video game joint venture.\nIncome from Joint Ventures\nWe recognized $0.1 million of income for funds received in 2015 related to Pacific Animation Partners. In 2014, we recognized $0.3 million for funds received from Pacific Animation Partners.\nInterest Income\nInterest income in 2015 was $0.1 million, comparable to $0.1 million in 2014 due to lower cash balances in 2015 offset by a higher proportion of investible cash.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $12.4 million in 2015, as compared to $12.5 million in 2014. In 2015, we recorded interest expense of $11.5 million related to our convertible senior notes payable and $0.9 million related to our revolving credit facility. In 2014, we recorded interest expense of $11.3 million related to our convertible senior notes payable, $0.8 million related to our credit facility, $0.2 million of uncertain tax expense and $0.2 million related to the interest component of our Maui acquisition earn-out payment.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur income tax expense, which includes federal, state and foreign income taxes and discrete items, was $3.4 million, or an effective tax rate of 12.9% for 2015. During 2014, the income tax expense was $3.7 million, or an effective tax rate of 14.7%.\nThe 2015 tax expense of $3.4 million included a discrete tax expense of $0.9 million primarily comprised of return to provision adjustments. Absent these discrete tax expenses, our effective tax rate for 2015 was 9.5%, primarily due to a full valuation allowance on the Company's United States deferred tax assets and the foreign rate differential, and is impacted by the proportion of Hong Kong earnings to overall earnings and is expected to vary depending on the level of consolidated earnings.\nThe 2014 tax expense of $3.7 million included a discrete tax benefit of $0.3 million comprised of adjustments from closed tax audits (see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Absent these discrete tax expenses, our effective tax rate for 2014 was 13.6%, primarily due to a full valuation allowance on the Company's United States deferred tax assets and the foreign rate differential, and is impacted by the proportion of Hong Kong earnings to overall earnings and is expected to vary depending on the level of consolidated earnings.\nWe assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets by jurisdiction. For the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, we were in a cumulative pre-tax loss position in the U.S. On the basis of this evaluation, as of December 31, 2015, a valuation allowance of $100.9 million has been recorded against the U.S. deferred tax assets that more likely than not will not be realized. The net deferred tax liabilities of $2.3 million represent the net deferred tax liabilities in the foreign jurisdiction, where we are in a cumulative income position.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.3 million related to foreign jurisdictions.\nQuarterly Fluctuations and Seasonality\nWe have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipate these fluctuations in the future. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period. Our first quarter is typically expected to be the least profitable as a result of lower net sales but substantially similar fixed operating expenses. This is consistent with the performance of many companies in the toy industry.\nThe following table presents our unaudited quarterly results for the years indicated. The seasonality of our business is reflected in this quarterly presentation.\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr>

and 2016 and fourth quarter of 2016, experienced seasonally low sales which coupled with fixed overhead resulted in significant net losses.\nIn the third quarter of 2015, income of $5.6 million was recognized in connection with the change in fair value of the Maui acquisition liability.\nQuarterly and year-to-date computations of income (loss) per share amounts are made independently. Therefore, the sum of the per share amounts for the quarters may not agree with the per share amounts for the year.\nDebt with Conversion and Other Options\nIn July 2013, we sold an aggregate of $100.0 million principal amount of 4.25% convertible senior notes due 2018 (the 2018 Notes\u201d). The 2018 Notes, which are senior unsecured obligations, pay interest semi-annually in arrears on August 1 and February 1 of each year at a rate of 4.25% per annum and will mature on August 1, 2018. The initial and still conversion rate for the 2018 Notes is 114.3674 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $8.74 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment in certain events. Upon conversion, the 2018 Notes will be settled in shares of the Company's common stock. Holders of the 2018 Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or some of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the 2018 Notes). In 2016, we repurchased and retired $6.1 million principal amount of the 2018 Notes.\nIn June 2014, the Company sold an aggregate of $115.0 million principal amount of 4.875% convertible senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes\u201d). The 2020 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company paying interest semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year at a rate of 4.875% per annum and will mature on June 1, 2020. The initial and still conversion rate for the 2020 Notes is 103.7613 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $9.64 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment in certain events. Upon conversion, the 2020 Notes will be settled in shares of the Company's common stock. Holders of the 2020 Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or some of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the 2020 Notes). In 2016, we repurchased and retired $2.0 million principal amount of the 2020 Notes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had working capital of $236.6 million compared to $255.0 million as of December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to the repurchase of our common stock and convertible senior notes, offset in part by net income.\nOperating activities used net cash of $79.0 million and provided net cash of $65.8 million and $16.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Net cash was favorably impacted primarily by decreases in advance royalty payments and an increase in accounts payable, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory and a decrease in accrued expenses. Our accounts receivable turnover as measured by days sales for the quarter outstanding in accounts receivable was 83 days, 90 days, and 96 days as of December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Other than open purchase orders issued in the normal course of business, we have no obligations to purchase finished goods from our manufacturers. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $86.1 million.\nInvesting activities used net cash of $13.0 million, $21.7 million and $15.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Cash used in 2016 consisted primarily of $14.8 million cash paid for the purchase of office furniture, equipment and molds and tooling used in the manufacturing of our products. Cash used in 2015 consisted primarily of $17.8 million cash paid for leasehold improvements, the purchase of office furniture, equipment and molds and tooling used in the manufacturing of our products. Cash used in 2014 consisted primarily of $10.5 million cash paid for the purchase of office furniture, equipment and molds and tooling used in the manufacturing of our products. As part of our strategy to develop and market new products, we have entered into various character and product licenses with royalties generally ranging from 1% to 20% payable on net sales of such products. As of December 31, 2016, these agreements required future aggregate minimum guarantees of $92.3 million, exclusive of $13.8 million in advances already paid. Of this $92.3 million future minimum guarantee, $52.0 million is due over the next twelve months.\nFinancing activities provided net cash of $46.0 million and used net cash of $13.4 million and $12.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The cash used in 2016 consists primarily of the repurchase of our common stock and convertible senior notes.\nThe following is a summary of our significant contractual cash obligations for the periods indicated that existed as of December 31, 2016 and is based upon information appearing in the notes to the consolidated financial statements (in thousands):\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 - 3\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3 - 5\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More Than\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 206,865\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 206,865\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,440\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,640\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,080\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,030\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,698\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,236\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,184\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 45,148\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Minimum guaranteed license/royalty payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 51,950\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 40,315\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92,265\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employment contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,226\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13,109\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21,335\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 81,646\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 291,627\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,236\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,184\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 390,693\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above table excludes any potential uncertain income tax liabilities that may become payable upon examination of our income tax returns by taxing authorities. Such amounts and periods of payment cannot be reliably estimated. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further explanation of our uncertain tax positions.\nIn July 2012, we acquired all of the stock of Maui, Inc., an Ohio corporation, Kessler Services, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and A.S. Design Limited, a Hong Kong corporation (collectively, Maui\u201d). The initial cash consideration totaled $36.2 million. In addition, we agreed to pay an earn-out of up to an aggregate amount of $18.0 million in cash over the three calendar years following the acquisition based upon the achievement of certain financial performance criteria, which was accrued and recorded as goodwill as of December 31, 2012. All changes to the earn-out liability were charged to income. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, the earn-outs were not achieved and the related liability of $6.0 million, $5.9 million and $5.6 million, respectively, was reversed to other income. Maui is a leading manufacturer and distributor of spring and summer activity toys and impulse toys and was included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition.\nIn September 2012, we acquired all of the stock of JKID, LTD., a United Kingdom corporation for an initial cash consideration of $1.1 million and deferred cash payments of $5.5 million payable in five semi-annual payments of $1.1 million each. In addition, we agreed to pay compensation of up to an aggregate amount of $4.4 million in cash over the two year period of 2015 through 2016, based upon the achievement of certain financial performance criteria, which was to be charged to expense when earned. The financial performance criteria were not met in 2015 or 2016. Accordingly, none of the earn-out was paid. JKID is the developer of augmented reality technology that enhances the play patterns of toys and consumer products.\nIn October 2016, we acquired the operating assets of the C'est Moi brand of performance makeup and youth skincare products whose distribution is currently limited primarily to Asia. We expect to launch a full line of makeup and skincare products branded under the C'est Moi name in the U.S. and Canada in the fourth quarter of 2017 prior to which sales are anticipated to be nominal.\nIn November 2009, the Company sold an aggregate of $100.0 million principal amount of the 2014 Notes. The 2014 Notes, which were senior unsecured obligations of the Company, paid cash interest semi-annually at a rate of 4.50% per annum and matured on November 1, 2014. In July 2013, the Company repurchased an aggregate of $61.0 million principal amount of these notes at par plus accrued interest with a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of $100.0 million principal amount of 4.25% convertible senior notes due 2018 resulting in a gain on extinguishment of $0.1 million. The remainder of these notes were redeemed at par at maturity on November 1, 2014.\nWe believe that our cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our anticipated operating needs for at least the next 12 months. We expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $14.0 million in 2017. Although operating activities are expected to provide cash, to the extent we make any acquisitions or grow significantly in the future, our operating and investing activities may use cash and, consequently, any acquisitions or growth may require us to obtain additional sources of financing. There can be no assurance that any necessary additional financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We intend to finance our long-term liquidity requirements out of net cash provided by operations and net cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2016, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nWe have cumulative undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries outside the U.S. Should those earnings be repatriated to the U.S., we would incur additional tax expense. Other than for short-term financing needs of our U.S. parent company, we do not intend to repatriate those earnings to the U.S. The amount of cash and short term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries was $91.7 million and $72.2 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nDuring the last three fiscal years ending December 31, 2016, we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our net sales and revenues and on income from continuing operations.\nSubsequent Events\nDuring January and February 2017, the Company entered into exchange transactions with holders of its 4.25% convertible senior notes (due 2018) to exchange at par an aggregate of approximately $39.1 million principal amount of such notes for 2.9 million shares of its common stock and approximately $24.1 million in cash. After these exchanges, the remaining balance of the principal amount of the 2018 Notes was reduced to approximately $54.7 million.\nIn March 2017, we entered into an agreement with Hongkong Meisheng Culture Company Ltd. (\"Meisheng Culture Company\") to sell 3,660,891 shares of our common stock to Meisheng Culture Company for a total purchase price of $19.3 million. The transaction is subject to approval by the shareholders of Meisheng Culture Company's parent company (Meisheng Culture & Creative Corp., Ltd.), and regulatory filings in China by Meisheng Culture Company. Meisheng Culture & Creative Corp., Ltd. is one of our joint venture partners (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nExchange Rates\nSales from our United States and Hong Kong operations are denominated in U.S. dollars and our manufacturing costs are denominated in either U.S. or Hong Kong dollars. Local sales (other than in Hong Kong) and operating expenses of our operations in Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain, Canada, Mexico and China are denominated in local currency, thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates. Changes in the various exchange rates against the U.S. dollar may positively or negatively affect our operating results. The exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar has been fixed by the Hong Kong government since 1983 at HK$7.80 to US$1.00 and, accordingly, has not represented a currency exchange risk to the U.S. dollar. We cannot assure you that the exchange rate between the United States and Hong Kong currencies will continue to be fixed or that exchange rate fluctuations between the United States and Hong Kong or all other currencies will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "summary": "The Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements, with risks and uncertainties.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. You should read this section in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes (included in Item 8).\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplementary information were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8. Inherent in the application of many of these accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates and judgments in the determination of certain revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. As such, materially different financial results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. The policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operations and financial position include:\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon management's assessment of the business environment, customers' financial condition, historical collection experience, accounts receivable aging, customer disputes and the collectability of specific customer accounts. If there were a deterioration of a major customer's creditworthiness, or actual defaults were higher than our historical experience, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is also affected by the time at which uncollectible accounts receivable balances are actually written off.\nMajor customers' accounts are monitored on an ongoing basis; more in-depth reviews are performed based upon changes in a customer's financial condition and/or the level of credit being extended. When a significant event occurs, such as a bankruptcy filing by a specific customer, and on a quarterly basis, the allowance is reviewed for adequacy and the balance or accrual rate is adjusted to reflect current risk prospects.\nRevenue Recognition. Our revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title transfer has occurred (product shipment), the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Sales are recorded net of sales returns and discounts, which are estimated at the time of shipment based upon historical data. JAKKS routinely enters into arrangements with its customers to provide sales incentives and support customer promotions and we provide allowances for returns and defective merchandise. Such programs are primarily based upon customer purchases, customer performance of specified promotional activities and other specified factors such as sales to consumers. Accruals for these programs are recorded as sales adjustments that reduce gross revenue in the period the related revenue is recognized.\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level.\nFactors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following:\n\nDue to the subjective nature of the impairment analysis, significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimate could materially affect the conclusion regarding the future cash flows necessary to support the valuation of long-lived assets, including goodwill. The valuation of goodwill involves a high degree of judgment and uncertainty related to our key assumptions. Any changes in our key projections or estimates could result in a reporting unit either passing or failing the first step of the impairment model, which could significantly change the amount of any impairment ultimately recorded.\nBased upon the assumptions underlying the valuation, impairment is determined by estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing that value to the reporting unit's book value. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually. If the implied fair value is more than the book value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is not indicated. If impairment exists, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of its assets and liabilities excluding goodwill, with the excess amount representing the fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the book value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of that goodwill.\nThe Company assessed its goodwill for impairment as of April 1, 2016 for each of its reporting units by evaluating qualitative factors, including, but not limited to, the performance of each reporting unit, general economic conditions, access to capital, the industry and competitive environment, the interest rate environment. In prior years, the assessment had been performed as of October 1 of each year, however, as of March 31, 2016, the Company revised its reportable segments based on changes to how the businesses are managed and how resources are allocated to the businesses. In conjunction with the required reallocation of goodwill to the new reportable segments as of March 31, 2016, the Company performed its annual assessment as of April 1, 2016. Based on the seasonality of its businesses, the Company has determined that it is most appropriate to perform future annual assessments as of April 1 after completion of the business cycles of each of its reporting units. The Company prepared step-one of its impairment model. Based on the Company's assessment, it determined that the fair values of its reporting units were not less than the carrying amounts. In addition, as a result of operating performance below expectations for the full year of 2016 that became apparent in December 2016, the Company performed a subsequent impairment assessment on goodwill as of December 31, 2016. Based on the Company's assessment, it determined that the fair values of its reporting units were not less than the carrying amounts with excess coverage of fair value over the carrying value of each of the reporting units of 2.0%, 20.6% and 2.0% for U.S. and Canada, International, and Halloween, respectively. As such, the Company determined there was no impairment to be recorded in 2016. The amount of goodwill assigned to each of the three reporting units, U.S. and Canada, International, and Halloween, amounted to $29.5 million, $11.5 million, and $2.2 million, respectively.\nGoodwill and intangible assets amounted to $78.9 million as of December 31, 2016.\nReserve for Inventory Obsolescence. We value our inventory at the lower of cost or market. Based upon a consideration of quantities on hand, actual and projected sales volume, anticipated product selling prices and product lines planned to be discontinued, slow-moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its net realizable value.\nFailure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in us under-producing popular items or overproducing less popular items. Furthermore, significant changes in demand for our products would impact management's estimates in establishing our inventory provision.\nManagement estimates are monitored on a quarterly basis and a further adjustment to reduce inventory to its net realizable value is recorded, as an increase to cost of sales, when deemed necessary under the lower of cost or market standard.\nIncome Allocation for Income Taxes. Our annual income tax provision and related income tax assets and liabilities are based upon actual income as allocated to the various tax jurisdictions based upon our transfer pricing study, US and foreign statutory income tax rates and tax regulations and planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in interpreting tax regulations in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, and in evaluating worldwide uncertain tax positions. Actual results could differ materially from those judgments, and changes from such judgments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome taxes and interest and penalties related to income tax payable. We do not file a consolidated return for our foreign subsidiaries. We file federal and state returns and our foreign subsidiaries each file returns in their respective jurisdictions, as applicable. Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized as deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\nWe must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. We consider all available positive and negative evidence when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in previous periods and our forecast of future taxable income. We believe this to be a critical accounting policy because should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not likely, as well as decrease in the period in which the assessment of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets reverses, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nWe accrue a tax reserve for additional income taxes and interest, which may become payable in future years as a result of audit adjustments by tax authorities. The reserve is based upon management's assessment of all relevant information and is periodically reviewed and adjusted as circumstances warrant. As of December 31, 2016, our income tax reserves were approximately $2.3 million and relates to the potential tax settlement in Hong Kong, adjustments in the area of withholding taxes, and state taxes.\nWe recognize current period interest expense and the reversal of previously recognized interest expense that has been determined to not be assessable due to the expiration of the related audit period or other compelling factors on the income tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense, and penalties and penalty reversals related to the income taxes payable as other expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nShare-Based Compensation. We grant restricted stock and options to purchase our common stock to our employees (including officers) and non-employee directors under our 2002 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the Plan\u201d), which incorporated the shares remaining under our Third Amended and Restated 1995 Stock Option Plan. The benefits provided under the Plan are share-based payments. Related to the stock option grants, we estimate the value of share-based awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, cancellations, terminations, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. Related to the restricted stock award grants, we determine the value of each award based on the market value of the underlying common stock at the date of each grant and expense each award over the stipulated service period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard in 2018.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory\u201d ( ASU 2015-11\u201d). ASU 2015-11 requires inventory accounted for under the FIFO or average cost method to be measured using the lower of cost and net realizable value. The amendments are effective prospectively for fiscal years and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2015-11 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\u201d ( ASU 2016-01\u201d). The new guidance is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently assessing the potential impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases\u201d ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We are currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\u201d ( ASU 2016-09\u201d) which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payments, including income tax consequences and classification on the statement of cash flows. Under the new standard, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies will be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. Additionally, excess tax benefits will be classified as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows. In regard to forfeitures, the entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize forfeitures as they occur or estimate the number of awards expected to be forfeited. The guidance in ASU 2016-09 is effective for the fiscal year, and interim periods within that fiscal year, beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.\u201d The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory.\u201d The amendments in this ASU reduces the complexity in the accounting standards by allowing the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. Historically, recognition of the income tax consequence was not recognized until the asset was sold to an outside party. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain statement of operations data as a percentage of net sales.\n\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, certain income statement data by segment (in thousands).\n\nAs of March 31, 2016 the Company realigned its segments to align more closely with how management evaluates the business performance of the Company. The products included in the realigned segments are detailed in Part I, Item 1 of the Company's 10-K report. Prior period results have been conformed to the new segment reporting structure.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nNet Sales\nU.S. and Canada. Net sales of our U.S. and Canada segment were $478.6 million in 2016, compared to $478.7 million in 2015, representing a decrease of $0.1 million. Net sales were flat year-over year primarily due to a decrease in unit sales of various products due to the suspension of shipments to a major U.S. customer and lower than expected unit sales of some movie licensed products, offset by higher unit sales of our Disney Tsum Tsum line of collectibles, Disney Princess and Alice Through the Looking Glass dolls, kids furniture and accessories, and our Big Figs line.\nInternational. Net sales of our International segment were $131.2 million in 2016, compared to $169.8 million in 2015, representing a decrease of $38.6 million, or 22.7%. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by declines in unit sales of various products in the United Kingdom and Western Europe due to the reduced buying power of our customers stemming from the devaluation of the British Pound, and lower than expected unit sales of movie licensed product.\nHalloween. Net sales of our Halloween segment were $96.8 million in 2016, compared to $97.2 million in 2015, representing a decrease of $0.4 million, or 0.4%. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to a decrease in unit sales of a variety of products in 2016.\nCost of Sales\nU.S. and Canada. Cost of sales of our U.S. and Canada segment was $322.7 million, or 67.4% of related net sales in 2016 compared to $335.0 million, or 70.0% of related net sales in 2015, representing a decrease of $12.3 million, or 3.7%. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales, year over year, is due to reduced costing of legacy products and product mix, partially offset by increased product tooling driven by new product introductions in 2016. Depreciation of molds and tools for the segment increased slightly in 2016 due to new product tooling driven by product introductions in 2016.\nInternational. Cost of sales of our International segment was $89.2 million, or 68.0% of related net sales in 2016 compared to $110.2 million, or 64.9% of related net sales in 2015, representing a decrease of $21.0 million, or 19.1%. The decrease in cost of sales is a direct function of lower overall unit sales. The increase as a percentage of net sales, year-over-year, is due to the change in product mix to relatively higher cost product and an increase in the average royalty rate. The increase in royalties is driven by a shift in the product mix to products with relatively higher royalty rates and an increase in royalty rates on shipments made FOB China. Our depreciation of molds and tools for the segment showed a modest increase from 2015 due to increased product tooling driven by new product introductions in 2016.\nHalloween. Cost of sales of our Halloween segment was $71.7 million, or 74.1% of related net sales for 2016 compared to $72.0 million, or 74.1% of related net sales in 2015, representing a decrease of $0.3 million, or 0.4%. The percentage of net sales in 2016 is comparable to 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $205.9 million in 2016 and $198.0 million in 2015, constituting 29.1% and 26.5% of net sales, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $7.9 million driven by higher marketing expenses ($6.7 million), higher product development costs in support of increased product launches ($2.5 million), and increased depreciation and amortization ($1.6 million), partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses ($2.9 million).\nProfit from Video Game Joint Venture\nWe recognized $0.2 million of income for funds received in 2016 related to our former video game joint venture in partial settlement of amounts owed to the Company when our joint venture partner was liquidated pursuant to their 2012 bankruptcy filing. In 2015, we recognized $2.7 million in income related to our former video game joint venture. It is not known if any additional funds will be received by us.\nIncome from Joint Ventures\nWe recognized $0.7 million of income for funds received in 2016 related to Pacific Animation Partners compared to $0.1 million received in 2015.\nOther Income\nWe recognized income of $0.2 million for funds received in 2016 related to the disgorgement of short swing trading profits from a shareholder, net of legal fees and a $0.1 million gain on extinguishment of convertible senior notes.\nInterest Income\nInterest income in 2016 was $0.1 million, comparable to $0.1 million in 2015.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $13.0 million in 2016, as compared to $12.4 million in 2015. In 2016, we recorded interest expense of $11.7 million related to our convertible senior notes payable, $0.9 million related to our revolving credit facility and $0.4 million related to the interest component of our Maui acquisition earn-out. In 2015, we recorded interest expense of $11.5 million related to our convertible senior notes payable and $0.9 million related to our revolving credit facility.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur income tax expense, which includes federal, state and foreign income taxes and discrete items, was $4.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 76.8% for 2016. During 2015, the income tax expense was $3.4 million, or an effective tax rate of 12.9%.\nThe 2016 tax expense of $4.1 million included a discrete tax benefit of $0.1 million primarily comprised of return to provision adjustments. Absent these discrete tax benefits, our effective tax rate for 2016 was 79.2%, primarily due to US federal alternative minimum tax, various state taxes and taxes on foreign income.\nThe 2015 tax expense of $3.4 million included a discrete tax expense of $0.9 million primarily comprised of return to provision adjustments. Absent these discrete tax expenses, our effective tax rate for 2015 was 9.5%, primarily due to a full valuation allowance on the Company's United States deferred tax assets and the foreign rate differential, and is impacted by the proportion of Hong Kong earnings to overall earnings and is expected to vary depending on the level of consolidated earnings.\nWe assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets by jurisdiction. Based on our evaluation of all positive and negative evidence, as of December 31, 2016, a valuation allowance of $49.3 million has been recorded against the deferred tax assets that more likely than not will not be realized. The net deferred tax liabilities of $2.0 million represent the net deferred tax liabilities in the foreign jurisdiction, where we are in a cumulative income position.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.0 million related to foreign jurisdictions.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nNet Sales\nU.S. and Canada. Net sales of our U.S. and Canada segment were $478.7 million in 2015, compared to $546.9 million in 2014, representing a decrease of $68.2", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. You should read this section in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes (included in Item 8).\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplementary information were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8. Inherent in the application of many of these accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates and judgments in the determination of certain revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. As such, materially different financial results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. The policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operations and financial position include:\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon management's assessment of the business environment, customers' financial condition, historical collection experience, accounts receivable aging, customer disputes and the collectability of specific customer accounts. If there were a deterioration of a major customer's creditworthiness, or actual defaults were higher than our historical experience, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is also affected by the time at which uncollectible accounts receivable balances are actually written off.\nMajor customers' accounts are monitored on an ongoing basis; more in-depth reviews are performed based upon changes in a customer's financial condition and/or the level of credit being extended. When a significant event occurs, such as a bankruptcy filing by a specific customer, and on a quarterly basis, the allowance is reviewed for adequacy and the balance or accrual rate is adjusted to reflect current risk prospects.\nRevenue Recognition. Our revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title transfer has occurred (product shipment), the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Sales are recorded net of sales returns and discounts, which are estimated at the time of shipment based upon historical data. JAKKS routinely enters into arrangements with its customers to provide sales incentives and support customer promotions and we provide allowances for returns and defective merchandise. Such programs are primarily based upon customer purchases, customer performance of specified promotional activities and other specified factors such as sales to consumers. Accruals for these programs are recorded as sales adjustments that reduce gross revenue in the period the related revenue is recognized.\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level.\nFactors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> significant negative industry or economic trends.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDue to the subjective nature of the impairment analysis, significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimate could materially affect the conclusion regarding the future cash flows necessary to support the valuation of long-lived assets, including goodwill. The valuation of goodwill involves a high degree of judgment and uncertainty related to our key assumptions. Any changes in our key projections or estimates could result in a reporting unit either passing or failing the first step of the impairment model, which could significantly change the amount of any impairment ultimately recorded.\nBased upon the assumptions underlying the valuation, impairment is determined by estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing that value to the reporting unit's book value. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually. If the implied fair value is more than the book value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is not indicated. If impairment exists, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of its assets and liabilities excluding goodwill, with the excess amount representing the fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the book value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of that goodwill.\nThe Company assessed its goodwill for impairment as of April 1, 2016 for each of its reporting units by evaluating qualitative factors, including, but not limited to, the performance of each reporting unit, general economic conditions, access to capital, the industry and competitive environment, the interest rate environment. In prior years, the assessment had been performed as of October 1 of each year, however, as of March 31, 2016, the Company revised its reportable segments based on changes to how the businesses are managed and how resources are allocated to the businesses. In conjunction with the required reallocation of goodwill to the new reportable segments as of March 31, 2016, the Company performed its annual assessment as of April 1, 2016. Based on the seasonality of its businesses, the Company has determined that it is most appropriate to perform future annual assessments as of April 1 after completion of the business cycles of each of its reporting units. The Company prepared step-one of its impairment model. Based on the Company's assessment, it determined that the fair values of its reporting units were not less than the carrying amounts. In addition, as a result of operating performance below expectations for the full year of 2016 that became apparent in December 2016, the Company performed a subsequent impairment assessment on goodwill as of December 31, 2016. Based on the Company's assessment, it determined that the fair values of its reporting units were not less than the carrying amounts with excess coverage of fair value over the carrying value of each of the reporting units of 2.0%, 20.6% and 2.0% for U.S. and Canada, International, and Halloween, respectively. As such, the Company determined there was no impairment to be recorded in 2016. The amount of goodwill assigned to each of the three reporting units, U.S. and Canada, International, and Halloween, amounted to $29.5 million, $11.5 million, and $2.2 million, respectively.\nGoodwill and intangible assets amounted to $78.9 million as of December 31, 2016.\nReserve for Inventory Obsolescence. We value our inventory at the lower of cost or market. Based upon a consideration of quantities on hand, actual and projected sales volume, anticipated product selling prices and product lines planned to be discontinued, slow-moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its net realizable value.\nFailure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in us under-producing popular items or overproducing less popular items. Furthermore, significant changes in demand for our products would impact management's estimates in establishing our inventory provision.\nManagement estimates are monitored on a quarterly basis and a further adjustment to reduce inventory to its net realizable value is recorded, as an increase to cost of sales, when deemed necessary under the lower of cost or market standard.\nIncome Allocation for Income Taxes. Our annual income tax provision and related income tax assets and liabilities are based upon actual income as allocated to the various tax jurisdictions based upon our transfer pricing study, US and foreign statutory income tax rates and tax regulations and planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in interpreting tax regulations in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, and in evaluating worldwide uncertain tax positions. Actual results could differ materially from those judgments, and changes from such judgments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome taxes and interest and penalties related to income tax payable. We do not file a consolidated return for our foreign subsidiaries. We file federal and state returns and our foreign subsidiaries each file returns in their respective jurisdictions, as applicable. Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized as deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\nWe must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. We consider all available positive and negative evidence when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in previous periods and our forecast of future taxable income. We believe this to be a critical accounting policy because should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not likely, as well as decrease in the period in which the assessment of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets reverses, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nWe accrue a tax reserve for additional income taxes and interest, which may become payable in future years as a result of audit adjustments by tax authorities. The reserve is based upon management's assessment of all relevant information and is periodically reviewed and adjusted as circumstances warrant. As of December 31, 2016, our income tax reserves were approximately $2.3 million and relates to the potential tax settlement in Hong Kong, adjustments in the area of withholding taxes, and state taxes.\nWe recognize current period interest expense and the reversal of previously recognized interest expense that has been determined to not be assessable due to the expiration of the related audit period or other compelling factors on the income tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense, and penalties and penalty reversals related to the income taxes payable as other expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nShare-Based Compensation. We grant restricted stock and options to purchase our common stock to our employees (including officers) and non-employee directors under our 2002 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the Plan\u201d), which incorporated the shares remaining under our Third Amended and Restated 1995 Stock Option Plan. The benefits provided under the Plan are share-based payments. Related to the stock option grants, we estimate the value of share-based awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, cancellations, terminations, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. Related to the restricted stock award grants, we determine the value of each award based on the market value of the underlying common stock at the date of each grant and expense each award over the stipulated service period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.

The products included in the realigned segments are detailed in Part I, Item 1 of the Company's 10-K report. Prior period results have been conformed to the new segment reporting structure.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nNet Sales\nU.S. and Canada. Net sales of our U.S. and Canada segment were $478.6 million in 2016, compared to $478.7 million in 2015, representing a decrease of $0.1 million. Net sales were flat year-over year primarily due to a decrease in unit sales of various products due to the suspension of shipments to a major U.S. customer and lower than expected unit sales of some movie licensed products, offset by higher unit sales of our Disney Tsum Tsum line of collectibles, Disney Princess and Alice Through the Looking Glass dolls, kids furniture and accessories, and our Big Figs line.\nInternational. Net sales of our International segment were $131.2 million in 2016, compared to $169.8 million in 2015, representing a decrease of $38.6 million, or 22.7%. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by declines in unit sales of various products in the United Kingdom and Western Europe due to the reduced buying power of our customers stemming from the devaluation of the British Pound, and lower than expected unit sales of movie licensed product.\nHalloween. Net sales of our Halloween segment were $96.8 million in 2016, compared to $97.2 million in 2015, representing a decrease of $0.4 million, or 0.4%. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to a decrease in unit sales of a variety of products in 2016.\nCost of Sales\nU.S. and Canada. Cost of sales of our U.S. and Canada segment was $322.7 million, or 67.4% of related net sales in 2016 compared to $335.0 million, or 70.0% of related net sales in 2015, representing a decrease of $12.3 million, or 3.7%. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales, year over year, is due to reduced costing of legacy products and product mix, partially offset by increased product tooling driven by new product introductions in 2016. Depreciation of molds and tools for the segment increased slightly in 2016 due to new product tooling driven by product introductions in 2016.\nInternational. Cost of sales of our International segment was $89.2 million, or 68.0% of related net sales in 2016 compared to $110.2 million, or 64.9% of related net sales in 2015, representing a decrease of $21.0 million, or 19.1%. The decrease in cost of sales is a direct function of lower overall unit sales. The increase as a percentage of net sales, year-over-year, is due to the change in product mix to relatively higher cost product and an increase in the average royalty rate. The increase in royalties is driven by a shift in the product mix to products with relatively higher royalty rates and an increase in royalty rates on shipments made FOB China. Our depreciation of molds and tools for the segment showed a modest increase from 2015 due to increased product tooling driven by new product introductions in 2016.\nHalloween. Cost of sales of our Halloween segment was $71.7 million, or 74.1% of related net sales for 2016 compared to $72.0 million, or 74.1% of related net sales in 2015, representing a decrease of $0.3 million, or 0.4%. The percentage of net sales in 2016 is comparable to 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $205.9 million in 2016 and $198.0 million in 2015, constituting 29.1% and 26.5% of net sales, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $7.9 million driven by higher marketing expenses ($6.7 million), higher product development costs in support of increased product launches ($2.5 million), and increased depreciation and amortization ($1.6 million), partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses ($2.9 million).\nProfit from Video Game Joint Venture\nWe recognized $0.2 million of income for funds received in 2016 related to our former video game joint venture in partial settlement of amounts owed to the Company when our joint venture partner was liquidated pursuant to their 2012 bankruptcy filing. In 2015, we recognized $2.7 million in income related to our former video game joint venture. It is not known if any additional funds will be received by us.\nIncome from Joint Ventures\nWe recognized $0.7 million of income for funds received in 2016 related to Pacific Animation Partners compared to $0.1 million received in 2015.\nOther Income\nWe recognized income of $0.2 million for funds received in 2016 related to the disgorgement of short swing trading profits from a shareholder, net of legal fees and a $0.1 million gain on extinguishment of convertible senior notes.\nInterest Income\nInterest income in 2016 was $0.1 million, comparable to $0.1 million in 2015.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $13.0 million in 2016, as compared to $12.4 million in 2015. In 2016, we recorded interest expense of $11.7 million related to our convertible senior notes payable, $0.9 million related to our revolving credit facility and $0.4 million related to the interest component of our Maui acquisition earn-out. In 2015, we recorded interest expense of $11.5 million related to our convertible senior notes payable and $0.9 million related to our revolving credit facility.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur income tax expense, which includes federal, state and foreign income taxes and discrete items, was $4.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 76.8% for 2016. During 2015, the income tax expense was $3.4 million, or an effective tax rate of 12.9%.\nThe 2016 tax expense of $4.1 million included a discrete tax benefit of $0.1 million primarily comprised of return to provision adjustments. Absent these discrete tax benefits, our effective tax rate for 2016 was 79.2%, primarily due to US federal alternative minimum tax, various state taxes and taxes on foreign income.\nThe 2015 tax expense of $3.4 million included a discrete tax expense of $0.9 million primarily comprised of return to provision adjustments. Absent these discrete tax expenses, our effective tax rate for 2015 was 9.5%, primarily due to a full valuation allowance on the Company's United States deferred tax assets and the foreign rate differential, and is impacted by the proportion of Hong Kong earnings to overall earnings and is expected to vary depending on the level of consolidated earnings.\nWe assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets by jurisdiction. Based on our evaluation of all positive and negative evidence, as of December 31, 2016, a valuation allowance of $49.3 million has been recorded against the deferred tax assets that more likely than not will not be realized. The net deferred tax liabilities of $2.0 million represent the net deferred tax liabilities in the foreign jurisdiction, where we are in a cumulative income position.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.0 million related to foreign jurisdictions.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nNet Sales\nU.S. and Canada. Net sales of our U.S. and Canada segment were $478.7 million in 2015, compared to $546.9 million in 2014, representing a decrease of $68.2"}
