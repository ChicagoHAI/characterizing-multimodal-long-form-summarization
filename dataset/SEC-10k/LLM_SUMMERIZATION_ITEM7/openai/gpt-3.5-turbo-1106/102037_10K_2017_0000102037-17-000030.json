Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to enhance the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, Part I, Item 1, Business\u201d and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d For information on risks and uncertainties related to our business that may make past performance not indicative of future results, or cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, see General,\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nOVERVIEW\nWe are the leading global leaf tobacco supplier. We derive most of our revenues from sales of processed tobacco to manufacturers of tobacco products throughout the world and from fees and commissions for specific services. We hold a strategic position in the world leaf markets where we work closely with both our customers and farmers to ensure that we deliver a compliant product that meets our customers' needs while promoting a strong supplier base. We adapt to meet changes in customer requirements as well as broader changes in the leaf markets, while continuing to provide the stability of supply and high level of service that distinguishes us in the marketplace. We believe that we have successfully met the needs of both our customers and suppliers while adapting to changes in leaf markets. Over the last three fiscal years, we have generated over $660 million in net cash flow from operations, invested over $145 million in our businesses, settled the mandatory conversion of our Series B 6.75% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (\"Series B Preferred Stock\") for about $178 million in cash, and returned over $210 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.\nWe have also faced challenging market conditions over the last three fiscal years. In fiscal year 2015, declines in some of our customers' sales volumes in the U.S. and Western European markets, partially due to weak economic conditions, reduced demand for leaf tobacco. At the same time, crops sold in fiscal year 2015 were larger than those sold in fiscal year 2014. Given fiscal year 2015's oversupplied market conditions, we were pleased with the results we achieved. We ended the year with strong fourth quarter results, which helped to bring our segment operating earnings for the fiscal year in line with our expectations. We also realized higher margins and maintained our solid financial position. We believe that our performance that year demonstrated our ability to execute well on our objective of delivering a compliant product in an efficient manner to our customers, under challenging circumstances.\nWe achieved improved results in fiscal year 2016, after managing through a second year of oversupplied market conditions. As anticipated, we ended the year with strong fourth quarter volumes, primarily driven by later timing of customer shipping orders in Brazil and Asia, and the positive change in leaf supply arrangements in our North America segment. We also achieved modest growth in overall volumes for the full fiscal year and improved our margins, and our selling, general, and administrative costs were lower. Our inventories continued to be well-managed, and uncommitted stocks declined from fiscal year 2015's level, in line with our target.\nWe delivered solid results again in fiscal year 2017 despite supply headwinds, most notably from the weather-reduced crop sizes in Brazil and ongoing challenging market conditions in Tanzania. Although we had anticipated ending the year with slightly lower volumes, earlier shipment timing as well as attractive green prices in some origins resulting in some additional purchases by our customers boosted shipments later in our fiscal year, allowing us to improve our market share and achieve lamina sales volumes that were slightly above those of the prior fiscal year.\nOur segment operating income for the 2017 fiscal year was also improved, primarily attributable to a reduction in selling, general, and administrative costs and earlier receipt of distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries. We believe that our success reflects our continuing efforts to bring efficiencies to the leaf tobacco supply chain. Through the hard work of our dedicated employees around the world, we have been able to expand services that we provide our customers and, despite continuing slow decline in demand for consumer tobacco products, maintain our volumes handled.\nWe also maintained our strong balance sheet in fiscal year 2017, and our lower working capital requirements from smaller crops and prudent buying programs helped us to retain the necessary cash reserves to support our working capital needs in fiscal year 2018. In addition, in fiscal year 2017, we continued our focus on providing returns to our shareholders through completion of the conversion of our preferred stock, increasing the common dividend rate, and returning more than $60 million in dividends.\nAs we move into fiscal year 2018, we are forecasting that global flue-cured tobacco production outside of China will increase by about 9%, largely from the recovery of the Brazilian crop due to better weather conditions there, and that burley tobacco production will decrease by approximately 8%, primarily due to reductions in Africa. Although it is too early to determine whether the additional purchases by customers in fiscal year 2017 may impact their requirements in fiscal year 2018, we continue to strive to be our customers' supplier of choice, providing them compliant products and quality services at a competitive price.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAmounts described as net income and earnings per diluted share in the following discussion are attributable to Universal Corporation and exclude earnings related to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries. The total for segment operating income referred to in the discussion below is a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We have provided a reconciliation of the total for segment operating income to consolidated operating income in Note 14. \"Operating Segments\" to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. We evaluate our segment performance excluding certain significant charges or credits. We believe this measure, which excludes these items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, provides investors with important information that is useful in understanding our business results and trends.\nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2017, Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2016\nNet income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, was $106.3 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, compared with fiscal year 2016's net income of $109.0 million, or $3.92 per diluted share. The fiscal year 2017 results included a one-time reduction of earnings available to common shareholders of $74.4 million, or $2.99 per diluted share, for purposes of determining the amounts reported for basic and diluted earnings per share, from the conversion for cash of the remaining outstanding shares of our Series B 6.75% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock under the mandatory conversion in January 2017. That one-time reduction and certain other non-recurring items are detailed in Other Items below. Excluding those items, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year of $3.97 increased $0.07 compared to the same period last year. Operating income of $178.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, was down $3.3 million compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. Segment operating income, which excludes non-recurring items, was $188.5 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $2.4 million from the prior year, primarily attributable to improved results for the North America segment, partly offset by a decline for the Other Tobacco Operations segment. Revenues of $2.1 billion for fiscal year 2017 were relatively flat compared with the previous year, as the slightly higher volumes and a benefit from earlier receipt of distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries were offset by lower green leaf costs and lower processing revenues.\nFlue-cured and Burley Leaf Tobacco Operations\nOther Regions\nOperating income for the Other Regions segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, of $143.3 million, was nearly flat, down only $0.3 million compared to $143.6 million in the previous fiscal year. Total volumes for the segment declined, but overall margins improved, benefitting from lower selling, general, and administrative expenses and timing of receipt of distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries. Africa volumes were slightly lower, reflecting challenging market conditions in Tanzania which offset volume improvements in other origins. South America's results were down, continuing the trend noted throughout the fiscal year from lower volumes and higher factory unit costs as a result of the reduced buying program and lower third-party processing volumes there this year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the segment were down significantly for the fiscal year on several items, including the favorable comparison to costs incurred in fiscal year 2016 to settle challenges regarding property rights and valuation of forestry land in South America, the reversal of value-added tax reserves, lower net foreign currency and exchange remeasurement losses, and a reduction in provisions for supplier advances compared to the previous fiscal year. Revenues for the segment were down about $116.0 million to $1.4 billion, on the lower sales volumes at lower average green leaf prices and lower processing revenues, offset in part by increased distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries.\nNorth America\nOperating income for the North America segment was $35.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, up $4.0 million compared with the previous year. Earnings improvements were driven mainly by higher sales volumes, partially due to earlier timing of current crop shipments in fiscal 2017. However, margins for the year were lower from a less favorable product mix, as well as reduced factory yields on weather affected U.S. crops. Fiscal year 2017 revenues for the segment increased by $54.6 million to $416.4 million compared to the previous fiscal year, on those higher sales volumes, at lower green leaf prices, and a less favorable product mix.\nOther Tobacco Operations\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, the Other Tobacco Operations segment operating income decreased by $1.3 million to $10.0 million compared with the same period last year. Earnings improved modestly for the dark tobacco operations as higher domestic volumes were largely offset by a less favorable sales mix and higher inventory write-downs this year. Results from the oriental joint venture also improved for the period mainly on favorable comparisons due to tax accruals in the prior year. Those improvements were outweighed by higher losses in the special services group, primarily for the new food ingredients business. Higher selling, general, and administrative costs for the segment also contributed to the declines. Revenues for the segment were up by $12.2 million to $231.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2017, mostly due to increased volumes from the timing of shipments of oriental tobaccos into the United States compared to the previous year.\nOther Items\nCost of goods sold decreased by about 2% to $1.7 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The decline was consistent with a comparable percentage decline in revenues, mostly as a result of lower green leaf prices. Selling, general, and administrative costs decreased by $14.7 million, or 6%, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, compared with the prior fiscal year. The decline in fiscal year 2017 was mainly due to the favorable comparison to costs incurred in fiscal year 2016 to settle challenges regarding property rights and valuation of forestry land in South America, the reversal of value-added tax reserves, and lower net foreign currency and exchange remeasurement losses compared to the previous fiscal year.\nThe consolidated effective income tax rates were approximately 34% and 32% for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Income taxes in both fiscal years were lower than the 35% federal statutory rate on a combination of lower net effective tax rates on income from certain foreign subsidiaries, and effects of changes in local currency exchange rates on deferred income tax balances, mainly in Brazil.\nIn December 2016, 111,072 shares of the Series B 6.75% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock were converted into approximately 2.5 million shares of our common stock. In January 2017, we announced a mandatory conversion of all 107,418 remaining outstanding shares of the preferred stock after meeting the requirements to initiate the mandatory conversion under the original terms of the preferred shares. We chose to satisfy the conversion obligation for the mandatory conversion in cash. Although the conversions of the preferred stock into common stock or for cash did not impact net income, the shares converted for cash under the mandatory conversion in January 2017 resulted in a one-time reduction of retained earnings of approximately $74.4 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2017, representing the excess of the conversion cost over the carrying value of those shares. The reduction in retained earnings resulted in a corresponding one-time reduction of earnings available to common shareholders for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 for purposes of determining the amounts reported for basic and diluted earnings per share. The effect of the mandatory conversion on diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, was ($2.99).\nResults for the year ended March 31, 2017, also included restructuring and impairment costs of $4.4 million ($0.10 per diluted share). Results for the year ended March 31, 2016, included restructuring and impairment costs of $2.4 million ($0.06 per diluted share) and a gain of $3.4 million ($0.08 per diluted share) on remeasuring our interest in a tobacco processing joint venture to fair value upon acquiring our partner's 50% ownership in the third fiscal quarter.\nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2016, Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2015\nNet income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, was $109.0 million, or $3.92 per diluted share, compared with net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, of $114.6 million, or $4.06 per diluted share. Those results included certain non-recurring items, detailed in Other Items below, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.02 and $0.46 for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding those items in both years, net income for fiscal year 2016 increased $6.8 million ($0.30 per diluted share) compared to the same period in fiscal year 2015. Segment operating income, which excludes those items, was $186.1 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $18.8 million, or 11%, from fiscal year 2015. That improvement was primarily attributable to a reduction in selling, general, and administrative costs, as well as improved gross margins on fiscal year 2016's modestly higher sales volumes. Revenues of $2.1 billion for fiscal year 2016 declined 7% compared with fiscal year 2015, driven mainly by lower green leaf costs and lower processing revenues, partly mitigated by the increase in volumes.\nFlue-cured and Burley Leaf Tobacco Operations\nOther Regions\nOperating income for the Other Regions segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, was $143.6 million, up 14% compared to $125.8 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Better margins, fewer inventory write-downs, and lower selling, general, and administrative expenses drove the earnings improvement. These positive factors outweighed lower margins in Europe and the currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. dollar which negatively impacted results from that region. Strong volumes in most regions were offset by declines in Africa on smaller crop sizes in some origins compared to fiscal year 2015. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the segment were down significantly for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, largely on reductions in local currency-denominated expenses from devaluation of foreign currencies, mainly in South America and Africa, and lower incentive compensation costs. Revenues for the segment were down about 12% to $1.5 billion, driven mostly by lower average green leaf prices and the modestly reduced volumes.\nNorth America\nOperating income for the North America segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, of $31.1 million was flat compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Earnings improvements from sales volume increases, due in part to old crop sales in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2016, and the previously announced change in business with Philip Morris International, Inc. in the United States from a toll processing model to sales of processed tobacco, were offset by lower margins and lower earnings from Guatemala and Mexico. In addition, processing volumes declined significantly compared with fiscal year 2015 as a result of that change in business, and a portion of crop volumes sold under this new arrangement carried over as shipments in fiscal year 2017. Fiscal year 2016 revenues for the segment increased by 19% to $361.8 million compared to fiscal year 2015, on higher sales volumes at lower green leaf prices, a less favorable product mix, and lower processing revenues.\nOther Tobacco Operations\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the Other Tobacco Operations segment operating income increased by $1.0 million to $11.3 million compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Earnings were up significantly for the dark tobacco operations on higher volumes, better margins, and lower selling, general, and administrative costs. That improvement was partly offset by lower results from the oriental joint venture as benefits from improved margins and lower overhead costs were outweighed by higher currency remeasurement losses and tax accruals. The special services group incurred losses for fiscal year 2016, mainly from startup and production testing costs for the new food ingredients business. Revenues for the segment were down by $7.4 million to $219.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, as the higher volumes for the dark tobacco operations were more than offset by reduced volumes at lower prices from the timing of shipments of oriental tobaccos into the United States compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nOther Items\nCost of goods sold decreased by about 8% to $1.7 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to lower green leaf prices and the effects of local-currency devaluations on factory costs compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Selling, general, and administrative costs decreased by $23.5 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. The decline for fiscal year 2016 was mainly driven by reductions in local currency-denominated expenses from devaluation of foreign currencies in South America and Africa, and lower incentive compensation costs, reduced in part by higher net currency and exchange losses in Asia, as well as costs to settle challenges regarding property rights and valuation in South America.\nInterest expense of $15.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, declined by about 8% compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. The reduction was mostly due to lower average short-term borrowings for seasonal working capital, offset in part by higher effective interest rates on long-term bank loans from fixed interest rate swaps entered on those loans in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The consolidated effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, was approximately 32% compared to about 24% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Income taxes for fiscal year 2015 were reduced by a non-recurring benefit of $8.0 million arising from the partial payment of the European Commission fine by our Italian subsidiary in June 2014. In both fiscal year 2016 and 2015, the decrease from the 35% U.S. statutory rate was also influenced by lower net effective tax rates on income from certain foreign subsidiaries, as well as the effects of changes in local currency exchange rates on deferred income tax balances.\nResults for the year ended March 31, 2016, included restructuring and impairment costs of $2.4 million ($0.06 per diluted share) and a gain of $3.4 million ($0.08 per diluted share) on remeasuring our interest in a tobacco processing joint venture to fair value upon acquiring our partner's 50% ownership in the third fiscal quarter. Results for the year ended March 31, 2015, included an income tax benefit of $8.0 million ($0.28 per diluted share) arising from a subsidiary's payment of a portion of a fine, restructuring costs of $4.9 million ($0.11 per diluted share), and a gain of $12.7 million ($0.29 per diluted share), from updated projections related to the favorable outcome in fiscal year 2014 of litigation in Brazil regarding previous years' excise tax credits.\nAccounting Pronouncements\nSee \"Accounting Pronouncements\" in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") that will become effective and be adopted by the Company in future reporting periods.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nOur working capital requirements in fiscal year 2017 were lower than those in fiscal year 2016 due in part to reduced purchase volumes in Brazil. Our buying program in Brazil was reduced in fiscal year 2017 due to the smaller size of the Brazilian crop, largely from El Nino weather patterns, and unsustainable green leaf prices. Similar to last year, our shipments were heavily weighted to the second half of the fiscal year. In fiscal year 2017, we generated $250.3 million in cash flows from our operating activities, and our liquidity was sufficient to meet our needs, including the $178.4 million cash settlement of the mandatory conversion of the remainder of our Series B 6.75% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (\"Series B Preferred Stock\") in the fourth fiscal quarter. We also continued our conservative financial policies, maintained our discipline on using our free cash flow, and returned funds to shareholders.\nOur liquidity and capital resource requirements are predominately short-term in nature and primarily relate to working capital required for tobacco crop purchases. Working capital needs are seasonal within each geographic region. The geographic dispersion and the timing of working capital needs permit us to predict our general level of cash requirements, although crop sizes, prices paid to farmers, shipment and delivery timing, and currency fluctuations affect requirements each year. Peak working capital requirements are generally reached during the first and second fiscal quarters. Each geographic area follows a cycle of buying, processing, and shipping tobacco, and in many regions we also provide agricultural materials to farmers during the growing season. The timing of the elements of each cycle is influenced by such factors as local weather conditions and individual customer shipping requirements, which may change the level or the duration of crop financing. Despite a predominance of short-term needs, we maintain a portion of our total debt as long-term to reduce liquidity risk. We also periodically have large cash balances that we utilize to meet our working capital requirements.\nWe believe that our financial resources are adequate to support our capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Our seasonal borrowing requirements primarily relate to purchasing crops in South America and Africa and can increase from March to September by more than $300 million. The funding required can vary significantly depending upon such factors as crop sizes, the price of leaf, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, and the timing of shipments and customer payments. We deal with this uncertainty by maintaining substantial credit lines and cash balances. In addition to our operating requirements for working capital, we expect to spend around $35 to $45 million during fiscal year 2018 for capital expenditures to maintain our facilities and invest in opportunities to grow and improve our businesses. We also expect to provide about $8 million in funding to our pension plans. We have no long-term debt maturing before fiscal year 2020. After balancing our capital structure, any excess cash flow from operations after dividends and capital expenditures will be available to fund expansion, purchase our stock, or otherwise enhance shareholder value.\nCash Flow\nOur operations generated about $250.3 million in operating cash flows in fiscal year 2017. That amount was about $63.8 million higher than the $186.5 million we generated in fiscal year 2016, largely due to lower working capital requirements in fiscal year 2017 on the reduced purchase volumes in Brazil, as well as earlier shipment timing in North America and increased trade payables and accrued expenses in Brazil and Africa. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, we spent $35.6 million on capital projects, settled the mandatory conversion of our Series B Preferred Stock for $178.4 million in cash, and returned $60.9 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. At March 31, 2017, cash balances totaled $284.0 million.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital at March 31, 2017, was about $1.3 billion, down $98.9 million from last year's level of about $1.4 billion, largely due to reduced purchase volumes in Brazil, earlier shipment timing in North America, and increased trade payables and accrued expenses in Brazil and Africa in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. Tobacco inventories of $565.9 million at March 31, 2017, were down $71.2 million compared to inventory levels at the end of the prior fiscal year, largely on the lower purchase volumes and earlier shipments. We usually finance inventory with a mix of cash, notes payable, and customer deposits, depending on our borrowing capabilities, interest rates, and exchange rates, as well as those of our customers. We generally do not purchase material quantities of tobacco on a speculative basis. However, when we contract directly with farmers, we are often obligated to buy all stalk positions, which may contain less marketable leaf styles. Our uncommitted tobacco inventories decreased by approximately $4.6 million to $116.2 million, or about 21% of tobacco inventory, at March 31, 2017. Uncommitted inventories at March 31, 2016, were $120.8 million, which represented 19% of tobacco inventory. The level of these uncommitted inventories is influenced by timing of farmer deliveries of new crops, as well as the receipt of customer orders.\nShare Activity\nDuring December 2016, holders of 111,072 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock voluntarily exercised their conversion rights. These shares were converted into 2,487,118 shares of our common stock. In January 2017, we exercised our option to mandatorily convert all remaining outstanding shares of our Series B Preferred Stock and elected to settle our conversion obligation in cash. Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock received the product of the conversion rate, 22.4306, and the average volume weighted average price of Universal's common stock during the cash settlement averaging period for each share of Series B Preferred Stock converted. The cash settlement occurred on January 31, 2017, and totaled approximately $178.4 million on the 107,418 shares of Series B Preferred Stock converted. We used cash on hand for the settlement. All rights of the holders with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock terminated upon conversion. The Series B Preferred Stock dividends, totaling approximately $15 million per annum, are no longer paid.\nOur Board of Directors approved our current share repurchase program in November 2015. The program expires in November 2017, authorizes the purchase of up to $100 million of our common and preferred stock. Under the current authorization, we may purchase shares from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at prices not exceeding prevailing market rates. In determining our level of common share repurchase activity, our intent is to use only cash available after meeting our anticipated capital investment, dividend, and working capital requirements. Repurchases of shares under the repurchase program may vary based on management discretion, as well as changes in cash flow generation and availability. During fiscal year 2017, we did not purchase any shares of our common or preferred stock under this program. At March 31, 2017, our available authorization under our current share repurchase program was $100 million, and approximately 25.3 million common shares were outstanding.\nCapital Spending\nOur capital expenditures are generally limited to those that add value, replace or maintain equipment, increase efficiency, or position us for future growth. In deciding where to invest capital resources, we look for opportunities where we believe we can earn an adequate return, leverage our assets and expertise, and enhance our farmer base. During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, we invested $35.6 million and $47.2 million, respectively, in our property, plant, and equipment. Depreciation expense was approximately $35.9 million and $36.8 million, respectively, in fiscal years 2017 and 2016. Generally, our capital spending on maintenance projects is at a level below depreciation expense in order to maintain strong cash flow. In addition, from time to time, we undertake projects that require capital expenditures when we identify opportunities to improve efficiencies, add value for our customers, and position ourselves for future growth. We currently plan to spend approximately $35 to $45 million in fiscal year 2018 on capital projects for maintenance of our facilities and other investments to grow and improve our businesses.\nOutstanding Debt and Other Financing Arrangements\nWe consider the sum of notes payable and overdrafts, long-term debt (including any current portion), and customer advances and deposits, less cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments on our balance sheet to be our net debt. We also consider our net debt plus shareholders' equity to be our net capitalization. Net debt increased by $23.3 million to $154.9 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The increase primarily reflects lower cash balances due mainly to the cash settlement of our Series B Preferred Stock mandatory conversion in the fourth fiscal quarter. Net debt as a percentage of net capitalization was approximately 11% at March 31, 2017, up from 9% at March 31, 2016, and it remains lower than our target limit for peak borrowings of 30% to 40% of net capitalization.\nAs of March 31, 2017, we had $430 million available under a committed revolving credit facility that will mature in December 2019, and we, together with our consolidated affiliates, had approximately $307 million in uncommitted lines of credit, of which approximately $248 million were unused and available to support seasonal working capital needs. The financial covenants under our committed revolving credit facility require us to maintain certain levels of tangible net worth and observe restrictions on debt levels. As of March 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants of our debt agreements. We also have an active, undenominated universal shelf registration filed with the SEC in November 2014 that provides for future issuance of additional debt or equity securities. We have no long-term debt maturing in fiscal year 2018.\nDerivatives\nFrom time to time, we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. Currently, we have interest rate swap agreements that convert the variable benchmark LIBOR rate on our two outstanding term loans to fixed rates. With the swap agreements in place, the effective interest rates on our $150 million five-year term loan and $220 million seven-year term loan were 2.94% and 3.48%, respectively, as of March 31, 2017. These agreements were entered into to eliminate the variability of cash flows in the interest payments on our variable rate five- and seven-year term loans and are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Under the swap agreements, we receive variable rate interest and pay fixed rate interest. At March 31, 2017, the fair value of our open interest rate hedge swaps was a net asset of approximately $2 million.\nWe also enter forward contracts from time to time to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, primarily related to forecast purchases of tobacco and related processing costs in Brazil, as well as our net monetary asset exposure in local currency there. We generally account for our hedges of forecast tobacco purchases as cash flow hedges. At March 31, 2017, the fair value of those open contracts was an immaterial net asset. We also had other forward contracts outstanding that were not designated as hedges, and the\nfair value of those contracts was a net asset of approximately $0.8 million at March 31, 2017. For additional information, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nPension Funding\nFunds supporting our ERISA-regulated U.S. defined benefit pension plan increased by $10 million during fiscal year 2016 to $207 million, as contributions and asset returns exceeded benefit payments. The accumulated benefit obligation ( ABO\u201d) and the projected benefit obligation ( PBO\u201d) were both approximately $223 million as of March 31, 2017. The ABO and PBO are calculated on the basis of certain assumptions that are outlined in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. We expect to make contributions of about $8 million to our pension plans, including $6 million to our ERISA-regulated plan, during the next year. It is our policy to regularly monitor the performance of the funds and to review the adequacy of our funding and plan contributions.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of March 31, 2017, were as follows:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands of dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019-2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021-2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable and long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>479,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>233,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory purchase obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tobacco\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>690,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>622,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agricultural materials\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,268,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>755,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>256,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes interest payments. Interest payments on $429.1 million of variable rate debt were estimated based on rates as of March 31, 2017. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps that effectively convert the interest payments on the $370.0 million outstanding balance of its two bank term loans from variable to fixed. The fixed rate has been used to determine the contractual interest payments for all periods.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition to principal and interest payments on notes payable and long-term debt, our contractual obligations include operating lease payments, inventory purchase commitments, and capital expenditure commitments. Operating lease obligations represent minimum payments due under leases for various production, storage, distribution, and other facilities, as well as vehicles and equipment. Tobacco inventory purchase obligations primarily represent contracts to purchase tobacco from farmers. The amounts shown above are estimates since actual quantities purchased will depend on crop yield, and prices will depend on the quality of the tobacco delivered. About 43% of our crop year contracts to purchase tobacco are with farmers in Brazil. We have partially funded our tobacco purchases in Brazil and in other regions with advances to farmers and other suppliers, which totaled approximately $104 million, net of allowances, at March 31, 2017. In addition, we have guaranteed bank loans to farmers in Brazil that relate to a portion of our tobacco purchase obligations there. At March 31, 2017, we were contingently liable under those guarantees for outstanding balances of approximately $17 million (including accrued interest), and we had recorded a liability of approximately $1 million for the fair value of those guarantees. As tobacco is purchased and the related bank loans are repaid, our contingent liability is reduced.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nIn preparing the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect our supplemental information disclosures, including information about contingencies, risks, and financial condition. We believe, given current facts and circumstances, that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, adhere to GAAP, and are consistently applied. However, changes in the assumptions used could result in a material adjustment to the financial statements. Our critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas:\nInventories\nInventories of tobacco are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the specific cost method. Raw materials are clearly identified at the time of purchase. We track the costs associated with raw materials in the final product lots, and maintain this identification through the time of sale. We also capitalize direct and indirect costs related to processing raw materials. This method of cost accounting is referred to as the specific cost or specific identification method. We write down inventory for changes in market value based upon assumptions related to future demand and market conditions if the indicated market value is below cost. Future demand assumptions can be impacted by changes in customer sales, changes in customers' inventory positions and policies, competitors' pricing policies and inventory positions, and varying crop sizes and qualities. Market conditions that differ significantly from those assumed by management could result in additional write-downs. We experience inventory write-downs routinely. Inventory write-downs in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $10.9 million, $11.9 million, and $18.6 million, respectively. The Company incurred a higher level of inventory write-downs in fiscal year 2015 primarily due to the effects of oversupply conditions in the global leaf tobacco markets.\nAdvances to Suppliers and Guarantees of Bank Loans to Suppliers\nIn many sourcing origins, we provide tobacco growers with agronomy services and seasonal crop advances of, or for, seed, fertilizer, and other supplies. These advances are short term in nature and are customarily repaid upon delivery of tobacco to us. In several origins, we have also made long-term advances to tobacco farmers to finance curing barns and other farm infrastructure. In Brazil, we also guarantee bank loans made to farmers for seasonal crop financing. In some years, due to low crop yields and other factors, individual farmers may not deliver sufficient volumes of tobacco to repay maturing advances. In those cases, we may extend repayment of the advances into the following crop year or satisfy the guarantee by acquiring the loan from the bank. In either situation, we will incur losses whenever we are unable to recover the full amount of the loans and advances. At each reporting period, we must make estimates and assumptions in determining the valuation allowance for advances to farmers and the liability to accrue for our obligations under bank loan guarantees. At March 31, 2017, the gross balance of advances to suppliers totaled approximately $134 million, and the related valuation allowance totaled approximately $27 million. The fair value of the loan guarantees for farmers in Brazil was a liability of approximately $1 million at March 31, 2017.\nRecoverable Value-Added Tax Credits\nIn many foreign countries, we pay significant amounts of value-added tax ( VAT\u201d) on purchases of unprocessed and processed tobacco, crop inputs, packing materials, and various other goods and services. In some countries, VAT is a national tax, and in other countries it is assessed at the state level. Items subject to VAT vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, as do the rates at which the tax is assessed. When we sell tobacco to customers in the country of origin, we generally collect VAT on those sales. We are normally permitted to offset our VAT payments against those collections and remit only the incremental VAT collections to the tax authorities. When tobacco is sold for export, VAT is normally not assessed. In countries where our tobacco sales are predominately for export markets, we often do not generate enough VAT collections on downstream sales to fully offset our VAT payments. In those situations, we can accumulate unused VAT credits. Some jurisdictions have procedures that allow companies to apply for refunds of unused VAT credits from the tax authorities, but the refund process often takes an extended period of time and it is not uncommon for refund applications to be challenged or rejected in part on technical grounds. Other jurisdictions may permit companies to sell or transfer unused VAT credits to third parties in private transactions, although approval for such transactions must normally be obtained from the tax authorities, limits on the amounts that can be transferred may be imposed, and the proceeds realized may be heavily discounted from the face value of the credits. Due to these factors, in some countries we can accumulate significant balances of VAT credits over time. We review these balances on a regular basis, and we record valuation allowances on the credits to reflect amounts that we do not expect to recover, as well as discounts anticipated on credits we expect to sell or transfer. In determining the appropriate valuation allowance to record in a given jurisdiction, we must make various estimates and assumptions about factors affecting the ultimate recovery of the VAT credits. At March 31, 2017, the gross balance of recoverable tax credits (primarily VAT) totaled approximately $45 million, and the related valuation allowance totaled approximately $13 million.\nGoodwill\nWe review the carrying value of goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis and at any time that events or business conditions indicate that it may be impaired. As permitted under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 350 ( ASC 350\u201d), at March 31, 2017 and 2016, we elected to base our initial assessment of potential impairment on qualitative factors. Those factors did not indicate any impairment of our recorded goodwill. In fiscal years prior to basing our initial assessment on qualitative factors, we followed the quantitative approach in ASC 350 in assessing the fair value of our goodwill, which involved the use of discounted cash flow models (Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy under GAAP). Under our current qualitative assessment, we would also use those discounted cash flow models to measure any expected impairment indicated by the assessment. The calculations in these models are not based on observable market data from independent sources and therefore require significant management judgment with respect to operating earnings growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Significant adverse changes in our operations or our estimates of future cash flows for a reporting unit with recorded goodwill, such as those caused by unforeseen events or changes in market conditions, could result in an impairment charge. Over 90% of our goodwill balance relates to our reporting unit in Brazil.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe hold various financial assets and financial liabilities that are required to be measured and reported at fair value in our financial statements, including money market funds, trading securities associated with deferred compensation plans, interest rate swaps, forward foreign currency exchange contracts, and guarantees of bank loans to tobacco growers. We follow the relevant accounting guidance in determining the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities. Money market funds are valued based on net asset value ( NAV\u201d), which is used as a practical expedient to measure the fair value of those funds (not classified within the fair value hierarchy). Quoted market prices (Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy) are used in most cases to determine the fair values of trading securities. Interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency exchange contracts are valued based on dealer quotes using discounted cash flow models matched to the contractual terms of each instrument (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). The fair value of the guarantees of bank loans to tobacco growers, which was approximately $1 million at March 31, 2017, is derived using an internally-developed discounted cash flow model. The model requires various inputs, including historical loss percentages for comparable loans and a risk-adjusted interest rate. Because significant management judgment is required in determining and applying these inputs to the valuation model, our process for determining the fair value of these guarantees is classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2017, a 1% increase in the expected loss percentage for all guaranteed farmer loans would not have had a material effect on the fair value of the guarantee obligation. In addition, a 1% change in the risk-adjusted interest rate would not have had a material effect on the fair value of the guarantee obligation. We incorporate credit risk in determining the fair values of our financial assets and financial liabilities, but that risk did not materially affect the fair values of any of those assets or liabilities at March 31, 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nOur consolidated effective income tax rate is based on our expected taxable income, tax laws and statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and evaluating our tax position. We are subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions, and could be subject to a tax audit in each of these jurisdictions, which could result in adjustments to tax expense in future periods. In the event that there is a significant, unusual, or one-time item recognized in our results, the tax attributed to that discrete item would be recorded at the same time as the item.\nWe have no undistributed earnings of consolidated foreign subsidiaries that are classified as permanently or indefinitely reinvested. We assume that all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be repatriated back to their parent entities in the United States where the funds are best placed to meet our cash flow requirements. In addition, we strive to mitigate economic, political, and currency risk by following a disciplined annual approach to the distribution of excess capital back to the U.S. Based on these assumptions, in our income tax expense for each reporting period we fully provide for all additional U.S. income taxes that are expected to be due on these distributions.\nOur accounting for uncertain tax positions requires that we review all significant tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in income tax returns for all jurisdictions in which we operate. In this review, we must assume that all tax positions will ultimately be audited, and either accepted or rejected based on the applicable tax regulations by the tax authorities for those jurisdictions. We must recognize in our financial statements only the tax benefits associated with tax positions that are more likely than not\u201d to be accepted upon audit, at the greatest amount that is considered more likely than not\u201d to be accepted. These determinations require significant management judgment, and changes in any given quarterly or annual reporting period could affect our consolidated income tax rate.\nTax regulations require items to be included in taxable income in the tax return at different times, and in some cases in different amounts, than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, our effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not tax deductible, while others are related to timing issues, such as differences in depreciation methods. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for\nwhich payment has been deferred or income taxes related to expenses that have not yet been recognized in the financial statements, but have been deducted in our tax return. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our financial statements. We record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when the amount of estimated future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Determining the amount of such valuation allowances requires significant management judgment, including estimates of future taxable income in multiple tax jurisdictions where we operate. Based on our periodic earnings forecasts, we project the upcoming year's taxable income to help us evaluate our ability to realize deferred tax assets.\nThe functional currency in most of our significant foreign operations is the U.S. dollar, as export tobacco sales are generally made in dollars. Purchasing and processing costs are usually incurred in local currency. When the U.S. dollar is weakening relative to the local currency, purchasing and processing costs increase in dollar terms, resulting in higher cost inventory. The sale of that inventory in dollars generates less taxable income in local currency, which results in lower income taxes owed when translated into U.S. dollars. This causes the effective income tax rate on dollar income to be lower than the statutory rate in the local country. The reverse can occur when the local currency is weakening relative to the U.S. dollar, thereby causing the effective income tax rate on dollar earnings to be above the statutory rate. This impact on our effective income tax rate in a country can be significant during a normal crop cycle. A prolonged period of strengthening or weakening over more than one crop may increase the impact if we sell material quantities of old crop inventories. Lower-taxed foreign source income increases our ability to use foreign tax credits. Higher-taxed foreign source income has the reverse effect. When these changes occur in our larger operations, such as our operations in Brazil, they can have a material impact on our overall tax position.\nFor additional disclosures on income taxes, see Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nThe measurement of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and costs at the end of each fiscal year requires that we make various assumptions that are used by our actuaries in estimating the present value of projected future benefit payments to all plan participants. Those assumptions take into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. The assumptions we use may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions to our plans. The plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets. The significant assumptions used in the calculation of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are:\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Discount rate - The discount rate is based on investment yields on a hypothetical portfolio of actual long-term corporate bonds rated AA that align with the cash flows for our benefit obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Salary scale - The salary scale assumption is based on our long-term actual experience for salary increases, the near-term outlook, and expected inflation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expected long-term return on plan assets - The expected long-term return on plan assets reflects asset allocations and investment strategy adopted by the Pension Investment Committee of the Board of Directors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Retirement and mortality rates - Retirement rates are based on actual plan experience along with our near-term outlook. Early retirement assumptions are based on our actual experience. Mortality rates are based on standard industry group annuity mortality tables which are updated to reflect projected improvements in life expectancy.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Healthcare cost trend rates - For postretirement medical plan obligations and costs, we make assumptions on future inflationary increases in medical costs. These assumptions are based on our actual experience, along with third-party forecasts of long-term medical cost trends.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> From one fiscal year to the next, the rates we use for each of the above assumptions may change based on market developments and other factors. The discount rate reflects prevailing market interest rates at the end of the fiscal year when the benefit obligations are actuarially measured and will increase or decrease based on market patterns. The expected long-term return on plan assets may change based on changes in investment strategy for plan assets or changes in indicated longer-term yields on specific classes of plan assets. Based on the high percentage of retired and inactive participants in our ERISA-regulated domestic defined benefit pension plan (approximately 75% of total participants), as well as the high funded status of the plan, the Pension Investment Committee adopted changes to the underlying plan assets to move toward a liability-driven investment strategy. We reduced our expected long-term return on assets assumption for the actuarial valuations in both fiscal years 2015 and 2016, primarily to reflect those changes. We also adopted revised mortality tables in fiscal year 2015 based on updated actuarial studies reflecting improvements in life expectancy. In addition to the changes in actuarial assumptions from year to year, actual plan experience affecting our net benefit obligations, such as actual returns on plan assets and actual mortality experience, will differ from the assumptions used to measure the obligations. The effects of these changes and differences increase or decrease the obligation we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and they also create gains and losses that are accumulated and amortized over future periods, thus affecting the expense we recognize for these plans over those periods. Changes in the discount rate from year to year generally have the largest impact on our projected benefit obligation and annual expense, and the effects may be significant, particularly over successive years where the discount rate moves in the same direction.\nAs of March 31, 2017, the effect of the indicated increase or decrease in the selected pension and other postretirement benefit valuation assumptions is shown below. The effect assumes no change in benefit levels.\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands of dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect on\n2017 Projected\nBenefit Obligation\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect on\n2018 Annual Expense\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in Assumptions for Pension Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount Rate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26,653\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,597\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected Long-Term Return on Plan Assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,264\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in Assumptions for Other Postretirement Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount Rate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,055\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(347\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare Cost Trend Rate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(688\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA 1% increase or decrease in the salary scale assumption would not have a material effect on the projected benefit obligation or on annual expense for the Company's pension benefits. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\nOther Estimates and Assumptions\nOther management estimates and assumptions are routinely required in preparing our financial statements, including the determination of valuation allowances on accounts receivable and the fair value of long-lived assets. Changes in market and economic conditions, local tax laws, and other related factors are considered each reporting period, and adjustments to the accounts are made based on management's best judgment.\nOTHER INFORMATION REGARDING TRENDS\nAND MANAGEMENT'S ACTIONS\nOur financial performance depends on our ability to obtain an appropriate price for our products and services, to secure the tobacco volumes and quality desired by our customers, and to maintain efficient, competitive operations. We continually monitor issues and opportunities that may impact the supply of and demand for leaf tobacco, the volumes of leaf tobacco that we handle, and the services we provide.\nSupply\nGlobal flue-cured and burley tobacco production decreased in our fiscal year 2017, largely due to smaller crops in Brazil following adverse weather conditions there. This was the second fiscal year of declines in crop sizes following oversupplied tobacco markets in fiscal year 2015. Crop sizes for flue-cured tobaccos available for export are expected to increase modestly in fiscal year 2018, primarily on the recovery of the Brazilian tobacco crops due to better weather conditions, while burley crops sizes are expected to decrease. Though we believe that flue-cured tobacco is in a slight oversupply position and burley tobacco production levels are largely in balance with anticipated demand, imbalances in certain leaf styles or types may remain through fiscal year 2018.\nProduction\nWorldwide flue-cured tobacco production outside of China decreased by about 13% in fiscal year 2017 to 1.8 billion kilos, including an approximately 19% reduction in Brazil following El Nino weather patterns there. Worldwide burley crops decreased by about 9% in fiscal year 2017. We estimate that at March 31, 2017, industry uncommitted flue-cured and burley inventories, excluding China, totaled about 83 million kilos, a decrease of about 28% from March 31, 2016 levels.\nIn the near term, flue-cured tobacco production is expected to increase driven by the recovery of the Brazilian crop, partially offset by smaller crops in many other flue-cured tobacco growing origins. We expect that flue-cured production (excluding China) will increase by about 9%, to about 1.9 billion kilos, in fiscal year 2018, including about a 35% increase in the size of the Brazilian flue-cured crop. Worldwide burley production is forecast to decrease by about 8%. We also forecast that oriental tobacco and dark air-cured production will decline by 5% and 15%, respectively, in fiscal year 2018. Over the long term, we believe that global tobacco production will continue a slight decline in line with slightly declining total demand. South America, Asia, Africa, and North America will remain key sourcing regions for flue-cured and burley tobaccos.\nChina\nChina is a significant cigarette market. However, most of the cigarettes consumed in China and the leaf tobacco used in those cigarettes are produced domestically. Therefore, we normally view the Chinese market independently when evaluating worldwide leaf tobacco supply and demand. Recently, the Chinese domestic cigarette consumption level has decreased. We believe that China's domestic leaf production now exceeds their domestic needs for the local cigarette market, and we have seen a build-up of domestic leaf inventory there. China is currently demonstrating efforts to re-align their domestic leaf production and inventories to balance their needs, and these efforts could influence global supply/demand in the short term.\nPricing\nFactors that affect green tobacco prices include global supply and demand, market conditions, production costs, foreign exchange rates, and competition from other crops. We work with farmers to maintain tobacco production and to secure product at price levels that are attractive to both the farmers and our customers. Our objective is to secure compliant tobacco that is produced in a cost-effective manner under a sustainable business model with the desired quality for our customers. In some areas, tobacco competes with agricultural commodity products for farmer production. If prices for soybeans, wheat, rice, and seed oils rise in certain origins, green tobacco prices may have to rise to maintain tobacco production levels. In the past, leaf shortages in specific markets or on a worldwide basis have also led to green tobacco price increases.\nDemand\nIndustry data shows that over the past ten years, total world consumption of cigarettes fell at the compound annual rate of 0.8%. We believe that growth in world consumption of cigarettes peaked several years ago and is declining. As a result, we expect that near term global demand for leaf tobacco will continue to slowly decline in line with declining cigarette consumption.\nOur sales consist primarily of flue-cured and burley tobaccos. Those types of tobacco, along with oriental tobaccos, are used in American-blend cigarettes which are primarily smoked in Western Europe and the United States. English-blend cigarettes which use flue-cured tobacco are mainly smoked in the United Kingdom and Asia and other emerging markets. Industry data shows that consumption of American-blend cigarettes has declined at a compound annual rate of 2.6% for the ten years ended in 2016. As cigarette consumption declines in developed markets and increases in the emerging markets, there may be less demand for burley and oriental tobaccos and more demand for flue-cured tobacco. However, demand is affected by many factors, including regulation, product taxation, illicit trade, alternative tobacco products, and Chinese imports. To the extent that domestic leaf production and inventory durations in China do not meet requirements for Chinese cigarette blends, that tobacco could be sourced from other origins where we have major market positions. On a year-to-year basis, we are also susceptible to fluctuations in leaf supply due to crop sizes and leaf demand as manufacturers adjust inventories or respond to changes in cigarette markets. With higher projected crop year 2017 leaf tobacco production, we currently expect supply for flue-cured tobacco to be in a slight oversupply position and burley tobacco to be largely in line with anticipated demand. However, inventories held by our customers may affect their near-term demand for leaf tobacco. We also sell oriental tobacco, which is used in American-blend cigarettes, and dark tobacco, which is used in cigars and other smokeless products. While we expect demand for oriental tobacco and dark tobacco used in cigar filler to be generally in line with supply, we are seeing an undersupply of dark tobacco used for cigar wrappers.\nRegulation and Product Taxation\nDecreased social acceptance of smoking and increased pressure from anti-smoking groups have had an ongoing adverse effect on the percentage of the population using tobacco products, particularly in the United States and Western Europe. Also, many foreign governments have taken or proposed steps to restrict or prohibit cigarette advertising and promotion, to increase taxes on cigarettes, to prohibit smoking in public areas, and to discourage cigarette consumption. A number of such measures are included in the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control ( FCTC\u201d), which was negotiated under the auspices of the WHO and offers guidelines for discouraging or controlling tobacco use. Countries that are parties to the FCTC may choose the level of implementation of the guidelines that is most suitable with their approach to tobacco control. For example, recently China imposed a ban on smoking in public places, and in the United Kingdom and Australia, laws have been passed mandating plain packaging, the removal of branding on cigarette packages. We cannot predict the extent to which government efforts to reduce tobacco consumption might affect the business of our primary customers. However, a significant decrease in worldwide tobacco consumption, as well as shifts to modified risk tobacco products brought about by existing or future governmental laws and regulations, could reduce demand for leaf tobacco and services and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, certain recommendations by the WHO, through the FCTC, may cause shifts in customer usage of certain types and styles of tobacco. As seen in Canada, Brazil, and the European Union, efforts have been taken to eliminate flavorings from tobacco products. Such decisions could cause a change in requirements for certain tobaccos in particular countries. Shifts in customer demand from one type of tobacco to another could create sourcing issues as requirements move from one origin to another. Furthermore, instruction at the farm level may be required to produce the changing styles of tobacco needed by tobacco product manufacturers. Given our established and well-developed programs at the farm level worldwide, we are particularly well positioned to meet manufacturer requirements.\nIn 2009, the U.S. Congress passed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act ( the Act\u201d). This legislation authorizes the FDA to regulate the manufacturing and marketing of all tobacco products. The FDA has banned flavored cigarettes, restricted youth access to tobacco products, banned advertising claims regarding certain tobacco products, established new smokeless tobacco warnings, and issued new cigarette health warnings. In addition, the FDA established the Center for Tobacco Products ( CTP\u201d). The CTP has focused on establishing the scientific foundation and regulatory framework for regulating tobacco products in the United States. On May 10, 2016, the FDA released deeming\u201d regulations that extend FDA oversight to all tobacco products including electronic nicotine delivery systems, cigars, hookah tobacco, pipe tobacco, dissolvables, and novel and future products.\u201d The regulations require that tobacco product manufacturers register tobacco products that existed on February 15, 2007, and to seek FDA authorization to sell any products modified or introduced after such date. All such submissions require manufacturers to list ingredients in their products. Regulations impacting our customer base that change the requirements for leaf tobacco or restrict their ability to sell their products will inherently impact our business. As discussed, we have established programs that begin at the farm level to assist our customers with raw material information to support leaf traceability and customer testing requirements. Additionally, given our global presence, we also have the ability to source different types and styles of tobacco for our customers should their needs change due to regulation.\nA number of governments, particularly federal and local governments in the United States and the European Union, impose excise or similar taxes on tobacco products. There has been, and will likely continue to be, new legislation proposing new or increased taxes on tobacco products. In some cases, proposed legislation seeks to significantly increase existing taxes on tobacco products, or impose new taxes on products that to date have not been subject to tax. Increases in product taxation may reduce the affordability of cigarettes and influence the level of illicit trade, which will affect the global leaf markets.\nIllicit Trade\nIllicit trade is another factor which influences demand for leaf tobacco. Industry estimates of the illegal, unregulated black market for cigarettes are approximately 10% to 12% of global stick consumption, representing $40 to $50 billion in lost tax revenue globally. We support industry efforts to eradicate illicit trade.\nAlternative Tobacco Products\nMany of the major tobacco product manufacturers have been developing next generation and modified risk products. These include electronic nicotine delivery systems, liquid vaporizers, and non-combustible products. Electronic nicotine delivery systems and liquid vaporizers use liquid nicotine, which is predominately derived from leaf tobacco, and non-combustible products use leaf tobacco. At this time it is unclear how these new products will affect demand for leaf tobacco. However, as our customers develop these products, we continue to work with them to make sure we are well-positioned to meet their needs for both their traditional and new products. Currently, regulation of these products as well as consumer acceptance and their influence on smoking trends are unclear, and we continue to monitor industry developments. Electronic nicotine delivery systems, non-combustible products, and other next generation products are now primarily consumed in Western Europe, Japan, and the United States, and it is unclear what effect the consumption of these new products may have on global demand for leaf tobacco in the future.\nCurrent Industry Dynamics\nLeaf tobacco is sourced directly by product manufacturers, by global leaf suppliers such as ourselves, and by other smaller, mostly regional or local, leaf suppliers. We estimate that, of the flue-cured and burley tobacco grown outside of China, approximately one-third is purchased directly by major manufacturers, slightly over one-third is handled by the global leaf suppliers, and the remainder is sourced by the smaller regional or local suppliers. Although we operate in a mature industry, where demand for the end products is declining at a slow rate, we continually look for ways to grow our business. In recent years, we believe that we have been able to maintain relatively steady tobacco volumes handled, despite declines in demand for leaf tobacco from product manufacturers, by increasing our market share. We also believe that there are several longer term trends in the industry that could provide additional opportunities for us to maintain or increase our market share and to offer additional services to our customers.\nManufacturers naturally seek to mitigate raw materials cost increases, and they are placing increased emphasis on cost containment as they address declining demand. While this is not a new trend, it continues to offer opportunities to us as we bring supply chain efficiencies to the leaf markets. We believe that global leaf suppliers add efficiencies to the markets through economies of scale, as well as through the vital role played in finding buyers for all styles and qualities of leaf tobacco, which achieves overall cost reductions. To understand our business, it is important to note that tobacco is not a commodity product. Flavor and smoking characteristics of tobacco vary based on the type of tobacco and the region where the tobacco is grown. In addition, characteristics of tobacco leaves vary by their position on the stalk of the plant, which means that many different styles and grades of tobacco may be produced in a single tobacco crop. A particular manufacturer, in seeking tobacco for its proprietary blend, may only want and have use for certain leaves of a plant. The leaf tobacco supplier plays a vital role in the industry by finding buyers for all of the leaf grades and styles of tobacco produced in a farmer's crop. This role helps to eliminate excess tobacco being produced, which improves leaf utilization.\nIn addition to leaf utilization, we bring operational efficiencies to the industry, which in turn help reduce costs. These efficiencies include economical utilization of processing capacity in our facilities, an established and scalable global network of agronomists and technicians helping maintain a stable, productive, and sustainable farmer base, and agronomic and production improvements to optimize leaf yields and qualities. In addition, we are able to offer manufacturers a complete range of services from the field to the delivery of the packed product that benefit from our efficiencies. These services include such things as buying station optimization, processing to specific customer specifications or needs, storage of green or packed leaf tobacco, and logistical services. In recent years, we have seen an increase in the level of direct purchasing and other supply chain services that we provide our customers, notably in the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Poland, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic. We believe these moves acknowledge the efficiencies and services that global leaf suppliers bring to the entire supply chain.\nWe have also seen some reductions in sourcing from lower-volume tobacco growing regions by both global leaf suppliers and major manufacturers. Flue-cured tobacco is produced in over 70 countries around the world, and burley tobacco is grown in over 45 countries. However, over 80% of the flue-cured tobacco grown outside of China and over 85% of the worldwide burley tobacco production is sourced from the top ten growing areas for each type of tobacco. We believe that these moves to reduce sourcing areas are another way for the industry to increase efficiency and to reduce costs. We maintain a strong presence in all of the major tobacco sourcing areas and believe that any growth in these areas would favor global leaf suppliers such as ourselves. In\nthe future, we expect that increased regulations requiring stringent monitoring and testing of leaf chemistry and compliant sourcing documentation could place greater emphasis on major sourcing areas.\nAs we have said for a number of years, the production of compliant leaf for the tobacco industry continues to grow in importance. To be considered compliant, leaf tobacco must be grown utilizing Good Agricultural Practices. We have long invested significant resources in the programs and infrastructure needed to work with growers to produce compliant leaf and continue to enhance our ability to monitor and demonstrate this compliance for customers. Our Good Agricultural Practices support an approach to farming that is focused on sustainability, employing sound field production and labor management practices that meet our customers' needs, promote farmer profitability and reflect environmental sensitivity. To assist them, Universal provides comprehensive training, technical support in the field, and crop analytics through ongoing research and development. We believe that compliant leaf will continue to be important to our customers and should favor global suppliers who are able to deliver this product.\nWe also believe that a key factor in our ability to perform successfully in this industry is our ability to provide customers with the quality of leaf and the level of service they desire on a global basis at competitive prices, while maintaining a stability of supply. As the leading global leaf tobacco supplier, we add significant value to the supply chain, providing expertise in dealing with large numbers of farmers, efficiently selling various qualities of leaf produced in each crop to a broad global customer base, and delivering products that meet stringent quality and regulatory specifications. We also help stabilize the tobacco markets and influence crop development at the farm level. Our key objective is to continually adapt our business model to meet our customers' evolving needs while continuing to provide stability of supply and the quality that distinguishes our products and services. In addition, we monitor new product developments in the industry to identify areas where we can provide additional value to our customers.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition and results of operations of a leading global leaf tobacco supplier.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to enhance the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, Part I, Item 1, Business\u201d and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d For information on risks and uncertainties related to our business that may make past performance not indicative of future results, or cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, see General,\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nOVERVIEW\nWe are the leading global leaf tobacco supplier. We derive most of our revenues from sales of processed tobacco to manufacturers of tobacco products throughout the world and from fees and commissions for specific services. We hold a strategic position in the world leaf markets where we work closely with both our customers and farmers to ensure that we deliver a compliant product that meets our customers' needs while promoting a strong supplier base. We adapt to meet changes in customer requirements as well as broader changes in the leaf markets, while continuing to provide the stability of supply and high level of service that distinguishes us in the marketplace. We believe that we have successfully met the needs of both our customers and suppliers while adapting to changes in leaf markets. Over the last three fiscal years, we have generated over $660 million in net cash flow from operations, invested over $145 million in our businesses, settled the mandatory conversion of our Series B 6.75% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (\"Series B Preferred Stock\") for about $178 million in cash, and returned over $210 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.\nWe have also faced challenging market conditions over the last three fiscal years. In fiscal year 2015, declines in some of our customers' sales volumes in the U.S. and Western European markets, partially due to weak economic conditions, reduced demand for leaf tobacco. At the same time, crops sold in fiscal year 2015 were larger than those sold in fiscal year 2014. Given fiscal year 2015's oversupplied market conditions, we were pleased with the results we achieved. We ended the year with strong fourth quarter results, which helped to bring our segment operating earnings for the fiscal year in line with our expectations. We also realized higher margins and maintained our solid financial position. We believe that our performance that year demonstrated our ability to execute well on our objective of delivering a compliant product in an efficient manner to our customers, under challenging circumstances.\nWe achieved improved results in fiscal year 2016, after managing through a second year of oversupplied market conditions. As anticipated, we ended the year with strong fourth quarter volumes, primarily driven by later timing of customer shipping orders in Brazil and Asia, and the positive change in leaf supply arrangements in our North America segment. We also achieved modest growth in overall volumes for the full fiscal year and improved our margins, and our selling, general, and administrative costs were lower. Our inventories continued to be well-managed, and uncommitted stocks declined from fiscal year 2015's level, in line with our target.\nWe delivered solid results again in fiscal year 2017 despite supply headwinds, most notably from the weather-reduced crop sizes in Brazil and ongoing challenging market conditions in Tanzania. Although we had anticipated ending the year with slightly lower volumes, earlier shipment timing as well as attractive green prices in some origins resulting in some additional purchases by our customers boosted shipments later in our fiscal year, allowing us to improve our market share and achieve lamina sales volumes that were slightly above those of the prior fiscal year.\nOur segment operating income for the 2017 fiscal year was also improved, primarily attributable to a reduction in selling, general, and administrative costs and earlier receipt of distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries. We believe that our success reflects our continuing efforts to bring efficiencies to the leaf tobacco supply chain. Through the hard work of our dedicated employees around the world, we have been able to expand services that we provide our customers and, despite continuing slow decline in demand for consumer tobacco products, maintain our volumes handled.\nWe also maintained our strong balance sheet in fiscal year 2017, and our lower working capital requirements from smaller crops and prudent buying programs helped us to retain the necessary cash reserves to support our working capital needs in fiscal year 2018. In addition, in fiscal year 2017, we continued our focus on providing returns to our shareholders through completion of the conversion of our preferred stock, increasing the common dividend rate, and returning more than $60 million in dividends.\nAs we move into fiscal year 2018, we are forecasting that global flue-cured tobacco production outside of China will increase by about 9%, largely from the recovery of the Brazilian crop due to better weather conditions there, and that burley tobacco production will decrease by approximately 8%, primarily due to reductions in Africa. Although it is too early to determine whether the additional purchases by customers in fiscal year 2017 may impact their requirements in fiscal year 2018, we continue to strive to be our customers' supplier of choice, providing them compliant products and quality services at a competitive price.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAmounts described as net income and earnings per diluted share in the following discussion are attributable to Universal Corporation and exclude earnings related to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries. The total for segment operating income referred to in the discussion below is a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We have provided a reconciliation of the total for segment operating income to consolidated operating income in Note 14. \"Operating Segments\" to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. We evaluate our segment performance excluding certain significant charges or credits. We believe this measure, which excludes these items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, provides investors with important information that is useful in understanding our business results and trends.\nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2017, Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2016\nNet income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, was $106.3 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, compared with fiscal year 2016's net income of $109.0 million, or $3.92 per diluted share. The fiscal year 2017 results included a one-time reduction of earnings available to common shareholders of $74.4 million, or $2.99 per diluted share, for purposes of determining the amounts reported for basic and diluted earnings per share, from the conversion for cash of the remaining outstanding shares of our Series B 6.75% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock under the mandatory conversion in January 2017. That one-time reduction and certain other non-recurring items are detailed in Other Items below. Excluding those items, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year of $3.97 increased $0.07 compared to the same period last year. Operating income of $178.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, was down $3.3 million compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. Segment operating income, which excludes non-recurring items, was $188.5 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $2.4 million from the prior year, primarily attributable to improved results for the North America segment, partly offset by a decline for the Other Tobacco Operations segment. Revenues of $2.1 billion for fiscal year 2017 were relatively flat compared with the previous year, as the slightly higher volumes and a benefit from earlier receipt of distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries were offset by lower green leaf costs and lower processing revenues.\nFlue-cured and Burley Leaf Tobacco Operations\nOther Regions\nOperating income for the Other Regions segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, of $143.3 million, was nearly flat, down only $0.3 million compared to $143.6 million in the previous fiscal year. Total volumes for the segment declined, but overall margins improved, benefitting from lower selling, general, and administrative expenses and timing of receipt of distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries. Africa volumes were slightly lower, reflecting challenging market conditions in Tanzania which offset volume improvements in other origins. South America's results were down, continuing the trend noted throughout the fiscal year from lower volumes and higher factory unit costs as a result of the reduced buying program and lower third-party processing volumes there this year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the segment were down significantly for the fiscal year on several items, including the favorable comparison to costs incurred in fiscal year 2016 to settle challenges regarding property rights and valuation of forestry land in South America, the reversal of value-added tax reserves, lower net foreign currency and exchange remeasurement losses, and a reduction in provisions for supplier advances compared to the previous fiscal year. Revenues for the segment were down about $116.0 million to $1.4 billion, on the lower sales volumes at lower average green leaf prices and lower processing revenues, offset in part by increased distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries.\nNorth America\nOperating income for the North America segment was $35.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, up $4.0 million compared with the previous year. Earnings improvements were driven mainly by higher sales volumes, partially due to earlier timing of current crop shipments in fiscal 2017. However, margins for the year were lower from a less favorable product mix, as well as reduced factory yields on weather affected U.S. crops. Fiscal year 2017 revenues for the segment increased by $54.6 million to $416.4 million compared to the previous fiscal year, on those higher sales volumes, at lower green leaf prices, and a less favorable product mix.\nOther Tobacco Operations\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, the Other Tobacco Operations segment operating income decreased by $1.3 million to $10.0 million compared with the same period last year. Earnings improved modestly for the dark tobacco operations as higher domestic volumes were largely offset by a less favorable sales mix and higher inventory write-downs this year. Results from the oriental joint venture also improved for the period mainly on favorable comparisons due to tax accruals in the prior year. Those improvements were outweighed by higher losses in the special services group, primarily for the new food ingredients business. Higher selling, general, and administrative costs for the segment also contributed to the declines. Revenues for the segment were up by $12.2 million to $231.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2017, mostly due to increased volumes from the timing of shipments of oriental tobaccos into the United States compared to the previous year.\nOther Items\nCost of goods sold decreased by about 2% to $1.7 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The decline was consistent with a comparable percentage decline in revenues, mostly as a result of lower green leaf prices. Selling, general, and administrative costs decreased by $14.7 million, or 6%, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, compared with the prior fiscal year. The decline in fiscal year 2017 was mainly due to the favorable comparison to costs incurred in fiscal year 2016 to settle challenges regarding property rights and valuation of forestry land in South America, the reversal of value-added tax reserves, and lower net foreign currency and exchange remeasurement losses compared to the previous fiscal year.\nThe consolidated effective income tax rates were approximately 34% and 32% for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Income taxes in both fiscal years were lower than the 35% federal statutory rate on a combination of lower net effective tax rates on income from certain foreign subsidiaries, and effects of changes in local currency exchange rates on deferred income tax balances, mainly in Brazil.\nIn December 2016, 111,072 shares of the Series B 6.75% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock were converted into approximately 2.5 million shares of our common stock. In January 2017, we announced a mandatory conversion of all 107,418 remaining outstanding shares of the preferred stock after meeting the requirements to initiate the mandatory conversion under the original terms of the preferred shares. We chose to satisfy the conversion obligation for the mandatory conversion in cash. Although the conversions of the preferred stock into common stock or for cash did not impact net income, the shares converted for cash under the mandatory conversion in January 2017 resulted in a one-time reduction of retained earnings of approximately $74.4 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2017, representing the excess of the conversion cost over the carrying value of those shares. The reduction in retained earnings resulted in a corresponding one-time reduction of earnings available to common shareholders for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 for purposes of determining the amounts reported for basic and diluted earnings per share. The effect of the mandatory conversion on diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, was ($2.99).\nResults for the year ended March 31, 2017, also included restructuring and impairment costs of $4.4 million ($0.10 per diluted share). Results for the year ended March 31, 2016, included restructuring and impairment costs of $2.4 million ($0.06 per diluted share) and a gain of $3.4 million ($0.08 per diluted share) on remeasuring our interest in a tobacco processing joint venture to fair value upon acquiring our partner's 50% ownership in the third fiscal quarter.\nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2016, Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2015\nNet income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, was $109.0 million, or $3.92 per diluted share, compared with net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, of $114.6 million, or $4.06 per diluted share. Those results included certain non-recurring items, detailed in Other Items below, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.02 and $0.46 for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding those items in both years, net income for fiscal year 2016 increased $6.8 million ($0.30 per diluted share) compared to the same period in fiscal year 2015. Segment operating income, which excludes those items, was $186.1 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $18.8 million, or 11%, from fiscal year 2015. That improvement was primarily attributable to a reduction in selling, general, and administrative costs, as well as improved gross margins on fiscal year 2016's modestly higher sales volumes. Revenues of $2.1 billion for fiscal year 2016 declined 7% compared with fiscal year 2015, driven mainly by lower green leaf costs and lower processing revenues, partly mitigated by the increase in volumes.\nFlue-cured and Burley Leaf Tobacco Operations\nOther Regions\nOperating income for the Other Regions segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, was $143.6 million, up 14% compared to $125.8 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Better margins, fewer inventory write-downs, and lower selling, general, and administrative expenses drove the earnings improvement. These positive factors outweighed lower margins in Europe and the currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. dollar which negatively impacted results from that region. Strong volumes in most regions were offset by declines in Africa on smaller crop sizes in some origins compared to fiscal year 2015. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the segment were down significantly for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, largely on reductions in local currency-denominated expenses from devaluation of foreign currencies, mainly in South America and Africa, and lower incentive compensation costs. Revenues for the segment were down about 12% to $1.5 billion, driven mostly by lower average green leaf prices and the modestly reduced volumes.\nNorth America\nOperating income for the North America segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, of $31.1 million was flat compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Earnings improvements from sales volume increases, due in part to old crop sales in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2016, and the previously announced change in business with Philip Morris International, Inc. in the United States from a toll processing model to sales of processed tobacco, were offset by lower margins and lower earnings from Guatemala and Mexico. In addition, processing volumes declined significantly compared with fiscal year 2015 as a result of that change in business, and a portion of crop volumes sold under this new arrangement carried over as shipments in fiscal year 2017. Fiscal year 2016 revenues for the segment increased by 19% to $361.8 million compared to fiscal year 2015, on higher sales volumes at lower green leaf prices, a less favorable product mix, and lower processing revenues.\nOther Tobacco Operations\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the Other Tobacco Operations segment operating income increased by $1.0 million to $11.3 million compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Earnings were up significantly for the dark tobacco operations on higher volumes, better margins, and lower selling, general, and administrative costs. That improvement was partly offset by lower results from the oriental joint venture as benefits from improved margins and lower overhead costs were outweighed by higher currency remeasurement losses and tax accruals. The special services group incurred losses for fiscal year 2016, mainly from startup and production testing costs for the new food ingredients business. Revenues for the segment were down by $7.4 million to $219.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, as the higher volumes for the dark tobacco operations were more than offset by reduced volumes at lower prices from the timing of shipments of oriental tobaccos into the United States compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nOther Items\nCost of goods sold decreased by about 8% to $1.7 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to lower green leaf prices and the effects of local-currency devaluations on factory costs compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Selling, general, and administrative costs decreased by $23.5 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. The decline for fiscal year 2016 was mainly driven by reductions in local currency-denominated expenses from devaluation of foreign currencies in South America and Africa, and lower incentive compensation costs, reduced in part by higher net currency and exchange losses in Asia, as well as costs to settle challenges regarding property rights and valuation in South America.\nInterest expense of $15.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, declined by about 8% compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. The reduction was mostly due to lower average short-term borrowings for seasonal working capital, offset in part by higher effective interest rates on long-term bank loans from fixed interest rate swaps entered on those loans in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The consolidated effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, was approximately 32% compared to about 24% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Income taxes for fiscal year 2015 were reduced by a non-recurring benefit of $8.0 million arising from the partial payment of the European Commission fine by our Italian subsidiary in June 2014. In both fiscal year 2016 and 2015, the decrease from the 35% U.S. statutory rate was also influenced by lower net effective tax rates on income from certain foreign subsidiaries, as well as the effects of changes in local currency exchange rates on deferred income tax balances.\nResults for the year ended March 31, 2016, included restructuring and impairment costs of $2.4 million ($0.06 per diluted share) and a gain of $3.4 million ($0.08 per diluted share) on remeasuring our interest in a tobacco processing joint venture to fair value upon acquiring our partner's 50% ownership in the third fiscal quarter. Results for the year ended March 31, 2015, included an income tax benefit of $8.0 million ($0.28 per diluted share) arising from a subsidiary's payment of a portion of a fine, restructuring costs of $4.9 million ($0.11 per diluted share), and a gain of $12.7 million ($0.29 per diluted share), from updated projections related to the favorable outcome in fiscal year 2014 of litigation in Brazil regarding previous years' excise tax credits.\nAccounting Pronouncements\nSee \"Accounting Pronouncements\" in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") that will become effective and be adopted by the Company in future reporting periods.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nOur working capital requirements in fiscal year 2017 were lower than those in fiscal year 2016 due in part to reduced purchase volumes in Brazil. Our buying program in Brazil was reduced in fiscal year 2017 due to the smaller size of the Brazilian crop, largely from El Nino weather patterns, and unsustainable green leaf prices. Similar to last year, our shipments were heavily weighted to the second half of the fiscal year. In fiscal year 2017, we generated $250.3 million in cash flows from our operating activities, and our liquidity was sufficient to meet our needs, including the $178.4 million cash settlement of the mandatory conversion of the remainder of our Series B 6.75% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (\"Series B Preferred Stock\") in the fourth fiscal quarter. We also continued our conservative financial policies, maintained our discipline on using our free cash flow, and returned funds to shareholders.\nOur liquidity and capital resource requirements are predominately short-term in nature and primarily relate to working capital required for tobacco crop purchases. Working capital needs are seasonal within each geographic region. The geographic dispersion and the timing of working capital needs permit us to predict our general level of cash requirements, although crop sizes, prices paid to farmers, shipment and delivery timing, and currency fluctuations affect requirements each year. Peak working capital requirements are generally reached during the first and second fiscal quarters. Each geographic area follows a cycle of buying, processing, and shipping tobacco, and in many regions we also provide agricultural materials to farmers during the growing season. The timing of the elements of each cycle is influenced by such factors as local weather conditions and individual customer shipping requirements, which may change the level or the duration of crop financing. Despite a predominance of short-term needs, we maintain a portion of our total debt as long-term to reduce liquidity risk. We also periodically have large cash balances that we utilize to meet our working capital requirements.\nWe believe that our financial resources are adequate to support our capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Our seasonal borrowing requirements primarily relate to purchasing crops in South America and Africa and can increase from March to September by more than $300 million. The funding required can vary significantly depending upon such factors as crop sizes, the price of leaf, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, and the timing of shipments and customer payments. We deal with this uncertainty by maintaining substantial credit lines and cash balances. In addition to our operating requirements for working capital, we expect to spend around $35 to $45 million during fiscal year 2018 for capital expenditures to maintain our facilities and invest in opportunities to grow and improve our businesses. We also expect to provide about $8 million in funding to our pension plans. We have no long-term debt maturing before fiscal year 2020. After balancing our capital structure, any excess cash flow from operations after dividends and capital expenditures will be available to fund expansion, purchase our stock, or otherwise enhance shareholder value.\nCash Flow\nOur operations generated about $250.3 million in operating cash flows in fiscal year 2017. That amount was about $63.8 million higher than the $186.5 million we generated in fiscal year 2016, largely due to lower working capital requirements in fiscal year 2017 on the reduced purchase volumes in Brazil, as well as earlier shipment timing in North America and increased trade payables and accrued expenses in Brazil and Africa. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, we spent $35.6 million on capital projects, settled the mandatory conversion of our Series B Preferred Stock for $178.4 million in cash, and returned $60.9 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. At March 31, 2017, cash balances totaled $284.0 million.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital at March 31, 2017, was about $1.3 billion, down $98.9 million from last year's level of about $1.4 billion, largely due to reduced purchase volumes in Brazil, earlier shipment timing in North America, and increased trade payables and accrued expenses in Brazil and Africa in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. Tobacco inventories of $565.9 million at March 31, 2017, were down $71.2 million compared to inventory levels at the end of the prior fiscal year, largely on the lower purchase volumes and earlier shipments. We usually finance inventory with a mix of cash, notes payable, and customer deposits, depending on our borrowing capabilities, interest rates, and exchange rates, as well as those of our customers. We generally do not purchase material quantities of tobacco on a speculative basis. However, when we contract directly with farmers, we are often obligated to buy all stalk positions, which may contain less marketable leaf styles. Our uncommitted tobacco inventories decreased by approximately $4.6 million to $116.2 million, or about 21% of tobacco inventory, at March 31, 2017. Uncommitted inventories at March 31, 2016, were $120.8 million, which represented 19% of tobacco inventory. The level of these uncommitted inventories is influenced by timing of farmer deliveries of new crops, as well as the receipt of customer orders.\nShare Activity\nDuring December 2016, holders of 111,072 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock voluntarily exercised their conversion rights. These shares were converted into 2,487,118 shares of our common stock. In January 2017, we exercised our option to mandatorily convert all remaining outstanding shares of our Series B Preferred Stock and elected to settle our conversion obligation in cash. Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock received the product of the conversion rate, 22.4306, and the average volume weighted average price of Universal's common stock during the cash settlement averaging period for each share of Series B Preferred Stock converted. The cash settlement occurred on January 31, 2017, and totaled approximately $178.4 million on the 107,418 shares of Series B Preferred Stock converted. We used cash on hand for the settlement. All rights of the holders with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock terminated upon conversion. The Series B Preferred Stock dividends, totaling approximately $15 million per annum, are no longer paid.\nOur Board of Directors approved our current share repurchase program in November 2015. The program expires in November 2017, authorizes the purchase of up to $100 million of our common and preferred stock. Under the current authorization, we may purchase shares from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at prices not exceeding prevailing market rates. In determining our level of common share repurchase activity, our intent is to use only cash available after meeting our anticipated capital investment, dividend, and working capital requirements. Repurchases of shares under the repurchase program may vary based on management discretion, as well as changes in cash flow generation and availability. During fiscal year 2017, we did not purchase any shares of our common or preferred stock under this program. At March 31, 2017, our available authorization under our current share repurchase program was $100 million, and approximately 25.3 million common shares were outstanding.\nCapital Spending\nOur capital expenditures are generally limited to those that add value, replace or maintain equipment, increase efficiency, or position us for future growth. In deciding where to invest capital resources, we look for opportunities where we believe we can earn an adequate return, leverage our assets and expertise, and enhance our farmer base. During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, we invested $35.6 million and $47.2 million, respectively, in our property, plant, and equipment. Depreciation expense was approximately $35.9 million and $36.8 million, respectively, in fiscal years 2017 and 2016. Generally, our capital spending on maintenance projects is at a level below depreciation expense in order to maintain strong cash flow. In addition, from time to time, we undertake projects that require capital expenditures when we identify opportunities to improve efficiencies, add value for our customers, and position ourselves for future growth. We currently plan to spend approximately $35 to $45 million in fiscal year 2018 on capital projects for maintenance of our facilities and other investments to grow and improve our businesses.\nOutstanding Debt and Other Financing Arrangements\nWe consider the sum of notes payable and overdrafts, long-term debt (including any current portion), and customer advances and deposits, less cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments on our balance sheet to be our net debt. We also consider our net debt plus shareholders' equity to be our net capitalization. Net debt increased by $23.3 million to $154.9 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The increase primarily reflects lower cash balances due mainly to the cash settlement of our Series B Preferred Stock mandatory conversion in the fourth fiscal quarter. Net debt as a percentage of net capitalization was approximately 11% at March 31, 2017, up from 9% at March 31, 2016, and it remains lower than our target limit for peak borrowings of 30% to 40% of net capitalization.\nAs of March 31, 2017, we had $430 million available under a committed revolving credit facility that will mature in December 2019, and we, together with our consolidated affiliates, had approximately $307 million in uncommitted lines of credit, of which approximately $248 million were unused and available to support seasonal working capital needs. The financial covenants under our committed revolving credit facility require us to maintain certain levels of tangible net worth and observe restrictions on debt levels. As of March 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants of our debt agreements. We also have an active, undenominated universal shelf registration", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to enhance the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, Part I, Item 1, Business\u201d and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d For information on risks and uncertainties related to our business that may make past performance not indicative of future results, or cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, see General,\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nOVERVIEW\nWe are the leading global leaf tobacco supplier. We derive most of our revenues from sales of processed tobacco to manufacturers of tobacco products throughout the world and from fees and commissions for specific services. We hold a strategic position in the world leaf markets where we work closely with both our customers and farmers to ensure that we deliver a compliant product that meets our customers' needs while promoting a strong supplier base. We adapt to meet changes in customer requirements as well as broader changes in the leaf markets, while continuing to provide the stability of supply and high level of service that distinguishes us in the marketplace. We believe that we have successfully met the needs of both our customers and suppliers while adapting to changes in leaf markets. Over the last three fiscal years, we have generated over $660 million in net cash flow from operations, invested over $145 million in our businesses, settled the mandatory conversion of our Series B 6.75% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (\"Series B Preferred Stock\") for about $178 million in cash, and returned over $210 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.\nWe have also faced challenging market conditions over the last three fiscal years. In fiscal year 2015, declines in some of our customers' sales volumes in the U.S. and Western European markets, partially due to weak economic conditions, reduced demand for leaf tobacco. At the same time, crops sold in fiscal year 2015 were larger than those sold in fiscal year 2014. Given fiscal year 2015's oversupplied market conditions, we were pleased with the results we achieved. We ended the year with strong fourth quarter results, which helped to bring our segment operating earnings for the fiscal year in line with our expectations. We also realized higher margins and maintained our solid financial position. We believe that our performance that year demonstrated our ability to execute well on our objective of delivering a compliant product in an efficient manner to our customers, under challenging circumstances.\nWe achieved improved results in fiscal year 2016, after managing through a second year of oversupplied market conditions. As anticipated, we ended the year with strong fourth quarter volumes, primarily driven by later timing of customer shipping orders in Brazil and Asia, and the positive change in leaf supply arrangements in our North America segment. We also achieved modest growth in overall volumes for the full fiscal year and improved our margins, and our selling, general, and administrative costs were lower. Our inventories continued to be well-managed, and uncommitted stocks declined from fiscal year 2015's level, in line with our target.\nWe delivered solid results again in fiscal year 2017 despite supply headwinds, most notably from the weather-reduced crop sizes in Brazil and ongoing challenging market conditions in Tanzania. Although we had anticipated ending the year with slightly lower volumes, earlier shipment timing as well as attractive green prices in some origins resulting in some additional purchases by our customers boosted shipments later in our fiscal year, allowing us to improve our market share and achieve lamina sales volumes that were slightly above those of the prior fiscal year.\nOur segment operating income for the 2017 fiscal year was also improved, primarily attributable to a reduction in selling, general, and administrative costs and earlier receipt of distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries. We believe that our success reflects our continuing efforts to bring efficiencies to the leaf tobacco supply chain. Through the hard work of our dedicated employees around the world, we have been able to expand services that we provide our customers and, despite continuing slow decline in demand for consumer tobacco products, maintain our volumes handled.\nWe also maintained our strong balance sheet in fiscal year 2017, and our lower working capital requirements from smaller crops and prudent buying programs helped us to retain the necessary cash reserves to support our working capital needs in fiscal year 2018. In addition, in fiscal year 2017, we continued our focus on providing returns to our shareholders through completion of the conversion of our preferred stock, increasing the common dividend rate, and returning more than $60 million in dividends.\nAs we move into fiscal year 2018, we are forecasting that global flue-cured tobacco production outside of China will increase by about 9%, largely from the recovery of the Brazilian crop due to better weather conditions there, and that burley tobacco production will decrease by approximately 8%, primarily due to reductions in Africa. Although it is too early to determine whether the additional purchases by customers in fiscal year 2017 may impact their requirements in fiscal year 2018, we continue to strive to be our customers' supplier of choice, providing them compliant products and quality services at a competitive price.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAmounts described as net income and earnings per diluted share in the following discussion are attributable to Universal Corporation and exclude earnings related to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries. The total for segment operating income referred to in the discussion below is a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We have provided a reconciliation of the total for segment operating income to consolidated operating income in Note 14. \"Operating Segments\" to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. We evaluate our segment performance excluding certain significant charges or credits. We believe this measure, which excludes these items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, provides investors with important information that is useful in understanding our business results and trends.\nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2017, Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2016\nNet income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, was $106.3 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, compared with fiscal year 2016's net income of $109.0 million, or $3.92 per diluted share. The fiscal year 2017 results included a one-time reduction of earnings available to common shareholders of $74.4 million, or $2.99 per diluted share, for purposes of determining the amounts reported for basic and diluted earnings per share, from the conversion for cash of the remaining outstanding shares of our Series B 6.75% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock under the mandatory conversion in January 2017. That one-time reduction and certain other non-recurring items are detailed in Other Items below. Excluding those items, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year of $3.97 increased $0.07 compared to the same period last year. Operating income of $178.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, was down $3.3 million compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. Segment operating income, which excludes non-recurring items, was $188.5 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $2.4 million from the prior year, primarily attributable to improved results for the North America segment, partly offset by a decline for the Other Tobacco Operations segment. Revenues of $2.1 billion for fiscal year 2017 were relatively flat compared with the previous year, as the slightly higher volumes and a benefit from earlier receipt of distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries were offset by lower green leaf costs and lower processing revenues.\nFlue-cured and Burley Leaf Tobacco Operations\nOther Regions\nOperating income for the Other Regions segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, of $143.3 million, was nearly flat, down only $0.3 million compared to $143.6 million in the previous fiscal year. Total volumes for the segment declined, but overall margins improved, benefitting from lower selling, general, and administrative expenses and timing of receipt of distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries. Africa volumes were slightly lower, reflecting challenging market conditions in Tanzania which offset volume improvements in other origins. South America's results were down, continuing the trend noted throughout the fiscal year from lower volumes and higher factory unit costs as a result of the reduced buying program and lower third-party processing volumes there this year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the segment were down significantly for the fiscal year on several items, including the favorable comparison to costs incurred in fiscal year 2016 to settle challenges regarding property rights and valuation of forestry land in South America, the reversal of value-added tax reserves, lower net foreign currency and exchange remeasurement losses, and a reduction in provisions for supplier advances compared to the previous fiscal year. Revenues for the segment were down about $116.0 million to $1.4 billion, on the lower sales volumes at lower average green leaf prices and lower processing revenues, offset in part by increased distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries.\nNorth America\nOperating income for the North America segment was $35.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, up $4.0 million compared with the previous year. Earnings improvements were driven mainly by higher sales volumes, partially due to earlier timing of current crop shipments in fiscal 2017. However, margins for the year were lower from a less favorable product mix, as well as reduced factory yields on weather affected U.S. crops. Fiscal year 2017 revenues for the segment increased by $54.6 million to $416.4 million compared to the previous fiscal year, on those higher sales volumes, at lower green leaf prices, and a less favorable product mix.\nOther Tobacco Operations\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, the Other Tobacco Operations segment operating income decreased by $1.3 million to $10.0 million compared with the same period last year. Earnings improved modestly for the dark tobacco operations as higher domestic volumes were largely offset by a less favorable sales mix and higher inventory write-downs this year. Results from the oriental joint venture also improved for the period mainly on favorable comparisons due to tax accruals in the prior year. Those improvements were outweighed by higher losses in the special services group, primarily for the new food ingredients business. Higher selling, general, and administrative costs for the segment also contributed to the declines. Revenues for the segment were up by $12.2 million to $231.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2017, mostly due to increased volumes from the timing of shipments of oriental tobaccos into the United States compared to the previous year.\nOther Items\nCost of goods sold decreased by about 2% to $1.7 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The decline was consistent with a comparable percentage decline in revenues, mostly as a result of lower green leaf prices. Selling, general, and administrative costs decreased by $14.7 million, or 6%, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, compared with the prior fiscal year. The decline in fiscal year 2017 was mainly due to the favorable comparison to costs incurred in fiscal year 2016 to settle challenges regarding property rights and valuation of forestry land in South America, the reversal of value-added tax reserves, and lower net foreign currency and exchange remeasurement losses compared to the previous fiscal year.\nThe consolidated effective income tax rates were approximately 34% and 32% for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Income taxes in both fiscal years were lower than the 35% federal statutory rate on a combination of lower net effective tax rates on income from certain foreign subsidiaries, and effects of changes in local currency exchange rates on deferred income tax balances, mainly in Brazil.\nIn December 2016, 111,072 shares of the Series B 6.75% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock were converted into approximately 2.5 million shares of our common stock. In January 2017, we announced a mandatory conversion of all 107,418 remaining outstanding shares of the preferred stock after meeting the requirements to initiate the mandatory conversion under the original terms of the preferred shares. We chose to satisfy the conversion obligation for the mandatory conversion in cash. Although the conversions of the preferred stock into common stock or for cash did not impact net income, the shares converted for cash under the mandatory conversion in January 2017 resulted in a one-time reduction of retained earnings of approximately $74.4 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2017, representing the excess of the conversion cost over the carrying value of those shares. The reduction in retained earnings resulted in a corresponding one-time reduction of earnings available to common shareholders for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 for purposes of determining the amounts reported for basic and diluted earnings per share. The effect of the mandatory conversion on diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, was ($2.99).\nResults for the year ended March 31, 2017, also included restructuring and impairment costs of $4.4 million ($0.10 per diluted share). Results for the year ended March 31, 2016, included restructuring and impairment costs of $2.4 million ($0.06 per diluted share) and a gain of $3.4 million ($0.08 per diluted share) on remeasuring our interest in a tobacco processing joint venture to fair value upon acquiring our partner's 50% ownership in the third fiscal quarter.\nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2016, Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2015\nNet income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, was $109.0 million, or $3.92 per diluted share, compared with net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, of $114.6 million, or $4.06 per diluted share. Those results included certain non-recurring items, detailed in Other Items below, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.02 and $0.46 for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding those items in both years, net income for fiscal year 2016 increased $6.8 million ($0.30 per diluted share) compared to the same period in fiscal year 2015. Segment operating income, which excludes those items, was $186.1 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $18.8 million, or 11%, from fiscal year 2015. That improvement was primarily attributable to a reduction in selling, general, and administrative costs, as well as improved gross margins on fiscal year 2016's modestly higher sales volumes. Revenues of $2.1 billion for fiscal year 2016 declined 7% compared with fiscal year 2015, driven mainly by lower green leaf costs and lower processing revenues, partly mitigated by the increase in volumes.\nFlue-cured and Burley Leaf Tobacco Operations\nOther Regions\nOperating income for the Other Regions segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, was $143.6 million, up 14% compared to $125.8 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Better margins, fewer inventory write-downs, and lower selling, general, and administrative expenses drove the earnings improvement. These positive factors outweighed lower margins in Europe and the currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. dollar which negatively impacted results from that region. Strong volumes in most regions were offset by declines in Africa on smaller crop sizes in some origins compared to fiscal year 2015. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the segment were down significantly for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, largely on reductions in local currency-denominated expenses from devaluation of foreign currencies, mainly in South America and Africa, and lower incentive compensation costs. Revenues for the segment were down about 12% to $1.5 billion, driven mostly by lower average green leaf prices and the modestly reduced volumes.\nNorth America\nOperating income for the North America segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, of $31.1 million was flat compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Earnings improvements from sales volume increases, due in part to old crop sales in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2016, and the previously announced change in business with Philip Morris International, Inc. in the United States from a toll processing model to sales of processed tobacco, were offset by lower margins and lower earnings from Guatemala and Mexico. In addition, processing volumes declined significantly compared with fiscal year 2015 as a result of that change in business, and a portion of crop volumes sold under this new arrangement carried over as shipments in fiscal year 2017. Fiscal year 2016 revenues for the segment increased by 19% to $361.8 million compared to fiscal year 2015, on higher sales volumes at lower green leaf prices, a less favorable product mix, and lower processing revenues.\nOther Tobacco Operations\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the Other Tobacco Operations segment operating income increased by $1.0 million to $11.3 million compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Earnings were up significantly for the dark tobacco operations on higher volumes, better margins, and lower selling, general, and administrative costs. That improvement was partly offset by lower results from the oriental joint venture as benefits from improved margins and lower overhead costs were outweighed by higher currency remeasurement losses and tax accruals. The special services group incurred losses for fiscal year 2016, mainly from startup and production testing costs for the new food ingredients business. Revenues for the segment were down by $7.4 million to $219.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, as the higher volumes for the dark tobacco operations were more than offset by reduced volumes at lower prices from the timing of shipments of oriental tobaccos into the United States compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nOther Items\nCost of goods sold decreased by about 8% to $1.7 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to lower green leaf prices and the effects of local-currency devaluations on factory costs compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Selling, general, and administrative costs decreased by $23.5 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. The decline for fiscal year 2016 was mainly driven by reductions in local currency-denominated expenses from devaluation of foreign currencies in South America and Africa, and lower incentive compensation costs, reduced in part by higher net currency and exchange losses in Asia, as well as costs to settle challenges regarding property rights and valuation in South America.\nInterest expense of $15.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, declined by about 8% compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. The reduction was mostly due to lower average short-term borrowings for seasonal working capital, offset in part by higher effective interest rates on long-term bank loans from fixed interest rate swaps entered on those loans in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The consolidated effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, was approximately 32% compared to about 24% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Income taxes for fiscal year 2015 were reduced by a non-recurring benefit of $8.0 million arising from the partial payment of the European Commission fine by our Italian subsidiary in June 2014. In both fiscal year 2016 and 2015, the decrease from the 35% U.S. statutory rate was also influenced by lower net effective tax rates on income from certain foreign subsidiaries, as well as the effects of changes in local currency exchange rates on deferred income tax balances.\nResults for the year ended March 31, 2016, included restructuring and impairment costs of $2.4 million ($0.06 per diluted share) and a gain of $3.4 million ($0.08 per diluted share) on remeasuring our interest in a tobacco processing joint venture to fair value upon acquiring our partner's 50% ownership in the third fiscal quarter. Results for the year ended March 31, 2015, included an income tax benefit of $8.0 million ($0.28 per diluted share) arising from a subsidiary's payment of a portion of a fine, restructuring costs of $4.9 million ($0.11 per diluted share), and a gain of $12.7 million ($0.29 per diluted share), from updated projections related to the favorable outcome in fiscal year 2014 of litigation in Brazil regarding previous years' excise tax credits.\nAccounting Pronouncements\nSee \"Accounting Pronouncements\" in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") that will become effective and be adopted by the Company in future reporting periods.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nOur working capital requirements in fiscal year 2017 were lower than those in fiscal year 2016 due in part to reduced purchase volumes in Brazil. Our buying program in Brazil was reduced in fiscal year 2017 due to the smaller size of the Brazilian crop, largely from El Nino weather patterns, and unsustainable green leaf prices. Similar to last year, our shipments were heavily weighted to the second half of the fiscal year. In fiscal year 2017, we generated $250.3 million in cash flows from our operating activities, and our liquidity was sufficient to meet our needs, including the $178.4 million cash settlement of the mandatory conversion of the remainder of our Series B 6.75% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (\"Series B Preferred Stock\") in the fourth fiscal quarter. We also continued our conservative financial policies, maintained our discipline on using our free cash flow, and returned funds to shareholders.\nOur liquidity and capital resource requirements are predominately short-term in nature and primarily relate to working capital required for tobacco crop purchases. Working capital needs are seasonal within each geographic region. The geographic dispersion and the timing of working capital needs permit us to predict our general level of cash requirements, although crop sizes, prices paid to farmers, shipment and delivery timing, and currency fluctuations affect requirements each year. Peak working capital requirements are generally reached during the first and second fiscal quarters. Each geographic area follows a cycle of buying, processing, and shipping tobacco, and in many regions we also provide agricultural materials to farmers during the growing season. The timing of the elements of each cycle is influenced by such factors as local weather conditions and individual customer shipping requirements, which may change the level or the duration of crop financing. Despite a predominance of short-term needs, we maintain a portion of our total debt as long-term to reduce liquidity risk. We also periodically have large cash balances that we utilize to meet our working capital requirements.\nWe believe that our financial resources are adequate to support our capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Our seasonal borrowing requirements primarily relate to purchasing crops in South America and Africa and can increase from March to September by more than $300 million. The funding required can vary significantly depending upon such factors as crop sizes, the price of leaf, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, and the timing of shipments and customer payments. We deal with this uncertainty by maintaining substantial credit lines and cash balances. In addition to our operating requirements for working capital, we expect to spend around $35 to $45 million during fiscal year 2018 for capital expenditures to maintain our facilities and invest in opportunities to grow and improve our businesses. We also expect to provide about $8 million in funding to our pension plans. We have no long-term debt maturing before fiscal year 2020. After balancing our capital structure, any excess cash flow from operations after dividends and capital expenditures will be available to fund expansion, purchase our stock, or otherwise enhance shareholder value.\nCash Flow\nOur operations generated about $250.3 million in operating cash flows in fiscal year 2017. That amount was about $63.8 million higher than the $186.5 million we generated in fiscal year 2016, largely due to lower working capital requirements in fiscal year 2017 on the reduced purchase volumes in Brazil, as well as earlier shipment timing in North America and increased trade payables and accrued expenses in Brazil and Africa. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, we spent $35.6 million on capital projects, settled the mandatory conversion of our Series B Preferred Stock for $178.4 million in cash, and returned $60.9 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. At March 31, 2017, cash balances totaled $284.0 million.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital at March 31, 2017, was about $1.3 billion, down $98.9 million from last year's level of about $1.4 billion, largely due to reduced purchase volumes in Brazil, earlier shipment timing in North America, and increased trade payables and accrued expenses in Brazil and Africa in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. Tobacco inventories of $565.9 million at March 31, 2017, were down $71.2 million compared to inventory levels at the end of the prior fiscal year, largely on the lower purchase volumes and earlier shipments. We usually finance inventory with a mix of cash, notes payable, and customer deposits, depending on our borrowing capabilities, interest rates, and exchange rates, as well as those of our customers. We generally do not purchase material quantities of tobacco on a speculative basis. However, when we contract directly with farmers, we are often obligated to buy all stalk positions, which may contain less marketable leaf styles. Our uncommitted tobacco inventories decreased by approximately $4.6 million to $116.2 million, or about 21% of tobacco inventory, at March 31, 2017. Uncommitted inventories at March 31, 2016, were $120.8 million, which represented 19% of tobacco inventory. The level of these uncommitted inventories is influenced by timing of farmer deliveries of new crops, as well as the receipt of customer orders.\nShare Activity\nDuring December 2016, holders of 111,072 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock voluntarily exercised their conversion rights. These shares were converted into 2,487,118 shares of our common stock. In January 2017, we exercised our option to mandatorily convert all remaining outstanding shares of our Series B Preferred Stock and elected to settle our conversion obligation in cash. Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock received the product of the conversion rate, 22.4306, and the average volume weighted average price of Universal's common stock during the cash settlement averaging period for each share of Series B Preferred Stock converted. The cash settlement occurred on January 31, 2017, and totaled approximately $178.4 million on the 107,418 shares of Series B Preferred Stock converted. We used cash on hand for the settlement. All rights of the holders with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock terminated upon conversion. The Series B Preferred Stock dividends, totaling approximately $15 million per annum, are no longer paid.\nOur Board of Directors approved our current share repurchase program in November 2015. The program expires in November 2017, authorizes the purchase of up to $100 million of our common and preferred stock. Under the current authorization, we may purchase shares from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at prices not exceeding prevailing market rates. In determining our level of common share repurchase activity, our intent is to use only cash available after meeting our anticipated capital investment, dividend, and working capital requirements. Repurchases of shares under the repurchase program may vary based on management discretion, as well as changes in cash flow generation and availability. During fiscal year 2017, we did not purchase any shares of our common or preferred stock under this program. At March 31, 2017, our available authorization under our current share repurchase program was $100 million, and approximately 25.3 million common shares were outstanding.\nCapital Spending\nOur capital expenditures are generally limited to those that add value, replace or maintain equipment, increase efficiency, or position us for future growth. In deciding where to invest capital resources, we look for opportunities where we believe we can earn an adequate return, leverage our assets and expertise, and enhance our farmer base. During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, we invested $35.6 million and $47.2 million, respectively, in our property, plant, and equipment. Depreciation expense was approximately $35.9 million and $36.8 million, respectively, in fiscal years 2017 and 2016. Generally, our capital spending on maintenance projects is at a level below depreciation expense in order to maintain strong cash flow. In addition, from time to time, we undertake projects that require capital expenditures when we identify opportunities to improve efficiencies, add value for our customers, and position ourselves for future growth. We currently plan to spend approximately $35 to $45 million in fiscal year 2018 on capital projects for maintenance of our facilities and other investments to grow and improve our businesses.\nOutstanding Debt and Other Financing Arrangements\nWe consider the sum of notes payable and overdrafts, long-term debt (including any current portion), and customer advances and deposits, less cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments on our balance sheet to be our net debt. We also consider our net debt plus shareholders' equity to be our net capitalization. Net debt increased by $23.3 million to $154.9 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The increase primarily reflects lower cash balances due mainly to the cash settlement of our Series B Preferred Stock mandatory conversion in the fourth fiscal quarter. Net debt as a percentage of net capitalization was approximately 11% at March 31, 2017, up from 9% at March 31, 2016, and it remains lower than our target limit for peak borrowings of 30% to 40% of net capitalization.\nAs of March 31, 2017, we had $430 million available under a committed revolving credit facility that will mature in December 2019, and we, together with our consolidated affiliates, had approximately $307 million in uncommitted lines of credit, of which approximately $248 million were unused and available to support seasonal working capital needs. The financial covenants under our committed revolving credit facility require us to maintain certain levels of tangible net worth and observe restrictions on debt levels. As of March 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants of our debt agreements. We also have an active, undenominated universal shelf registration"}
