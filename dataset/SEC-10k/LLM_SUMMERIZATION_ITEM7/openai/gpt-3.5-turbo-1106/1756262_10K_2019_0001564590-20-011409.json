Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Item 1.A. Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage medical technology company transforming organ transplant therapy for end-stage organ failure patients across multiple disease states. We developed the OCS to replace a decades-old standard of care that we believe is significantly limiting access to life-saving transplant therapy for hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide. Our innovative OCS technology replicates many aspects of the organ's natural living and functioning environment outside of the human body. As such, the OCS represents a paradigm shift that transforms organ preservation for transplantation from a static state to a dynamic environment that enables new capabilities, including organ optimization and assessment. We believe our substantial body of clinical evidence has demonstrated the potential for the OCS to significantly increase the number of organ transplants and improve post-transplant outcomes.\nWe developed the OCS to comprehensively address the major limitations of cold storage. The OCS is a portable organ perfusion, optimization and monitoring system that utilizes our proprietary and customized technology to replicate near-physiologic conditions for donor organs outside of the human body. We designed the OCS technology platform to perfuse donor organs with warm, oxygenated, nutrient-enriched blood, while maintaining the organs in a living, functioning state; the lung is breathing, the heart is beating and the liver is producing bile. Because the OCS significantly reduces injurious ischemic time on donor organs as compared to cold storage and enables the optimization and assessment of donor organs, it has demonstrated improved clinical outcomes relative to cold storage and offers the potential to significantly improve donor organ utilization.\nWe designed the OCS to be a platform that allows us to leverage core technologies across products for multiple organs. To date, we have developed three OCS products, one for each of lung, heart and liver transplantations, making the OCS the only multi-organ technology platform. Our OCS products have been used for over 1,500 human organ transplants. During our clinical trials, we established relationships with over 55 leading transplant programs worldwide. We have commercialized the OCS Lung and OCS Heart outside of the United States and received our first PMA approval from the FDA in March 2018 for the use in the United States of the OCS Lung for donor lungs currently utilized for transplantation and since May 2019, for donor lungs currently unutilized for transplantation. We expect FDA action over the next six months on additional applications for PMAs we have submitted in connection with our other OCS products.\nSince our inception, we have focused substantially all of our resources on designing, developing and building our proprietary OCS technology platform and organ-specific OCS products; obtaining clinical evidence for the safety and effectiveness of our OCS products through clinical trials; securing regulatory approval; organizing and staffing our company; planning our business; raising capital; and providing general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from sales of preferred stock and borrowings under loan agreements, proceeds from the sale of common stock in our IPO and revenue from clinical trials and commercial sales of our OCS products.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate net revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful further development and commercialization of our products. We generated net revenue of $23.6 million and $13.0 million for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. We incurred net losses of $33.5 million and $23.8 million, respectively, for those same years. As of December 28, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $369.5 million. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we focus on growing commercial sales of our products in both the U.S. and select non-U.S. markets, including growing our sales and clinical adoption team, which will pursue increasing commercial sales and clinical adoption of our OCS products; scaling our manufacturing operations; continuing research, development and clinical trial efforts; and seeking regulatory clearance for new products and product enhancements, including new indications, in both the U.S. and select non-U.S. markets. Further, following the closing of our IPO we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. As a result, we will need substantial additional funding for expenses related to our operating activities, including selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and clinical trials expenses.\nOn May 6, 2019, we completed our IPO, pursuant to which we issued and sold 6,543,500 shares of common stock, inclusive of 853,500 shares we sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. The aggregate net proceeds received by us from the IPO were $91.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions as well as other offering costs of $6.0 million.\nOn May 6, 2019, immediately prior to the completion of our IPO, we completed a corporate reorganization whereby TransMedics, Inc., the direct parent of TransMedics Group, Inc. prior to the corporate reorganization, became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of TransMedics Group, Inc. pursuant to the merger of TMDX, Inc., a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of TransMedics Group, Inc. prior to the corporate reorganization, merged with and into TransMedics, Inc., with TransMedics, Inc. as the surviving corporation. As part of the transactions, each outstanding share of capital stock of TransMedics, Inc. was converted into shares of common stock of TransMedics Group, Inc. each outstanding option to purchase shares of common stock of TransMedics, Inc. was converted into an outstanding option to purchase shares of common stock of TransMedics Group, Inc. and each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of preferred stock of TransMedics, Inc. was converted into a warrant to purchase shares of common stock of TransMedics Group, Inc..\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial net revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and strategic alliances. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the further development and commercialization efforts of one or more of our products, or may be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nWe believe that the net proceeds from our IPO, together with our cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities, will enable us to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and debt service payments for at least the next 12 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nNet Revenue\nWe generate revenue primarily from sales of our single-use, organ-specific disposable sets (i.e., our organ-specific OCS Perfusion Sets sold together with our organ-specific OCS Solutions) used on our organ-specific OCS Consoles, each being a component of our OCS products. To a lesser extent, we also generate revenue from the sale of OCS Consoles to customers and from the implied rental of OCS Consoles loaned to customers at no charge. For each new transplant procedure, customers purchase an additional OCS disposable set for use on the customer's existing organ-specific OCS Console.\nAll of our revenue has been generated by sales to transplant centers in the United States, Europe and Asia-Pacific, or, in some cases, to distributors selling to transplant centers in select countries. Substantially all of our customer arrangements have multiple-performance obligations that contain deliverables consisting of OCS Perfusion Sets and OCS Solutions. In some of those multiple-element arrangements, the deliverables also include an OCS Console, whether sold or loaned to the customer.\nSome of our revenue has been generated from products sold in conjunction with the clinical trials conducted for our OCS products, under arrangements referred to as customer clinical trial agreements. Under most of these customer clinical trial agreements, we place an organ-specific OCS Console at the customer site for its use free of charge for the duration of the clinical trial, and the customer separately purchases from us the OCS disposable sets used in each transplant procedure during the clinical trial. When we loan the OCS Console to the customer, we retain title to the console at all times and do not require minimum purchase commitments from the customer related to any OCS products. In such cases, we invoice the customer for OCS disposable sets based on customer orders received for each new transplant procedure and the prices set forth in the customer agreement. Over time, we typically recover the cost of the loaned OCS Console through the customer's continued purchasing and use of additional OCS disposable sets. For these reasons, we have determined that part of the arrangement consideration for the disposable set is an implied rental payment for use of the OCS Console. We intend to continue to loan OCS Consoles to some of our customers during commercialization of our OCS products.\nBecause all elements of a customer order are delivered and recognized as revenue at the same time and because revenue allocated to elements other than OCS disposable sets, such as implied rental income and service revenue, is insignificant, all elements of revenue from customer arrangements are classified as a single category of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.\nUnder some of our customer clinical trial agreements, we make payments to our customers for reimbursements of clinical trial materials and for specified clinical documentation related to their use of our OCS products. Because some of these payments do not provide us with a separately identifiable benefit, we record such payments as a reduction of revenue from the customer, resulting in our net revenue presentation. We recorded reimbursable clinical trial costs as a reduction of revenue of $2.2 million and $1.6 million for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively.\nPrior to the fourth quarter of 2018, all of our net revenue in the United States had been generated from sales of OCS disposable sets sold in conjunction with clinical trials conducted for our OCS products. In March 2018, we received our first PMA for the OCS Lung, and we began commercial sales of this product in the United States during the fourth quarter of 2018. Therefore, commencing in the fourth quarter of 2018, our net revenue in the United States is derived from both clinical trial sales and commercial sales and consists primarily of sales of OCS disposable sets and, to a much lesser extent, sales of OCS Consoles. In May 2019, we received our second FDA PMA approval for the OCS Lung for additional clinical indications. We expect to continue to have U.S. clinical trial sales for our OCS Heart and OCS Liver products until we receive similar FDA PMA approvals for those products.\nHistorically, our net revenue in the United States fluctuated from period to period as a result of the timing of patient enrollment in our clinical trials. Our net revenue during periods of patient enrollment has been higher due to the sale of OCS disposable sets for use during these clinical trials, as compared to periods during which our clinical trials were not actively enrolled. Our OCS Heart EXPAND Trial began patient enrollment in September 2015 and completed patient enrollment in March 2018. Our Liver PROTECT Trial began enrollment in January 2016 and completed enrollment in October 2019. Our OCS Lung EXPAND II Trial began patient enrollment in March 2018 and has stopped enrollment as of June 24, 2019 since we received FDA PMA approval for the OCS Lung EXPAND indication. Our OCS Heart EXPAND CAP Trial and our OCS Heart DCD Trial began patient enrollment in May 2019 and December 2019, respectively, and are currently enrolling patients. Our OCS Liver PROTECT CAP Trial began patient enrollment in February 2020 and is currently enrolling patients. Our net revenue may continue to fluctuate from period to period as a result of the timing of ongoing clinical trials in which our OCS products are used.\nThrough December 28, 2019, all of our sales outside of the United States have been commercial sales (unrelated to any clinical trials) and our net revenue has been generated primarily from sales of OCS disposable sets and, to a much lesser extent, sales of OCS Consoles. Commercial sales of OCS disposable sets generally have a higher average selling price than clinical trial sales of OCS disposable sets.\nWe expect that our net revenue will increase in the future as a result of receiving our first two FDA PMA approvals for the OCS Lung in the United States in March 2018 and May 2019 and any potential future FDA approvals in the United States for OCS Heart and OCS Liver. We also expect that our net revenue will increase as a result of anticipated growth in non-U.S. sales if national healthcare systems begin to reimburse transplant centers for the use of the OCS, if transplant centers utilize the OCS in more transplant cases, and if more transplant centers adopt the OCS in their programs.\nOur consolidated financial results for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 reflect our adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as of December 30, 2018, applied using the modified retrospective method. Under this method, (i) the new guidance was applied to customer contracts that were not yet completed as of December 29, 2018, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance being recorded as an adjustment to accumulated deficit on the effective date of adoption, and (ii) our historical results for all periods prior to December 30, 2018, including for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 are not adjusted. Our adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, and the revenue recognition of our OCS products remained substantially unchanged. The impact of the adoption of ASC 606 on our consolidated financial statements is described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nCost of revenue consists primarily of costs of components of our OCS Consoles and disposable sets, costs of direct materials, labor and the manufacturing overhead that directly supports production, and costs related to the depreciation of OCS Consoles loaned to customers. When we loan an OCS Console to a customer for its use free of charge, we capitalize as property and equipment the cost of our OCS Console and depreciate these assets over the five-year estimated useful life of the console.\nIncluded in the cost of disposable sets is the cost of our OCS Lung, OCS Heart and OCS Liver Solutions. In the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, if we did not meet our annual obligation to purchase minimum quantities from our supplier of OCS Lung Solution, we were obligated to pay a premium equal to the order shortfall multiplied by a specified price. We capitalized any estimated premium we expected to pay at the end of each year as an adjustment to the inventory cost of OCS Lung Solution ordered during that year. The capitalized inventory adjustment is recognized as a component of cost of revenue when related OCS disposable sets are sold.\nWe expect that cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollars primarily as, and to the extent that, our net revenue increases.\nGross profit is the amount by which our net revenue exceeds our cost of revenue in each reporting period. We calculate gross margin as gross profit divided by net revenue. Our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, primarily production volumes, the cost of components and direct materials, manufacturing costs, headcount, the selling price of our OCS products and fluctuations in amounts paid by us to customers related to reimbursements of their clinical trial expenses.\nWe expect that cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue will decrease and gross margin and gross profit will increase over the long term as our sales and production volumes increase and our cost per unit of our disposable sets decreases due to efficiencies of scale. We intend to use our design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities to further advance and improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes, which we believe will reduce costs and increase our gross margin. As utilization by customers of our OCS products increases, we expect that a greater number of OCS disposable sets will be used per year on the same OCS Console, thereby driving overall gross margin improvement. Because we expect that the number of OCS disposable sets sold over time will be significantly greater than the number of OCS Consoles sold or loaned to customers over that same period, we expect that our gross margin improvement will not be significantly affected by the number of OCS Consoles that we sell or loan to customers. While we expect gross margin to increase over the long term, it will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch, Development and Clinical Trials Expenses\nResearch, development and clinical trials expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, product development, hardware and software engineering, clinical trials to develop clinical evidence of our products' safety and effectiveness, regulatory expenses, testing, consultant services and other costs associated with our OCS technology platform and OCS products, which include:\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research, hardware and software development, regulatory and clinical trial functions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> expenses incurred in connection with the clinical trials of our products, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and data management organizations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of maintaining and improving our product designs, including the testing of materials and parts used in our products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> laboratory supplies and research materials; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expense research, development and clinical trials costs as incurred. In the future, we expect that research, development and clinical trials expenses will increase due to ongoing product development and approval efforts. We expect to continue to perform activities related to obtaining additional regulatory approvals for expanded indications in the United States and to developing the next generation of our OCS technology platform.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our sales and clinical adoption team and personnel in executive, marketing, finance and administrative functions. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs, promotional activities, marketing, conferences and trade shows as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting and audit services. We expect to continue to increase headcount in our sales and clinical adoption team and increase marketing efforts as we continue to grow commercial sales of our OCS products in both U.S. and select non-U.S. markets.\nWe expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase as we increase our headcount to support the expected continued sales growth of our OCS products. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance and director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with operating as a public company.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest expense associated with outstanding borrowings under a prior loan agreement and our existing loan agreement as well as the amortization of debt discount associated with such agreements. We expect our interest expense will increase in connection with our Credit Agreement with OrbiMed, under which we borrowed $35.0 million in June 2018. At that time, we repaid the remaining $6.7 million of principal that had been outstanding under our prior loan and security agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, or Hercules, thereby increasing our total debt by $28.3 million.\nChange in Fair Value of Preferred Stock Warrant Liability\nIn connection with our prior loan and security agreement, as amended, with Hercules, we issued warrants to purchase preferred stock. We classified these warrants as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet that we remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, and we recognized changes in the fair value of the warrant liability as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations.\nOn May 6, 2019, immediately prior to the closing of our IPO, the warrants to purchase preferred stock were converted into warrants to purchase common stock, and the fair value of the warrant liability at that time was reclassified to common stock. As a result, subsequent to the closing of our IPO, we no longer remeasure the fair value of the warrant liability at each reporting date.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net includes interest income, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other non-operating income and expense items unrelated to our core operations, including the loss on extinguishment of debt that we recognized in June 2018 in connection with our repayment of borrowings under our loan and security agreement with Hercules.\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our invested cash balances. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses result from intercompany transactions as well as transactions with customers or vendors denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity in which the transaction is recorded.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nSince our inception, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net operating losses we have incurred in each year or for the research and development tax credits we generated in the United States, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will not be realized. In reporting periods subsequent to 2016, we have recorded provisions for foreign income taxes of an insignificant amount related to the operations of one of our foreign subsidiaries.\nAs of December 28, 2019, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $287.8 million and $217.8 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income and begin to expire in 2020 and 2030 respectively. Our federal net operating losses include $72.8 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 28, 2019, we also had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $7.0 million and $4.7 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2020 and 2024, respectively. As of December 28, 2019, we had no foreign net operating loss carryforwards. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date.\nResults of Operations\nOur fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December, and we report fiscal years using a 52/53-week convention. Under this convention, certain fiscal years contain 53 weeks. Each fiscal year is typically composed of four 13-week fiscal quarters, but in years with 53 weeks, the fourth quarter is a 14-week period. Our fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 included 52 weeks.\nComparison of the Fiscal Years Ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018:\nTable 236: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

ended December 28, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 primarily as a result of an increase in the number of OCS disposable sets sold to customers globally.\nNet revenue from customers in the United States was $16.3 million in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 and increased by $9.7 million in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. The increase in net revenue from customers in the United States was primarily due to commercial sales of OCS Lung products, sales of OCS disposable sets for use in our OCS Heart EXPAND CAP Trial and OCS Heart DCD Trial and sales of OCS disposable sets to customers for use in our OCS Liver PROTECT Trial. Net revenue from sales of OCS Lung products in the United States increased from $4.4 million in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 to $8.0 million in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019, and the increase was due to sales of OCS Lung disposable sets. Net revenue from OCS Heart disposable sets sold to customers for use in our OCS Heart EXPAND CAP Trial and OCS Heart DCD Trial increased from $0.0 million in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 to $4.7 million in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019. Net revenue from OCS Liver disposable sets sold to customers for use in our OCS Liver PROTECT Trial increased from $2.0 million in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 to $3.5 million in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019. In addition, the U.S. selling price of OCS disposable sets sold in the fiscal year 2019 was approximately 17% higher than the U.S. selling prices of OCS disposable sets sold in the fiscal year 2018, which accounted for $3.8 million of the overall $9.7 million increase in net revenue in the United States in the fiscal year 2018 to the fiscal year 2019.\nNet revenue from customers outside the U.S. was $7.4 million in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 and increased by $0.9 million compared to the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. The increase in net revenue from customers outside the United States was primarily due to sales of OCS Heart disposable sets to existing customers along with the addition of several new customers in the year.\nThe increases in net revenue by OCS product (i.e., OCS Lung, OCS Heart and OCS Liver) in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 were each primarily due to an increase in the number of OCS disposable sets sold for each organ-specific OCS product.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nCost of revenue increased by $2.5 million in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. Gross profit increased by $8.1 million in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. Gross margin was 59% and 44% for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. Gross profit and gross margin increased primarily as a result of a higher average selling price of OCS disposable sets sold in the United States in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 relative to the average selling price of OCS disposable sets in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 and overall higher sales, which resulted in a reduction of the impact of fixed costs in our manufacturing operation.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch, Development and Clinical Trials Expenses\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel related (including stock-based compensation\nexpense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical trials costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consulting and third-party testing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Laboratory supplies and research materials\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research, development and clinical trials\nexpenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal research, development and clinical trials expenses increased by $6.2 million from $13.7 million in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 to $19.9 million in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019.

All other costs also increased by $3.0 million primarily as a result of increased costs to operate as a public company.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the fiscal year December 29, 2018 consisted of interest on the outstanding borrowings under our loan and security agreement with Hercules and our Credit Agreement with OrbiMed. Our loan and security agreement with Hercules was outstanding through June 22, 2018, when we terminated and repaid in full the borrowings under that agreement and entered into a new Credit Agreement with OrbiMed. Interest expense increased by $1.6 million in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 primarily as a result of a $28.3 million increase in our total outstanding borrowings in June 2018.\nChange in Fair Value of Preferred Stock Warrant Liability\nThe change in the fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 was due primarily to the changes in the fair value of our preferred stock during those periods.\nOn May 6, 2019, immediately prior to the closing of our IPO, the warrants to purchase preferred stock were converted into warrants to purchase common stock, and the fair value of the warrant liability at that time was reclassified to common stock. As a result, subsequent to the closing of our IPO, we no longer remeasure the fair value of the warrant liability at each reporting date.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 included interest income of $1.0 million and $0.3 million, respectively, resulting from interest earned on invested cash balances, and included $0.2 million of foreign currency transaction losses in both periods. Additionally, other income (expense), net for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 included a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.3 million that we recognized in connection with the prepayment of our borrowings under our loan and security agreement with Hercules upon entering into our new Credit Agreement with OrbiMed.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from sales of preferred stock and borrowings under loan agreements, proceeds from the sale of common stock in our IPO and revenue from clinical trials and commercial sales of our OCS products.\nOn May 6, 2019, we completed our IPO, pursuant to which we issued and sold 6,543,500 shares of common stock, inclusive of 853,500 shares we sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. The aggregate net proceeds received by us from the IPO were $91.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions as well as other offering costs of $6.0 million.\nAs of December 28, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $80.7 million.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the fiscal periods presented:\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (32,286\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (25,984\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (60,501\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash\nequivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (82\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents\nand restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (149\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019, operating activities used $32.3 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $33.5 million and net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.6 million, partially offset by net non-cash charges of $2.9 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 consisted primarily of a $4.1 million increase in inventory, a $3.2 million increase in accounts receivable all partially offset by a $5.9 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, operating activities used $26.0 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $23.8 million and net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $4.3 million, partially offset by net non-cash charges of $2.1 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 consisted primarily of a $2.7 million increase in inventory, a $2.5 million increase in accounts receivable and a $1.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, all partially offset by a $2.5 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nChanges in accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities in each reporting period are generally due to growth in our business, including the growth in sales, expenses and employee headcount. Our deferred rent balance will continue to decrease in each reporting period during the remaining term of the leases for our leased property.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019, net cash used by investing activities was $60.5 million, primarily due to the purchases of marketable securities of $82.4 million and purchases of property and equipment of $0.2 million, partially offset by the proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $22.0 million.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, net cash provided by investing activities was $12.3 million, due to the maturities of marketable securities of $12.7 million, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of $0.4 million.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $92.7 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds from issuance of common stock in our IPO that closed in May 2019, partially offset by payment of offering costs related to our IPO.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $22.1 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds from borrowings under our Credit Agreement with OrbiMed of $33.4 million, partially offset by the repayment of our previously outstanding borrowings under our loan and security agreement with Hercules of $9.1 million, representing principal of $8.5 million and the end-of-term payment of $0.6 million, and the payment of $2.3 million of offering costs related to our IPO.\nLong-Term Debt\nIn June 2018, TransMedics entered into the Credit Agreement with OrbiMed, pursuant to which it borrowed $35.0 million.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at an annual rate equal to the LIBOR subject to a minimum of 1.0% and a maximum of 4.0%, plus 8.5%, or the Applicable Margin, subject in the aggregate to a maximum interest rate of 11.5%. In addition, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear paid-in-kind, or PIK interest, at an annual rate equal to the amount by which LIBOR plus the Applicable Margin exceeds 11.5%, but not to exceed 12.5%. The PIK interest is added to the principal amount of the borrowings outstanding at the end of each quarter until the maturity date of the Credit Agreement in June 2023. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are repayable in quarterly interest-only payments until the maturity date, at which time all principal and accrued interest is due and payable. At our option, we may prepay outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, subject to a prepayment premium of 9.0% of the principal amount of any prepayment within the first three years, which percentage decreases annually until it reaches zero at the end of three years. We are also required to make a final payment in an amount equal to 3.0% of the principal amount of any prepayment or repayment, which we are accreting to interest expense over the term of the Credit Agreement using the effective interest method.\nAll obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by us and each of our material subsidiaries. All obligations of us and each guarantor are secured by substantially all of our and each guarantor's assets, including their intellectual property, subject to certain exceptions, including a perfected security interest in substantially all tangible and intangible assets of us and each guarantor. Under the Credit Agreement, we have agreed to certain affirmative and negative covenants to which we will remain subject until maturity. The covenants include maintaining a minimum liquidity amount of $3.0 million; the requirement, on an annual basis, to deliver to OrbiMed annual audited financial statements with an unqualified audit opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm; and restrictions on our activities, including limitations on dispositions, mergers or acquisitions; encumbering our intellectual property; incurring indebtedness or liens; paying dividends; making certain investments; and engaging in certain other business transactions. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of specified events of default, including payment default, change in control, bankruptcy, insolvency, certain defaults under other material debt, certain events with respect to governmental approvals (if such events could cause a material adverse change in our business), failure to comply with certain covenants. including the minimum liquidity and unqualified audit opinion covenants, and a material adverse change in our business, operations or other financial condition. As of December 28, 2019, we were in compliance with all of the other covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nUpon the occurrence of an event of default and until such event of default is no longer continuing, the Applicable Margin will increase by 4.0% per annum. If an event of default (other than certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency) occurs and is continuing, OrbiMed may declare all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the borrowings plus accrued and unpaid interest to be due and payable. Upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all of the outstanding principal amount of the borrowings plus accrued and unpaid interest will automatically become due and payable. In addition, we may be required to prepay outstanding borrowings, subject to certain exceptions, with portions of net cash proceeds of certain asset sales and certain casualty and condemnation events.\nIn June 2018, we repaid all amounts due under our 2015 loan and security agreement with Hercules and the loan and security agreement was terminated.\nFunding Requirements\nAs we continue to pursue and increase commercial sales of our OCS products, we expect our costs and expenses to increase in the future, particularly as we expand our sales and clinical adoption team, scale our manufacturing operation, continue research, development and clinical trial efforts, and seek regulatory clearance for new products and product enhancements, including new indications, both in the United States and in select non-U.S. markets. In addition, following the closing of our IPO, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. The timing and amount of our operating and capital expenditures will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 241: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the amount of net revenue generated by sales of our OCS Consoles, OCS disposable sets and other products that may be approved in the United States and select non-U.S. markets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs and expenses of expanding our U.S. and non-U.S. sales and marketing infrastructure and our manufacturing operations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the extent to which our OCS products are adopted by the transplant community;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 244: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the ability of our customers to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed using the OCS products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 245: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the degree of success we experience in commercializing our OCS products for additional indications;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs, timing and outcomes of any future clinical studies and regulatory reviews, including to seek and obtain approvals for new indications for our OCS products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the emergence of competing or complementary technologies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 248: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the number and types of future products we develop and commercialize;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 249: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 250: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the level of our selling, general and administrative expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements, and debt service payments for at least twelve months following the filing of our annual report on Form 10-K.\nWe may need to raise additional funding, which might not be available on favorable terms or at all.

For purposes of this table, the interest due under the Credit Agreement was calculated using an assumed interest rate of 10.63% per annum, which was the interest rate in effect as of December 28, 2019. Because such interest rate is below the PIK interest threshold of 11.5%, we did not include PIK in our calculated payments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 29, 2018, we were obligated to pay financing fees of $1.5 million to our former financial advisors related to issuances of Series B preferred stock and Series D preferred stock in periods prior to 2016. These financing fees were contingently payable in cash only upon an initial public offering or certain alternative transactions, including a sale of our company. As a result of the IPO in May 2019, we became obligated to pay these previously accrued financing fees. We settled the obligations in full during the third and fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019.\nWe also enter into other contracts in the normal course of business with consulting firms, material suppliers and other third parties for clinical trials and testing and manufacturing services. These contracts do not contain minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable by us upon prior written notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including noncancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation. These payments are not included in the table above as the amount and timing of such payments are not known.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue primarily from sales of our single-use, organ-specific disposable sets (i.e., our organ-specific OCS Perfusion Sets sold together with our organ-specific OCS Solutions) used on our organ-specific OCS Consoles, each being a component of our OCS products. To a lesser extent, we also generate revenue from the sale of OCS Consoles to customers and from the implied rental of OCS Consoles loaned to customers at no charge. For each new transplant procedure, customers purchase an additional OCS disposable set for use on the customer's existing organ-specific OCS Console.\nOn December 30, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, which amended revenue recognition principles and provides a single, comprehensive set of criteria for revenue recognition within and across all industries. The new revenue standard provides a five-step framework whereby revenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize revenue from sales to customers applying the following five steps: (1) identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer, (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied. Because all performance obligations of a customer order are delivered and recognized as revenue at the same time and because revenue allocated to performance obligations other than OCS disposable sets, such as implied rental income and service revenue, is insignificant, all components of revenue from customer arrangements are classified as a single category of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.\nSubstantially all of our customer arrangements have multiple-performance obligations that contain deliverables consisting of OCS Perfusion Sets and OCS Solutions. In some of those multiple-performance obligation arrangements, the deliverables also include an OCS Console, whether sold or loaned to the customer. We evaluate each promise within a multiple-performance obligation arrangement to determine whether it represents a distinct performance obligation. A performance obligation is distinct if (1) the product or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract and (2) the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer.\nWhen a customer order includes an OCS Console, whether sold or loaned, we have determined that customer training and the equipment set-up of the OCS Console, each performed by us, are not distinct because they are not sold on a standalone basis and can only be performed by us in conjunction with a sale or loan of our OCS Console. In addition, we have determined that the OCS Console itself is not distinct because the customer cannot benefit from the OCS Console without the training and equipment set-up having been completed. As a result, when the order includes an OCS Console, we have concluded that training, OCS Console equipment set-up, and the OCS Console itself are highly interdependent and represent a single, combined performance obligation. Consequently, we do not recognize any revenue from any component of a customer order that includes an OCS Console, whether sold or loaned, until the OCS Console has arrived at the customer site and the training and equipment set-up have been completed by us. We have concluded that transfer of control\u201d of an OCS Console occurs only after the console has arrived at the customer site and the training and equipment set-up have been completed by us.\nSome of our revenue has been generated from products sold in conjunction with the clinical trials conducted for our OCS products, under arrangements referred to as customer clinical trial agreements. Under most of these customer clinical trial agreements, we place an organ-specific OCS Console at the customer site for its use free of charge for the duration of the clinical trial, and the customer separately purchases from us the OCS disposable sets used in each transplant procedure during the clinical trial. When we loan the OCS Console to the customer, we retain title to the console at all times and do not require minimum purchase commitments from the customer related to any OCS products. In such cases, we invoice the customer for OCS disposable sets based on customer orders received for each new transplant procedure and the prices set forth in the customer agreement. Over time, we typically recover the cost of the loaned OCS Console through the customer's continued purchasing and use of additional OCS disposable sets. For these reasons, we have determined that part of the arrangement consideration for the disposable set is an implied rental payment for use of the OCS Console.\nWhen a customer arrangement contains multiple-performance obligations that include a loan of an OCS Console for the customer's use at the customer site as well as OCS disposable sets that are delivered simultaneously, we allocate the arrangement consideration between the lease deliverables (i.e., the OCS Console) and non-lease deliverables (i.e., the OCS disposable sets) based on the relative estimated standalone selling price, or SSP, of each distinct performance obligation. To date, the amounts allocated to lease deliverables have been insignificant. In determining SSP, we maximize observable inputs and consider a number of data points, including: (1) the pricing of standalone sales (in instances where available), (2) the pricing established by management when setting prices for deliverables that are intended to be sold on a standalone basis, (3) contractually stated prices for deliverables that are intended to be sold on a standalone basis, and (4) other pricing factors, such as the geographical region in which the products are sold and expected discounts based on the customer size and type.\nRevenue is recognized when control of the OCS product or products is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the product or products.\nPerformance Obligations\nThe primary performance obligations in our customer arrangements from which we derive revenue are as follows:\nTable 254: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> OCS Console-The OCS Console is a medical device that houses and controls the function of the OCS. The performance obligation of the OCS Console includes customer training and equipment set-up. Revenue for each OCS Console is recognized at the point in time at which control is transferred to the customer, which is typically only after the console has arrived at the customer site and the training and equipment set-up have been completed by us because the customer cannot benefit from the OCS Console without the training and equipment set-up having been completed. At that time, we believe control has been transferred to the customer.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 255: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> OCS Perfusion Set-The OCS Perfusion Set is a single-use disposable set that stores the organ and circulates blood. Revenue for each OCS Perfusion Set is recognized at the point in time at which control is transferred to the customer, which is when title transfers to the customer in connection with delivery. In most of our customer arrangements, title to the OCS Perfusion Set transfers when the OCS Perfusion Set arrives at the customer site. In limited instances, title transfers upon shipment by us to the customer.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 256: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> OCS Solutions-The OCS Solutions are a set of nutrient-enriched solutions to optimize the organ's condition outside the human body. Revenue for each OCS Solution is recognized at the point in time at which control is transferred to the customer, which is when title transfers to the customer in connection with delivery. In most of our customer arrangements, title to the OCS Solutions transfers when the OCS Solutions arrive at the customer site. In limited instances, title transfers upon shipment by us to the customer.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPayments Made to Customers\nUnder our customer arrangements that include a customer clinical trial agreement, we receive payments from sales to the customer of its OCS products and also make payments to that customer for reimbursements of clinical trial costs, materials, and for specified clinical documentation related to the customer's use of our OCS products. We also make payments to customers involved in post-approval studies for information related to the transplant procedures performed. We determine the appropriate accounting treatments for these payments depending on the nature of the payment and whether they are for distinct goods or services.\nIn these cases, we have determined that the payments made to the customer for reimbursement of clinical trial materials and its costs incurred to execute specific clinical trial protocols related to our OCS products do not provide us with a distinct good or service transferred by the customer, and, therefore, we record such payments as a reduction of revenue from the customer in our consolidated statements of operations. Reductions of revenue related to such payments made to customers for reimbursements are recognized when we recognize the revenue for the sale of our OCS disposable sets. For the fiscal years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, we recorded as a reduction of revenue $2.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively, of reimbursable clinical trial costs.\nIn these same cases, we have also determined that payments made to the customer to obtain information related to post-approval studies or existing standard-of-care protocols (i.e., unrelated to our OCS products) do meet the criteria to be classified as a cost because we receive a distinct good or service transferred by the customer separate from the customer's purchase of our OCS products and the consideration paid represents the fair value of the distinct good or service received by us. As a result, these payments made by us to customers for information related to post-approval studies or standard-of-care protocols are recorded as research, development, and clinical trials expenses. For the fiscal years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, we recorded as research, development and clinical trials expenses $1.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, related to payments made to customers at clinical trial sites for information related to post-approval studies or existing standard-of-care protocols.\nVariable Consideration\nRevenue is reported net of any taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction (e.g., sales, use, and value added taxes). We only include estimated variable amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.\nRevenue from reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses, including travel, lodging, and meals, is accounted for as variable consideration.\nWe do not consider shipping to be a contract performance obligation. We record shipping costs billed to customers as revenue and records the associated costs incurred by us for those items as cost of revenue.\nOur adoption of ASC 606 as of December 30, 2018 (the beginning of our fiscal year 2019) did not substantially change the revenue recognition of our OCS products as applied under the applicable prior revenue recognition guidance, ASC 605.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock-based option awards granted to employees and directors and, commencing December 30, 2018, to non-employees based on their fair value on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Compensation expense for those awards is recognized over the requisite service which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Generally, we issue awards with only service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. We account for forfeitures as they occur and record compensation cost assuming all option holders will complete the requisite service period. If an award is forfeited, the Company reverses compensation expense previously recognized in the period the award is forfeited.\nPrior to our adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, as of December 30, 2018, we measured the fair value of stock-based option awards granted to non-employees on the date that the related service was complete, which was generally the vesting date of the award. Prior to the service completion date, compensation expense was recognized over the period during which services were rendered by such non-employees. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to the completion of the service, the fair value of these awards was remeasured using the then-current fair value of our common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our common stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our common stock options, and our expected dividend yield.\nDetermination of Fair Value of Common Stock\nPrior to our IPO, the estimated fair value of our common stock had been determined by our board of directors as of the date of each option grant, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuations of common stock, and our board of directors' assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant. These third-party valuations were performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Our common stock valuations were prepared using a Monte Carlo simulation method, which used either a market or income approach to estimate our enterprise value. A Monte Carlo simulation method is used to calculate the value of an enterprise (or other asset) with multiple sources of uncertainty or with complicated features and to allocate the total equity value among the various holders of a company's securities upon the simulated exit using a waterfall. Under this method, the common stock has value only if the funds available for distribution to stockholders exceeded the value of the preferred stock liquidation preferences at the time of the liquidity event, such as a strategic sale or a merger. A discount for lack of marketability of the common stock is then applied to arrive at an indication of value for the common stock. These third-party valuations were performed at various dates, which resulted in valuations of our common stock of $2.21 per share as of May 12, 2016, $3.22 per share as of April 5, 2018 and $8.65 per share as of October 9, 2018 (each amount adjusted for the conversion ratio in the Corporate Reorganization). In addition to considering the results of these third-party valuations, our board of directors considered various objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock as of each grant date, including:\nTable 257: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the prices at which we sold shares of preferred stock and the superior rights and preferences of the preferred stock relative to our common stock at the time of each grant;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 258: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the progress of our research and development, including the status and results of clinical trials to develop clinical evidence of our products' safety and effectiveness and progress of our development of our OCS products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 259: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our stage of development and commercialization and our business strategy;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 260: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> external market conditions affecting the medical device industry and trends within the medical device industry;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 261: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our financial position, including cash on hand, and our historical and forecasted performance and operating results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 262: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the lack of an active public market for our common stock and our preferred stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 263: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale of our company in light of prevailing market conditions; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 264: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the analysis of initial public offerings and the market performance of similar companies in the medical device industry.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe assumptions underlying these valuations represented management's best estimate, which involved inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if we had used significantly different assumptions or estimates, the fair value of our common stock and our stock-based compensation expense could have been materially different.\nFollowing our IPO, in connection with our accounting for granted stock options and other awards we may grant, the fair value of our common stock is determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock.\nValuation of Warrants to Purchase Preferred Stock\nWe classified warrants to purchase shares of our Series D and Series F preferred stock as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as these warrants were free-standing financial instruments that could have required us to transfer assets upon exercise. The warrant liability associated with each of these warrants was initially recorded at fair value on the issuance date of each warrant and was subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Changes in fair value of the warrant liability were recognized as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations. We recognized changes in fair value of each warrant comprising the warrant liability until each respective warrant was exercised, expires or qualifies for equity classification.\nWe utilized the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which incorporated assumptions and estimates to value the preferred stock warrants. We assessed these assumptions and estimates on a quarterly basis as additional information impacting the assumptions was obtained. Estimates and assumptions impacting the fair value measurement included the fair value per share of the underlying Series D and Series F preferred stock, the remaining were contractual term of the warrants, risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield and expected volatility of the price of the underlying preferred stock. The most significant assumption in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model impacting the fair value of the preferred stock warrants was the fair value of our preferred stock as of each remeasurement date. We determined the fair value per share of the underlying preferred stock by taking into consideration our most recent sales of our preferred stock, results obtained from third-party valuations and additional factors that we deemed relevant. As of December 29, 2018, the fair value of our Series D and Series F preferred stock was $6.21 per share and $5.73 per share, respectively. Prior to our IPO, we were a private company and lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information of our stock. Therefore, we estimated expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies for a term equal to the remaining contractual term of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate was determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for time periods approximately equal to the remaining contractual term of the warrants. We estimated a 0% dividend yield based on the expected dividend yield and the fact that we had never paid or declared dividends.\nOn May 6, 2019, immediately prior to the closing of our IPO, the warrants to purchase preferred stock were converted into warrants to purchase common stock, and the fair value of the warrant liability at that time was reclassified to common stock. As a result, subsequent to the closing of our IPO, we no longer remeasure the fair value of the warrant liability at each reporting date.\nValuation of Inventory\nWe value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost computed using the first-in, first-out method. We regularly review inventory quantities on-hand for excess and obsolete inventory and, when circumstances indicate, record charges to write down inventories to their estimated net realizable value, after evaluating historical sales, future demand, market conditions and expected product life cycles. Such charges are classified as cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. Any write-down of inventory to net realizable value creates a new cost basis.\nAt the end of each reporting period, we assess whether losses should be accrued on long-term manufacturing purchase commitments in accordance with ASC 330, Inventory, which requires that losses that are expected to arise from firm, noncancelable and unhedged commitments for the future purchase of inventory, measured in the same way as inventory losses, should be recognized in the current period in the statements of operations unless they are deemed recoverable through firm sales contacts or when there are other circumstances that reasonably assure continuing sales without price decline. As of the end of each reporting period presented in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we did not identify any potential losses arising from remaining future purchase commitments as compared to estimated future customer sales through the remainder of the term of the manufacturing purchase commitment and, as a result, did not recognize in a current period any loss provision for future-period remaining purchase commitments.\nBacklog\nWe define backlog as contractually committed orders for our products for which the associated revenue has not been recognized and the customer has not been invoiced. Amounts that have been invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue are reported as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets and are not included in our calculation of backlog. As of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, we had backlog of $0.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Of the amount of backlog as of December 28, 2019, we expect that substantially all of it will be invoiced to customers within the following 12 months. However, because our customers may cancel, change or reschedule orders without penalty at any time prior to shipment, we have no assurance that we will be able to convert our backlog into shipped orders.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nA description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows is disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of a commercial-stage medical technology company that has developed the Organ Care System (OCS) to transform organ transplant therapy, particularly for lung, heart, and liver transplants.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Item 1.A. Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage medical technology company transforming organ transplant therapy for end-stage organ failure patients across multiple disease states. We developed the OCS to replace a decades-old standard of care that we believe is significantly limiting access to life-saving transplant therapy for hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide. Our innovative OCS technology replicates many aspects of the organ's natural living and functioning environment outside of the human body. As such, the OCS represents a paradigm shift that transforms organ preservation for transplantation from a static state to a dynamic environment that enables new capabilities, including organ optimization and assessment. We believe our substantial body of clinical evidence has demonstrated the potential for the OCS to significantly increase the number of organ transplants and improve post-transplant outcomes.\nWe developed the OCS to comprehensively address the major limitations of cold storage. The OCS is a portable organ perfusion, optimization and monitoring system that utilizes our proprietary and customized technology to replicate near-physiologic conditions for donor organs outside of the human body. We designed the OCS technology platform to perfuse donor organs with warm, oxygenated, nutrient-enriched blood, while maintaining the organs in a living, functioning state; the lung is breathing, the heart is beating and the liver is producing bile. Because the OCS significantly reduces injurious ischemic time on donor organs as compared to cold storage and enables the optimization and assessment of donor organs, it has demonstrated improved clinical outcomes relative to cold storage and offers the potential to significantly improve donor organ utilization.\nWe designed the OCS to be a platform that allows us to leverage core technologies across products for multiple organs. To date, we have developed three OCS products, one for each of lung, heart and liver transplantations, making the OCS the only multi-organ technology platform. Our OCS products have been used for over 1,500 human organ transplants. During our clinical trials, we established relationships with over 55 leading transplant programs worldwide. We have commercialized the OCS Lung and OCS Heart outside of the United States and received our first PMA approval from the FDA in March 2018 for the use in the United States of the OCS Lung for donor lungs currently utilized for transplantation and since May 2019, for donor lungs currently unutilized for transplantation. We expect FDA action over the next six months on additional applications for PMAs we have submitted in connection with our other OCS products.\nSince our inception, we have focused substantially all of our resources on designing, developing and building our proprietary OCS technology platform and organ-specific OCS products; obtaining clinical evidence for the safety and effectiveness of our OCS products through clinical trials; securing regulatory approval; organizing and staffing our company; planning our business; raising capital; and providing general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from sales of preferred stock and borrowings under loan agreements, proceeds from the sale of common stock in our IPO and revenue from clinical trials and commercial sales of our OCS products.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate net revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful further development and commercialization of our products. We generated net revenue of $23.6 million and $13.0 million for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. We incurred net losses of $33.5 million and $23.8 million, respectively, for those same years. As of December 28, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $369.5 million. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we focus on growing commercial sales of our products in both the U.S. and select non-U.S. markets, including growing our sales and clinical adoption team, which will pursue increasing commercial sales and clinical adoption of our OCS products; scaling our manufacturing operations; continuing research, development and clinical trial efforts; and seeking regulatory clearance for new products and product enhancements, including new indications, in both the U.S. and select non-U.S. markets. Further, following the closing of our IPO we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. As a result, we will need substantial additional funding for expenses related to our operating activities, including selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and clinical trials expenses.\nOn May 6, 2019, we completed our IPO, pursuant to which we issued and sold 6,543,500 shares of common stock, inclusive of 853,500 shares we sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. The aggregate net proceeds received by us from the IPO were $91.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions as well as other offering costs of $6.0 million.\nOn May 6, 2019, immediately prior to the completion of our IPO, we completed a corporate reorganization whereby TransMedics, Inc., the direct parent of TransMedics Group, Inc. prior to the corporate reorganization, became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of TransMedics Group, Inc. pursuant to the merger of TMDX, Inc., a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of TransMedics Group, Inc. prior to the corporate reorganization, merged with and into TransMedics, Inc., with TransMedics, Inc. as the surviving corporation. As part of the transactions, each outstanding share of capital stock of TransMedics, Inc. was converted into shares of common stock of TransMedics Group, Inc. each outstanding option to purchase shares of common stock of TransMedics, Inc. was converted into an outstanding option to purchase shares of common stock of TransMedics Group, Inc. and each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of preferred stock of TransMedics, Inc. was converted into a warrant to purchase shares of common stock of TransMedics Group, Inc..\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial net revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and strategic alliances. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the further development and commercialization efforts of one or more of our products, or may be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nWe believe that the net proceeds from our IPO, together with our cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities, will enable us to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and debt service payments for at least the next 12 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nNet Revenue\nWe generate revenue primarily from sales of our single-use, organ-specific disposable sets (i.e., our organ-specific OCS Perfusion Sets sold together with our organ-specific OCS Solutions) used on our organ-specific OCS Consoles, each being a component of our OCS products. To a lesser extent, we also generate revenue from the sale of OCS Consoles to customers and from the implied rental of OCS Consoles loaned to customers at no charge. For each new transplant procedure, customers purchase an additional OCS disposable set for use on the customer's existing organ-specific OCS Console.\nAll of our revenue has been generated by sales to transplant centers in the United States, Europe and Asia-Pacific, or, in some cases, to distributors selling to transplant centers in select countries. Substantially all of our customer arrangements have multiple-performance obligations that contain deliverables consisting of OCS Perfusion Sets and OCS Solutions. In some of those multiple-element arrangements, the deliverables also include an OCS Console, whether sold or loaned to the customer.\nSome of our revenue has been generated from products sold in conjunction with the clinical trials conducted for our OCS products, under arrangements referred to as customer clinical trial agreements. Under most of these customer clinical trial agreements, we place an organ-specific OCS Console at the customer site for its use free of charge for the duration of the clinical trial, and the customer separately purchases from us the OCS disposable sets used in each transplant procedure during the clinical trial. When we loan the OCS Console to the customer, we retain title to the console at all times and do not require minimum purchase commitments from the customer related to any OCS products. In such cases, we invoice the customer for OCS disposable sets based on customer orders received for each new transplant procedure and the prices set forth in the customer agreement. Over time, we typically recover the cost of the loaned OCS Console through the customer's continued purchasing and use of additional OCS disposable sets. For these reasons, we have determined that part of the arrangement consideration for the disposable set is an implied rental payment for use of the OCS Console. We intend to continue to loan OCS Consoles to some of our customers during commercialization of our OCS products.\nBecause all elements of a customer order are delivered and recognized as revenue at the same time and because revenue allocated to elements other than OCS disposable sets, such as implied rental income and service revenue, is insignificant, all elements of revenue from customer arrangements are classified as a single category of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.\nUnder some of our customer clinical trial agreements, we make payments to our customers for reimbursements of clinical trial materials and for specified clinical documentation related to their use of our OCS products. Because some of these payments do not provide us with a separately identifiable benefit, we record such payments as a reduction of revenue from the customer, resulting in our net revenue presentation. We recorded reimbursable clinical trial costs as a reduction of revenue of $2.2 million and $1.6 million for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively.\nPrior to the fourth quarter of 2018, all of our net revenue in the United States had been generated from sales of OCS disposable sets sold in conjunction with clinical trials conducted for our OCS products. In March 2018, we received our first PMA for the OCS Lung, and we began commercial sales of this product in the United States during the fourth quarter of 2018. Therefore, commencing in the fourth quarter of 2018, our net revenue in the United States is derived from both clinical trial sales and commercial sales and consists primarily of sales of OCS disposable sets and, to a much lesser extent, sales of OCS Consoles. In May 2019, we received our second FDA PMA approval for the OCS Lung for additional clinical indications. We expect to continue to have U.S. clinical trial sales for our OCS Heart and OCS Liver products until we receive similar FDA PMA approvals for those products.\nHistorically, our net revenue in the United States fluctuated from period to period as a result of the timing of patient enrollment in our clinical trials. Our net revenue during periods of patient enrollment has been higher due to the sale of OCS disposable sets for use during these clinical trials, as compared to periods during which our clinical trials were not actively enrolled. Our OCS Heart EXPAND Trial began patient enrollment in September 2015 and completed patient enrollment in March 2018. Our Liver PROTECT Trial began enrollment in January 2016 and completed enrollment in October 2019. Our OCS Lung EXPAND II Trial began patient enrollment in March 2018 and has stopped enrollment as of June 24, 2019 since we received FDA PMA approval for the OCS Lung EXPAND indication. Our OCS Heart EXPAND CAP Trial and our OCS Heart DCD Trial began patient enrollment in May 2019 and December 2019, respectively, and are currently enrolling patients. Our OCS Liver PROTECT CAP Trial began patient enrollment in February 2020 and is currently enrolling patients. Our net revenue may continue to fluctuate from period to period as a result of the timing of ongoing clinical trials in which our OCS products are used.\nThrough December 28, 2019, all of our sales outside of the United States have been commercial sales (unrelated to any clinical trials) and our net revenue has been generated primarily from sales of OCS disposable sets and, to a much lesser extent, sales of OCS Consoles. Commercial sales of OCS disposable sets generally have a higher average selling price than clinical trial sales of OCS disposable sets.\nWe expect that our net revenue will increase in the future as a result of receiving our first two FDA PMA approvals for the OCS Lung in the United States in March 2018 and May 2019 and any potential future FDA approvals in the United States for OCS Heart and OCS Liver. We also expect that our net revenue will increase as a result of anticipated growth in non-U.S. sales if national healthcare systems begin to reimburse transplant centers for the use of the OCS, if transplant centers utilize the OCS in more transplant cases, and if more transplant centers adopt the OCS in their programs.\nOur consolidated financial results for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 reflect our adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as of December 30, 2018, applied using the modified retrospective method. Under this method, (i) the new guidance was applied to customer contracts that were not yet completed as of December 29, 2018, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance being recorded as an adjustment to accumulated deficit on the effective date of adoption, and (ii) our historical results for all periods prior to December 30, 2018, including for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 are not adjusted. Our adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, and the revenue recognition of our OCS products remained substantially unchanged. The impact of the adoption of ASC 606 on our consolidated financial statements is described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nCost of revenue consists primarily of costs of components of our OCS Consoles and disposable sets, costs of direct materials, labor and the manufacturing overhead that directly supports production, and costs related to the depreciation of OCS Consoles loaned to customers. When we loan an OCS Console to a customer for its use free of charge, we capitalize as property and equipment the cost of our OCS Console and depreciate these assets over the five-year estimated useful life of the console.\nIncluded in the cost of disposable sets is the cost of our OCS Lung, OCS Heart and OCS Liver Solutions. In the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, if we did not meet our annual obligation to purchase minimum quantities from our supplier of OCS Lung Solution, we were obligated to pay a premium equal to the order shortfall multiplied by a specified price. We capitalized any estimated premium we expected to pay at the end of each year as an adjustment to the inventory cost of OCS Lung Solution ordered during that year. The capitalized inventory adjustment is recognized as a component of cost of revenue when related OCS disposable sets are sold.\nWe expect that cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollars primarily as, and to the extent that, our net revenue increases.\nGross profit is the amount by which our net revenue exceeds our cost of revenue in each reporting period. We calculate gross margin as gross profit divided by net revenue. Our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, primarily production volumes, the cost of components and direct materials, manufacturing costs, headcount, the selling price of our OCS products and fluctuations in amounts paid by us to customers related to reimbursements of their clinical trial expenses.\nWe expect that cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue will decrease and gross margin and gross profit will increase over the long term as our sales and production volumes increase and our cost per unit of our disposable sets decreases due to efficiencies of scale. We intend to use our design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities to further advance and improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes, which we believe will reduce costs and increase our gross margin. As utilization by customers of our OCS products increases, we expect that a greater number of OCS disposable sets will be used per year on the same OCS Console, thereby driving overall gross margin improvement. Because we expect that the number of OCS disposable sets sold over time will be significantly greater than the number of OCS Consoles sold or loaned to customers over that same period, we expect that our gross margin improvement will not be significantly affected by the number of OCS Consoles that we sell or loan to customers. While we expect gross margin to increase over the long term, it will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch, Development and Clinical Trials Expenses\nResearch, development and clinical trials expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, product development, hardware and software engineering, clinical trials to develop clinical evidence of our products' safety and effectiveness, regulatory expenses, testing, consultant services and other costs associated with our OCS technology platform and OCS products, which include:\n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research, hardware and software development, regulatory and clinical trial functions; \n \u2022 expenses incurred in connection with the clinical trials of our products, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and data management organizations; \n \u2022 the cost of maintaining and improving our product designs, including the testing of materials and parts used in our products; \n \u2022 laboratory supplies and research materials; and \n \u2022 facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance. \nWe expense research, development and clinical trials costs as incurred. In the future, we expect that research, development and clinical trials expenses will increase due to ongoing product development and approval efforts. We expect to continue to perform activities related to obtaining additional regulatory approvals for expanded indications in the United States and to developing the next generation of our OCS technology platform.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our sales and clinical adoption team and personnel in executive, marketing, finance and administrative functions. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs, promotional activities, marketing, conferences and trade shows as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting and audit services. We expect to continue to increase headcount in our sales and clinical adoption team and increase marketing efforts as we continue to grow commercial sales of our OCS products in both U.S. and select non-U.S. markets.\nWe expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase as we increase our headcount to support the expected continued sales growth of our OCS products. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance and director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with operating as a public company.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest expense associated with outstanding borrowings under a prior loan agreement and our existing loan agreement as well as the amortization of debt discount associated with such agreements. We expect our interest expense will increase in connection with our Credit Agreement with OrbiMed, under which we borrowed $35.0 million in June 2018. At that time, we repaid the remaining $6.7 million of principal that had been outstanding under our prior loan and security agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, or Hercules, thereby increasing our total debt by $28.3 million.\nChange in Fair Value of Preferred Stock Warrant Liability\nIn connection with our prior loan and security agreement, as amended, with Hercules, we issued warrants to purchase preferred stock. We classified these warrants as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet that we remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, and we recognized changes in the fair value of the warrant liability as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations.\nOn May 6, 2019, immediately prior to the closing of our IPO, the warrants to purchase preferred stock were converted into warrants to purchase common stock, and the fair value of the warrant liability at that time was reclassified to common stock. As a result, subsequent to the closing of our IPO, we no longer remeasure the fair value of the warrant liability at each reporting date.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net includes interest income, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other non-operating income and expense items unrelated to our core operations, including the loss on extinguishment of debt that we recognized in June 2018 in connection with our repayment of borrowings under our loan and security agreement with Hercules.\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our invested cash balances. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses result from intercompany transactions as well as transactions with customers or vendors denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity in which the transaction is recorded.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nSince our inception, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net operating losses we have incurred in each year or for the research and development tax credits we generated in the United States, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will not be realized. In reporting periods subsequent to 2016, we have recorded provisions for foreign income taxes of an insignificant amount related to the operations of one of our foreign subsidiaries.\nAs of December 28, 2019, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $287.8 million and $217.8 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income and begin to expire in 2020 and 2030 respectively. Our federal net operating losses include $72.8 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 28, 2019, we also had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $7.0 million and $4.7 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2020 and 2024, respectively. As of December 28, 2019, we had no foreign net operating loss carryforwards. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date.\nResults of Operations\nOur fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December, and we report fiscal years using a 52/53-week convention. Under this convention, certain fiscal years contain 53 weeks. Each fiscal year is typically composed of four 13-week fiscal quarters, but in years with 53 weeks, the fourth quarter is a 14-week period. Our fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 included 52 weeks.\nComparison of the Fiscal Years Ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018:\n\nNet Revenue, Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit\n\nNet revenue increased by $10.6 million in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 primarily as a result of an increase in the number of OCS disposable sets sold to customers globally.\nNet revenue from customers in the United States was $16.3 million in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 and increased by $9.7 million in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. The increase in net revenue from customers in the United States was primarily due to commercial sales of OCS Lung products, sales of OCS disposable sets for use in our OCS Heart EXPAND CAP Trial and OCS Heart DCD Trial and sales of OCS disposable sets to customers for use in our OCS Liver PROTECT Trial. Net revenue from sales of OCS Lung products in the United States increased from $4.4 million in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 to $8.0 million in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019, and the increase was due to sales of OCS Lung disposable sets. Net revenue from OCS Heart disposable sets sold to customers for use in our OCS Heart EXPAND CAP Trial and OCS Heart DCD Trial increased from $0.0 million in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 to $4.7 million in the fiscal year ended December 28,", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Because some of these payments do not provide us with a separately identifiable benefit, we record such payments as a reduction of revenue from the customer, resulting in our net revenue presentation. We recorded reimbursable clinical trial costs as a reduction of revenue of $2.2 million and $1.6 million for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively.\nPrior to the fourth quarter of 2018, all of our net revenue in the United States had been generated from sales of OCS disposable sets sold in conjunction with clinical trials conducted for our OCS products. In March 2018, we received our first PMA for the OCS Lung, and we began commercial sales of this product in the United States during the fourth quarter of 2018. Therefore, commencing in the fourth quarter of 2018, our net revenue in the United States is derived from both clinical trial sales and commercial sales and consists primarily of sales of OCS disposable sets and, to a much lesser extent, sales of OCS Consoles. In May 2019, we received our second FDA PMA approval for the OCS Lung for additional clinical indications. We expect to continue to have U.S. clinical trial sales for our OCS Heart and OCS Liver products until we receive similar FDA PMA approvals for those products.\nHistorically, our net revenue in the United States fluctuated from period to period as a result of the timing of patient enrollment in our clinical trials. Our net revenue during periods of patient enrollment has been higher due to the sale of OCS disposable sets for use during these clinical trials, as compared to periods during which our clinical trials were not actively enrolled. Our OCS Heart EXPAND Trial began patient enrollment in September 2015 and completed patient enrollment in March 2018. Our Liver PROTECT Trial began enrollment in January 2016 and completed enrollment in October 2019. Our OCS Lung EXPAND II Trial began patient enrollment in March 2018 and has stopped enrollment as of June 24, 2019 since we received FDA PMA approval for the OCS Lung EXPAND indication. Our OCS Heart EXPAND CAP Trial and our OCS Heart DCD Trial began patient enrollment in May 2019 and December 2019, respectively, and are currently enrolling patients. Our OCS Liver PROTECT CAP Trial began patient enrollment in February 2020 and is currently enrolling patients. Our net revenue may continue to fluctuate from period to period as a result of the timing of ongoing clinical trials in which our OCS products are used.\nThrough December 28, 2019, all of our sales outside of the United States have been commercial sales (unrelated to any clinical trials) and our net revenue has been generated primarily from sales of OCS disposable sets and, to a much lesser extent, sales of OCS Consoles. Commercial sales of OCS disposable sets generally have a higher average selling price than clinical trial sales of OCS disposable sets.\nWe expect that our net revenue will increase in the future as a result of receiving our first two FDA PMA approvals for the OCS Lung in the United States in March 2018 and May 2019 and any potential future FDA approvals in the United States for OCS Heart and OCS Liver. We also expect that our net revenue will increase as a result of anticipated growth in non-U.S. sales if national healthcare systems begin to reimburse transplant centers for the use of the OCS, if transplant centers utilize the OCS in more transplant cases, and if more transplant centers adopt the OCS in their programs.\nOur consolidated financial results for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 reflect our adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as of December 30, 2018, applied using the modified retrospective method. Under this method, (i) the new guidance was applied to customer contracts that were not yet completed as of December 29, 2018, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance being recorded as an adjustment to accumulated deficit on the effective date of adoption, and (ii) our historical results for all periods prior to December 30, 2018, including for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 are not adjusted. Our adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, and the revenue recognition of our OCS products remained substantially unchanged. The impact of the adoption of ASC 606 on our consolidated financial statements is described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nCost of revenue consists primarily of costs of components of our OCS Consoles and disposable sets, costs of direct materials, labor and the manufacturing overhead that directly supports production, and costs related to the depreciation of OCS Consoles loaned to customers. When we loan an OCS Console to a customer for its use free of charge, we capitalize as property and equipment the cost of our OCS Console and depreciate these assets over the five-year estimated useful life of the console.\nIncluded in the cost of disposable sets is the cost of our OCS Lung, OCS Heart and OCS Liver Solutions. In the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, if we did not meet our annual obligation to purchase minimum quantities from our supplier of OCS Lung Solution, we were obligated to pay a premium equal to the order shortfall multiplied by a specified price. We capitalized any estimated premium we expected to pay at the end of each year as an adjustment to the inventory cost of OCS Lung Solution ordered during that year. The capitalized inventory adjustment is recognized as a component of cost of revenue when related OCS disposable sets are sold.\nWe expect that cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollars primarily as, and to the extent that, our net revenue increases.\nGross profit is the amount by which our net revenue exceeds our cost of revenue in each reporting period. We calculate gross margin as gross profit divided by net revenue. Our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, primarily production volumes, the cost of components and direct materials, manufacturing costs, headcount, the selling price of our OCS products and fluctuations in amounts paid by us to customers related to reimbursements of their clinical trial expenses.\nWe expect that cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue will decrease and gross margin and gross profit will increase over the long term as our sales and production volumes increase and our cost per unit of our disposable sets decreases due to efficiencies of scale. We intend to use our design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities to further advance and improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes, which we believe will reduce costs and increase our gross margin. As utilization by customers of our OCS products increases, we expect that a greater number of OCS disposable sets will be used per year on the same OCS Console, thereby driving overall gross margin improvement. Because we expect that the number of OCS disposable sets sold over time will be significantly greater than the number of OCS Consoles sold or loaned to customers over that same period, we expect that our gross margin improvement will not be significantly affected by the number of OCS Consoles that we sell or loan to customers. While we expect gross margin to increase over the long term, it will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch, Development and Clinical Trials Expenses\nResearch, development and clinical trials expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, product development, hardware and software engineering, clinical trials to develop clinical evidence of our products' safety and effectiveness, regulatory expenses, testing, consultant services and other costs associated with our OCS technology platform and OCS products, which include:\n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research, hardware and software development, regulatory and clinical trial functions; \n \u2022 expenses incurred in connection with the clinical trials of our products, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and data management organizations; \n \u2022 the cost of maintaining and improving our product designs, including the testing of materials and parts used in our products; \n \u2022 laboratory supplies and research materials; and \n \u2022 facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance. \nWe expense research, development and clinical trials costs as incurred. In the future, we expect that research, development and clinical trials expenses will increase due to ongoing product development and approval efforts. We expect to continue to perform activities related to obtaining additional regulatory approvals for expanded indications in the United States and to developing the next generation of our OCS technology platform.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our sales and clinical adoption team and personnel in executive, marketing, finance and administrative functions. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs, promotional activities, marketing, conferences and trade shows as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting and audit services. We expect to continue to increase headcount in our sales and clinical adoption team and increase marketing efforts as we continue to grow commercial sales of our OCS products in both U.S. and select non-U.S. markets.\nWe expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase as we increase our headcount to support the expected continued sales growth of our OCS products. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance and director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with operating as a public company.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest expense associated with outstanding borrowings under a prior loan agreement and our existing loan agreement as well as the amortization of debt discount associated with such agreements. We expect our interest expense will increase in connection with our Credit Agreement with OrbiMed, under which we borrowed $35.0 million in June 2018. At that time, we repaid the remaining $6.7 million of principal that had been outstanding under our prior loan and security agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, or Hercules, thereby increasing our total debt by $28.3 million.\nChange in Fair Value of Preferred Stock Warrant Liability\nIn connection with our prior loan and security agreement, as amended, with Hercules, we issued warrants to purchase preferred stock. We classified these warrants as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet that we remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, and we recognized changes in the fair value of the warrant liability as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations.\nOn May 6, 2019, immediately prior to the closing of our IPO, the warrants to purchase preferred stock were converted into warrants to purchase common stock, and the fair value of the warrant liability at that time was reclassified to common stock. As a result, subsequent to the closing of our IPO, we no longer remeasure the fair value of the warrant liability at each reporting date.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net includes interest income, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other non-operating income and expense items unrelated to our core operations, including the loss on extinguishment of debt that we recognized in June 2018 in connection with our repayment of borrowings under our loan and security agreement with Hercules.\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our invested cash balances. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses result from intercompany transactions as well as transactions with customers or vendors denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity in which the transaction is recorded.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nSince our inception, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net operating losses we have incurred in each year or for the research and development tax credits we generated in the United States, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will not be realized. In reporting periods subsequent to 2016, we have recorded provisions for foreign income taxes of an insignificant amount related to the operations of one of our foreign subsidiaries.\nAs of December 28, 2019, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $287.8 million and $217.8 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income and begin to expire in 2020 and 2030 respectively. Our federal net operating losses include $72.8 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 28, 2019, we also had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $7.0 million and $4.7 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2020 and 2024, respectively. As of December 28, 2019, we had no foreign net operating loss carryforwards. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date.\nResults of Operations\nOur fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December, and we report fiscal years using a 52/53-week convention. Under this convention, certain fiscal years contain 53 weeks. Each fiscal year is typically composed of four 13-week fiscal quarters, but in years with 53 weeks, the fourth quarter is a 14-week period. Our fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 included 52 weeks.\nComparison of the Fiscal Years Ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018\nThe following table summarizes our

The increase in net revenue from customers in the United States was primarily due to commercial sales of OCS Lung products, sales of OCS disposable sets for use in our OCS Heart EXPAND CAP Trial and OCS Heart DCD Trial and sales of OCS disposable sets to customers for use in our OCS Liver PROTECT Trial. Net revenue from sales of OCS Lung products in the United States increased from $4.4 million in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 to $8.0 million in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019, and the increase was due to sales of OCS Lung disposable sets. Net revenue from OCS Heart disposable sets sold to customers for use in our OCS Heart EXPAND CAP Trial and OCS Heart DCD Trial increased from $0.0 million in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 to $4.7 million in the fiscal year ended December 28,"}
