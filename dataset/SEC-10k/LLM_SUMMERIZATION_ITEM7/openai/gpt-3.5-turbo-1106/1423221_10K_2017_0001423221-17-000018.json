Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on our current assumptions, expectations, estimates and projections about our business and the homebuilding industry, and therefore, it should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, as well as \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" discussed elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a listing of potential risks and uncertainties which impact our business and industry, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Actual results could differ from our expectations due to several factors which include, but are not limited to: market price and demand for our products, economic and competitive conditions, capital expenditures, new technology, regulatory changes and other uncertainties. Unless otherwise required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.\nOur Business\nWe manufacture components for original equipment manufacturers in the building products industry. These components can be categorized as window and door (fenestration) components and kitchen and bath cabinet components. Examples of fenestration components include (1) energy-efficient flexible insulating glass spacers, (2) extruded vinyl profiles, (3) window and door screens, and (4) precision-formed metal and wood products. In addition, we provide certain other non-fenestration components and products, which include solar panel sealants, trim moldings, vinyl decking, fencing, water retention barriers, and conservatory roof components. We use low-cost production processes and engineering expertise to provide our customers with specialized products for their specific window, door, and cabinet applications. We believe these capabilities provide us with unique competitive advantages. We serve a primary customer base in North America and the United Kingdom, and also serve customers in international markets through our operating plants in the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as through sales and marketing efforts in other countries.\nWe continue to invest in organic growth initiatives and have completed several targeted business acquisitions in recent years. We intend to continue to pursue business acquisitions that allow us to expand our existing fenestration and cabinet component footprint, enhance our product offerings, provide new complementary technology, enhance our leadership position within the markets we serve, and expand into new markets or service lines. We have disposed of non-core businesses in the past, and continue to evaluate our business portfolio to ensure that we are investing in markets where we believe there is potential future growth.\nWe currently have three reportable business segments: (1) North American Engineered Components segment ( NA Engineered Components\u201d), comprised of four operating segments primarily focused on the fenestration market in North America manufacturing vinyl profiles, IG spacers, screens & other fenestration components; (2) European Engineered Components segment ( EU Engineered Components\u201d), comprised of our United Kingdom-based vinyl extrusion business, manufacturing vinyl profiles and conservatories, and the European insulating glass business manufacturing IG spacers; and (3) North American Cabinet Components segment ( NA Cabinet Components\u201d), comprised of the North American cabinet door and components business acquired in November 2015, and two wood-manufacturing plants that were transferred from the NA Engineered Components segment during 2017 in order to better align our wood-related products under a common management team. The results of operations and net assets associated with the plant moves is reflected for all applicable periods presented in the accompanying discussion of Results of Operations\u201d and is further described at Note 18, \"Segment Information\", in the accompanying financial statements. We maintain a grouping called Unallocated Corporate & Other, which includes transaction expenses, stock-based compensation, long-term incentive awards based on performance of our common stock and other factors, certain severance and legal costs not allocable to our operating segments, depreciation of corporate assets, interest expense, other, net, income taxes and inter-segment eliminations. Other corporate general and administrative costs have been allocated to the reportable business segments, based upon a relative measure of profitability in order to more accurately reflect each reportable business segment's administrative costs. We allocate corporate expenses to businesses acquired mid-year from the date of acquisition. No change in historical corporate expense allocation has been made to reflect the plant moves noted above as the impact would not have been significant. The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those used to prepare our accompanying consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes corporate general and administrative expense allocated during the years ended October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended October 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NA Engineered Components\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EU Engineered Components\n</td> <td>3,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NA Cabinet Components\n</td> <td>4,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated Corporate & Other\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allocable general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNotable Items\nIn an effort to focus on protecting margins and improving cash flows, we previously announced a strategy to stop manufacturing $65.0 million to $85.0 million of business, thereby reducing our sales volume with certain low-margin customers. During 2017, we have rationalized capacity and closed two United States vinyl plants and two cabinet door plants, relocating assets to improve overall operational efficiency. We have incurred $4.6 million of expense associated with these restructuring efforts during fiscal 2017, and have recognized $6.2 million of accelerated depreciation and amortization associated with related assets.\nOn October 31, 2017, we sold our interest in the net assets of a wood-flooring business to a private equity investor for $0.6 million in cash, and a long-term receivable totaling $1.2 million (payable over a five-year term). We recorded a loss on the transaction of $1.8 million, including deal costs. The transaction is subject to a working capital adjustment.\nOn February 20, 2017, we entered into a $16.6 million capital lease arrangement with a related party to purchase a new manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom, as further described in Note 8, \"Debt and Capital Lease Obligations,\" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein.\nOn November 2, 2015, we acquired Woodcraft, a manufacturer of cabinet doors and other components to OEMs in the kitchen and bathroom cabinet industry. We paid $245.9 million in cash, resulting in goodwill totaling $113.7 million. For additional details of this acquisition, see Note 2, \"Acquisitions and Dispositions,\" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein.\nOn June 15, 2015, we acquired HLP, an extruder of vinyl lineal products and manufacturer of other plastic products incorporated and registered in England and Wales, for $131.7 million in cash, net of cash acquired, $7.7 million of debt assumed and contingent consideration of $10.3 million, resulting in goodwill of approximately $61.3 million. The agreement contains an earn-out provision which is calculated as a percentage of earnings before interest, tax and depreciation and amortization for a specified period, as defined in the purchase agreement. Pursuant to this earn-out provision, the former owner selected the twelve-month period ended July 31, 2016 as the measurement period for the earn-out calculation. On November 7, 2016, we paid $8.5 million pursuant to this earn-out agreement, as further described in Note 2, \"Acquisitions and Dispositions,\" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein.\nMarket Overview and Outlook\nWe believe the primary drivers of our operating results continue to be North American new home construction and residential remodeling and replacement (R&R) activity. We believe that housing starts and window shipments are indicators of activity levels in the homebuilding and window industries, and we use this data, as published by or derived from third-party sources, to evaluate the market. We have historically evaluated the market using data from the National Association of Homebuilders (NAHB) with regard to housing starts, and published reports by Ducker Worldwide, LLC (Ducker), a consulting and research firm, with regard to window shipments. These sources generally provide information about activity levels in the United States.\nHousing starts and window shipments in the United States have increased in recent years. The NAHB has forecasted calendar-year housing starts (excluding manufactured units) at1.2 million units in 2016 and 2017; increasing to 1.3 million units in 2018, reflecting increasing consumer confidence and a healthier economy. Ducker indicated that window shipments in the R&R market are expected to increase to 27.6 million units in 2016, 28.1 million units in 2017, 28.8 million units in 2018 and 29.3 million units in 2019, and new construction window shipments are forecasted to increase at a higher pace. Derived from reports published by Ducker, the overall growth in window shipments for the trailing twelve-month period ended September 30, 2017 was 2.9%. During this period, growth in new construction increased 5.2%, while growth in R&R activity increased 1.2%. Growth in new construction continues to outpace the growth in R&R, with a greater portion of the new construction growth associated with multi-family housing.\nOur HLP business is largely focused on the sale of vinyl house systems under the trade name Liniar\u201d to smaller window manufacturers in the United Kingdom. HLP is one of the larger providers of vinyl extruded product in the United Kingdom in terms of volume shipped. Similar to our domestic business, management evaluates the fenestration market in the United Kingdom using published reports by D&G Consulting, a consulting and research firm, with regard to forecasts of housing starts in the public and private sectors and window shipments. Currently, the United Kingdom is experiencing a shortage in affordable housing, with rising demand due in part to a growing immigrant population. HLP's current primary customers are smaller window fabricators, as opposed to the larger OEMs that comprise a large portion of the North American market. These manufacturers seek the quality and technology of the specific products identified by the Liniar trade name. In addition, HLP services non-fenestration markets including the manufacture of roofing for conservatories, vinyl decking and vinyl water retention barriers used for landscaping. We believe there are growth opportunities within these markets in the United Kingdom and potential synergies which may enable us to sell complementary products.\nWoodcraft manufactures kitchen and bathroom cabinet doors and components, amongst other products, using a variety of woods from traditional hardwoods to engineered wood products. Currently, Woodcraft sells all of its products in the United States, so domestic housing starts and R&R activity constitute the primary drivers of this business as well. We also utilize industry publications to evaluate the wood markets and commodity trends. Although NAHB forecasts indicate expected continued growth in the United States housing market, much of this anticipated growth is in new construction for multi-family dwellings, or rental properties, which is not the primary market for Woodcraft's products. In recent years, forecasts project increased growth in single family homes. The cabinet door market is stratified as follows: stock (low-cost, low-variations), semi-custom (more customized, just-in-time manufacturing, higher price point) and custom (precise customer specifications, just-in-time manufacturing, high-end price point). Woodcraft's primary market is semi-custom.\nOur business is seasonal, particularly our fenestration business, as inclement weather during the winter months tends to slow down construction, particularly as related to outside of the house\u201d construction. To some extent, we believe our kitchen and bathroom cabinet door business lessens the impact of seasonality on our operating results, as the cabinet business is inside of the house\u201d and less susceptible to weather. However, significant weather events do disrupt the construction industry. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma impacted the Southern United States during August and September of 2017. Although our operating plants were not directly impacted, several of our customers were impacted directly, as well as indirectly, as some skilled laborers relocated to the region for construction jobs. From a longer-term perspective, the rebuilding efforts from these storms may spur additional growth in construction during fiscal 2018 and beyond.\nWe are impacted by regulation of energy standards. Although the United States government has been less aggressively pursuing higher energy efficiency standards in recent years, other countries have implemented higher energy efficiency standards which should bode well for our fenestration-related business in these markets, particularly our warm-edge spacer products.\nWe utilize several commodities in our business for which pricing can fluctuate, including polyvinyl resin (PVC), petroleum products, aluminum, TIO2, silicone and wood. For the majority of our customers and critical suppliers, we have price adjusters in place which effectively share the base pass-through price changes for these commodities with our customers commensurate with the market at large. Our long-term exposure to these price fluctuations is somewhat mitigated due to the contractual component of the adjuster program. However, these adjusters are not in place with all customers, and there is a level of exposure to such volatility due to the lag associated with the timing of price updates in accordance with our customer agreements.\nIn July 2016, the United Kingdom voted to exit the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit\u201d), which has impacted the valuation of the British Pound Sterling relative to other currencies used in our business, including our reporting currency, the United States Dollar. Although the British Pound Sterling relative to the United States Dollar appears to have stabilized during fiscal 2017, the Pound remains well below the pre-Brexit level, and some general market uncertainty remains in the United Kingdom. Although we do not know the long-term effects of this change, there has been some impact on our results of operations to date (primarily foreign currency translation).\nThe global economy remains uncertain due to currency devaluations, political unrest, terror threats, and even the political landscape in the United States. These and other macro-economic factors have impacted the global financial markets, which may have contributed to significant changes in foreign currencies. We continue to monitor our exposure to changes in exchange rates.\nWe remain optimistic about our growth prospects in the near-term and believe our restructuring efforts in fiscal 2017 will enhance our financial performance and cash flow generation in fiscal 2018 and beyond.\nComparison of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016\nThis table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the twelve-month periods ended October 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended October 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>866.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>928.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(61.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>672.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>710.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>98.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(800)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>57.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment charges\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>34.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(9.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (expense) benefit\n</td> <td>(6.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>284%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,084)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating results for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 and 2016 include the contributions of Woodcraft acquired on November 2, 2015.

Net sales decreased $63.4 million, or 12%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced a $66.4 million decrease in sales attributable to volume, an increase of $5.4 million related to surcharges for commodities used in our business, primarily resin and aluminum, and a decrease of $2.4 million attributable to price. The significant decrease in volume was anticipated with regard to our previously-announced plan to shed low-margin business associated with our United States vinyl business, although the transition of this volume to other suppliers was at a quicker pace than originally expected. In addition, $2.4 million of the decrease was associated with poor performance of our wood-flooring business which was sold on October 31, 2017. The overall decrease in volume is significantly offset by a corresponding decrease in cost of goods sold including purchases of raw materials used in our manufacturing process and labor, thereby mitigating some of the negative impact on our operating margins. We continue to align our cost structure to counter the effects of the anticipated volume reduction.\nCost of Sales. The cost of sales decreased $41.4 million, or 10%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. This decrease correlates with a 12% decrease in revenues for the respective period. Overall material and labor costs decreased year-over-year, directly related to the lower sales volume, and cost saving measures to align the labor force in light of the decreased volume. In addition, freight and repair and maintenance costs declined, and fixed cost savings were realized due to restructuring efforts in 2017. Consolidated gross margin for the segment declined year-over-year primarily due to\nthe mix of products produced and sold during 2017 compared to 2016, particularly at our United States vinyl operations, and lower volume of solar edge tape sales for our insulating glass business.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $9.2 million, or 15%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Of this decrease, $1.2 million represents a decline in the amount of corporate costs allocated to the segment year-over-year, reflecting an overall decline in such corporate office costs. The remainder of the difference is primarily associated with lower headcount following restructuring efforts at our United States vinyl operations, lower incentive accruals based on financial performance, and lower professional fees. Partially offsetting these declines in expense is a loss on the sale of our wood-flooring business of $1.8 million in October 2017, and normal salary and employee benefit costs inflation.\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges of $3.6 million represent equipment and inventory moving costs incurred in conjunction with the announced closure of two vinyl extrusion plants in the United States, and other related costs including facility lease expense, severance and employee benefit costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $4.5 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to a change in estimate regarding the remaining service lives for assets associated with the restructuring efforts noted above, resulting in incremental depreciation of $3.2 million, and a change in estimate related to certain intangible assets resulting in incremental amortization of $1.6 million. Incremental depreciation expense associated with property, plant and equipment placed in service during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, was more than offset by the run-off of depreciation expense associated with existing assets and disposals during this period.\nAsset Impairment Charges. We recorded an asset impairment charge of $12.6 million in 2016 which represents the write-off of the remaining goodwill asset associated with our United States vinyl extrusion business. We did not incur an asset impairment charge during 2017.\nEU Engineered Components Table 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended October 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>104.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>20.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income margin\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales. Net sales decreased $2.2 million, or 1%, when comparing the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 to the same period in 2016. This decrease is entirely attributable to a $10.7 million negative impact associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, revenue increased $8.5 million, of which $8.6 million related to volume, partially offset by a slight decrease in price of $0.1 million. The volume improvement reflects favorable market growth despite the intentional shed of some lower margin customers at HLP.\nCost of Sales. The cost of sales increased $0.4 million, year-over-year compared to a decrease in revenue for these periods. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate changes as noted above, the increase in cost of goods sold reflects higher material costs, due in part to volume, but also due to higher cost of commodities such as resin and silicone. In addition, margins were impacted during 2017 at HLP due to some inefficiencies caused by delays transitioning to the new warehouse.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expense decreased $2.6 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease reflects a $0.4 million decline in costs allocated from corporate in 2017, as well as lower selling and marketing costs, lower incentive accruals based on earnings, and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.5 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily attributable to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes as well as the timing of new property, plant and equipment placed in service during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, less the run-off of depreciation expense associated with existing assets and disposals during the period.\nNA Cabinet Components\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended October 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>248.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>248.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>213.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>213.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(800)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income margin\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales. Net sales increased $0.7 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced a $0.7 million increase in sales attributable to higher volume, an increase of $2.4 million in revenues associated with pricing, offset by a $2.4 million decrease in revenue associated with lower wood surcharges. The increase in volume reflects market growth of approximately 5%, some new customers, higher-than-expected spot sales, and incremental volume of $1.1 million associated with the two plants transferred from the NA Engineered Components segments. These volume increases are partially offset by volume lost as a result of restructuring efforts that included the closure of a plant in Mexico in October 2016 and a plant in Kansas in September 2017, as well as the previously-announced plan to shed less profitable business. The decrease in revenue associated with wood surcharges represents the change in the price of wood used in our business and the timing lag associated with our contractual ability to pass this cost to our customers.\nCost of Sales. The cost of sales remained consistent at $213.3 million for the years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016. However, the results for 2016 include a charge of $2.3 million related to purchase accounting (step-up and turn of inventory acquired) which did not occur in 2017. Excluding this item, cost of sales increased $2.3 million, or 1%, year-over-year. Margins in 2017 reflect a more favorable product mix, but were negatively impacted by some labor inefficiency, higher health insurance and benefit costs, less favorable material pricing and inventory adjustments and reserves. Overall, cost of sales reflects changes in sales volume and product mix.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expense increased $0.8 million, or 5%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, despite a $0.5 million decrease in allocated corporate costs during this period. The overall $1.3 million increase reflects some additional administrative headcount, normal wage inflation, and higher medical insurance and employee benefit costs year-over-year.\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges of $0.9 million represent equipment moving and other related costs associated with the Mexican plant closure effected in October 2016 and a Kansas plant closure effected in September 2017.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.4 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Of this increase, $0.2 million was associated with accelerated depreciation of assets at the Kansas plant, closed in September 2017. The incremental depreciation and amortization expense associated with property, plant and equipment placed into service during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, slightly exceeded the run-off of depreciation expense associated with existing assets and disposals during this period.\nUnallocated Corporate & Other Table 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended October 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales. Net sales for Unallocated Corporate & Other represents the elimination of inter-segment sales for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 and 2016. The change between periods reflects the amount of inter-segment sales (primarily\nbetween NA Engineered Components and EU Engineered Components related to a change in the terms of a royalty agreement in 2017).\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales for Corporate & Other consists of the elimination of inter-segment profit in inventory and changes in the LIFO reserve adjustments and other costs. The change for the twelve-month periods ended October 31, 2017 and 2016 of $2.6 million was primarily related to the elimination of inter-segment sales and a decrease in the LIFO reserve of $0.3 million in 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $5.9 million, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, despite a $2.1 million decrease in the amount of corporate expense allocated to the operating segments in 2017 compared to 2016. Therefore, the overall decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is $8.0 million. Of this amount, a net decrease of $4.7 million relates to transaction costs, as the prior year included $5.2 million associated with the Woodcraft acquisition. The remainder of the difference relates primarily to lower professional fees as we received $4.0 million of insurance reimbursement in 2017 for legal fees incurred defending an alleged product defect claim. We also recorded lower incentive accruals based on financial performance. These decreases were partially offset by normal wage inflation and higher medical insurance and benefit costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.1 million, or 17%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, reflecting the run-off of depreciation during 2016 primarily related to computer software, hardware and licensing. Relatively few new assets were placed in service at corporate during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017.\nChanges related to Non-Operating Items:\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $26.9 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Of this amount, $16.7 million was attributable to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, original issuer's discount and a 1% prepayment penalty associated with the July 2016 refinance and retirement of our Term Loan B and asset-based lending facilities. This facility was replaced with a Term Loan A and revolving credit facility with significantly lower interest rates. The relative outstanding balances under our credit facilities has decreased at October 31, 2017 compared to October 31, 2016 due to net repayments. The weighted average interest rate for borrowings outstanding for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 was 2.95% compared with 5.26% for the twelve months ended October 31, 2016.\nOther, net. The change in other net of $6.2 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 relates to foreign exchange gains and losses. In 2017, we recorded a gain of $0.7 million and for 2016 we recorded a loss of $5.5 million, largely associated with an unhedged foreign currency position with regard to the borrowings to fund the HLP transaction, as well as net foreign exchange losses associated with our other foreign operations.\nIncome Taxes. We recorded income tax expense of $6.8 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, an effective rate of 26.7%. The effective rate for 2017 was impacted by a $1.0 million discrete benefit associated with a change in the statutory deferred tax rate in the United Kingdom from 19% to 17% over the next three years. We recorded an income tax benefit of $3.7 million, an effective rate of 66.9%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2016. The effective rate for 2016 was impacted by a discrete benefit of $0.8 million for the R&D credit which was made permanent in December 2015. However, this rate was also impacted by permanent items, and the foreign tax rate differential, as a greater percentage of our taxable income for fiscal 2016 was derived from our foreign operations, primarily in the United Kingdom, a jurisdiction with a lower statutory tax rate than the United States.\nComparison of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015\nThis table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the twelve-month periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended October 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>928.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>645.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>282.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>710.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>499.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>211.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>114.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>53.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment charges\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>36.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(36.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,550%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>(5.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,000%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(112)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(112)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating results for the twelve months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 include the contributions of HLP since the date acquired, June 15, 2015.

Net sales increased $4.3 million, or 1%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced an $11.9 million increase in sales attributable to higher volume, partially offset by a decrease of $2.2 million in revenues associated with pricing and a decline of $5.4 million associated with reduced surcharges for commodities used in our business, primarily oil and resin. To a large extent, the increased volume at lower pricing was related to our vinyl extrusion business, as we had lost volume during the first quarter of 2015 with certain profiles for a large customer, and although this volume was replaced during 2016, the mix of earnings was at a lower average price. Our results continue to be impacted by reduced oil surcharges on our butyl-based products due to a dramatic decline in oil prices throughout 2015, remaining relatively low in 2016, as well as reduced surcharges for other materials used in our business including aluminum. The decrease in revenue associated with these surcharges is significantly offset by the decrease in the cost of the raw material used in our manufacturing process, resulting in minimal impact on operating margins.\nCost of Sales. The cost of sales decreased $12.0 million, or 3%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Despite an increase in net sales for these periods, largely due to increased volume as discussed above, cost of sales decreased due to the following: lower year-over-year repair and maintenance costs for our vinyl extrusion business; reduced material costs attributable to lower commodity prices and renegotiated supplier agreements; more favorable inventory turns; and reduced freight cost. Labor costs were relatively flat on higher volume, reflecting some labor efficiencies, and lower worker's compensation insurance costs, partially offset by higher medical insurance costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $3.6 million, or 6%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. This increase was largely due to higher incentive accruals based on earnings, normal salary inflation and higher advertising costs, partially offset by a net gain on the sale of fixed assets of $0.7 million and lower professional fees incurred.\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges of $0.4 million represent severance amounts incurred in conjunction with the announced closure of two vinyl extrusion plants in the United States, and other related severance costs. We substantially completed the plant closures during fiscal 2017 but have not sublet the facilities.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $1.4 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to a change in estimate regarding the remaining service lives for assets associated with the restructuring efforts noted above, resulting in incremental depreciation of $1.0 million, and a change in estimate related to certain intangible assets which provided incremental amortization of $0.3 million. In addition, the incremental depreciation and amortization expense associated with property, plant and equipment and intangible assets placed into service during the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2016, was offset by the run-off of depreciation expense associated with existing assets and disposals.\nAsset Impairment Charges. We recorded an asset impairment charge of $12.6 million in 2016 which represents the write-off of the remaining goodwill asset associated with our United States vinyl extrusion business.\nEU Engineered Components Table 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended October 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>104.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>23.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(77)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(86)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income margin\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales. Net sales increased $56.6 million, or 60%, primarily due to an incremental $57.8 million contribution from HLP in 2016 when compared with the contribution during the period from June 15, 2015 to October 31, 2015. Sales for the British and German IG spacer plants declined $1.3 million for the respective periods, as an increase in sales of $2.4 million associated with higher volume was more than offset by a decrease in sales of $1.0 million related to price and a decrease in sales of $2.7 million related to foreign exchange impact.\nCost of Sales. The cost of sales increased $32.2 million, or 45%, primarily due to an incremental $34.0 million contribution from HLP in 2016 when compared with the contribution during the period from June 15, 2015 to October 31, 2015. Partially offsetting this increase in cost of sales was a decrease of $1.8 million for the British and German plants for the respective periods related to lower material costs in Germany, as a new mixing plant was installed in 2015 which eliminated the cost associated with processing by outside vendors. Otherwise, consistent with the revenue discussion, cost of sales was impacted by the increase in volume in the United Kingdom and Germany, but was offset by lower pricing and the effect of exchange rate changes.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expense increased $10.1 million, reflecting an additional $7.6 million contribution from HLP in 2016 when compared with the contribution during the period from June 15, 2015 to October 31, 2015, with an increase of $0.8 million at the insulating glass plants associated with labor inflation and other expenses, and an incremental corporate allocation of $1.7 million, reflecting a full year allocation for 2016 associated with HLP compared to a 2015 allocation for the period from June 15, 2015 to October 31, 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $4.3 million, reflecting the $4.2 million incremental contribution from HLP in 2016 when compared with the contribution during the period from June 15, 2015 to October 31, 2015. For the European IG Spacer business, incremental depreciation and amortization expense associated with property, plant and equipment placed into service during the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2016, was offset by the run-off of depreciation expense associated with existing assets and disposals during this period.\nNA Cabinet Components\nThe NA Cabinet Components segment reflects the acquisition of Woodcraft as of November 2, 2015 (fiscal 2016), allocated corporate costs for 2016, and the activity of the two wood plants which were transferred from the NA Engineered Components segment, restated as operations of the NA Cabinet Component segment for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended October 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>248.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>221.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>840%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>213.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(878)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,875)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>13.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,600)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income margin\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales. Net sales increased $221.7 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the contribution of Woodcraft of $223.4 million in 2016, partially offset by a $1.7 million decline in sales attributable to the transferred wood plants.\nCost of Sales. The cost of sales increased $191.5 million in 2016 compared to 2015, of which $193.6 million was contributed by Woodcraft, partially offset by a $2.1 million decline in cost of sales attributable to the transferred wood plants. The margin improvement at the plants reflects the mix of third-party sales and inter-company sales between years, as the inter-company activity eliminates in consolidation and does not provide gross margin.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expense increased $15.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015, of which $15.0 million was contributed by Woodcraft, with a slight increase in expense related to the transferred wood plants. The Woodcraft contribution includes $4.8 million of allocated corporate costs.\nRestructuring Charges. The restructuring costs reflect severance and profit-sharing expense accrued related to the Mexican plant which was closed effective October 31, 2016, excluding $0.6 million of such profit-sharing costs included as a liability through purchase accounting.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $13.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015, of which $12.9 million was contributed by Woodcraft, with a slight increase in expense associated with the transferred plants based on the timing of investments in capital expenditures and the normal run-off of depreciation expense.\nUnallocated Corporate & Other Table 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended October 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>(6.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>13.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales. Net sales for Unallocated Corporate & Other represents the elimination of inter-segment sales for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. The change between periods reflects the amount of inter-segment sales (between NA Engineered Components and EU Engineered Components).\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales for Unallocated Corporate & Other consists of the elimination of inter-segment profit in inventory, changes in the LIFO reserve and other costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $0.3 million, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The incremental amount of corporate expense allocated to the divisions for the respective periods was $7.3 million (based on the timing of the HLP and Woodcraft acquisitions, as expense related to HLP was only allocated for the period from June 15, 2015 to October 31, 2015, and no expense was allocated related to Woodcraft for the twelve months ended October 31, 2015). Adjusting for the incremental allocation, selling, general and administrative expense increased $7.0 million for the respective periods. Of this change, $2.8 million related to professional fees, $3.0 million related to stock-based compensation and long-term incentive accruals (primarily related to compensation expense recognized pursuant to performance share awards), with the remainder largely attributable to severance costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.7 million, or 54%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, reflecting the run-off of depreciation during 2015 primarily related to computer software, hardware and licensing. Relatively few new assets were placed in service at corporate during the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2016.\nChanges Related to Non-Operating Items:\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $35.5 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to an increase in borrowings outstanding and fees associated with the refinancing of our debt. In conjunction with the acquisition of Woodcraft on November 2, 2015, we entered into a credit facility which contained a Term Loan B facility and an asset-based lending facility, each at variable interest rates. We borrowed $320.5 million to acquire Woodcraft and to retire then-outstanding borrowings under a predecessor credit facility of $50.0 million. The new credit facilities had higher interest rates, required loan commitment fees and were issued at a discount (resulting in additional interest expense as the discount was accreted over the term of the facilities). On July 29, 2016, we refinanced and retired this debt with a new Term Loan A and revolving credit facility with more favorable interest rates. We incurred a one-time charge of $16.7 million associated with this refinancing which included the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees of $8.1 million, unamortized debt discount of $5.5 million and a prepayment call premium of $3.1 million. Also contributing to the increase in interest expense year-over-year is the expense associated with finance leases assumed with the acquisition of HLP. The interest expense incurred during the twelve months ended October 31, 2015 was significantly less due to the timing of debt incurred to acquire HLP in June 2015. Prior to the HLP acquisition, our debt outstanding was less than $1.0 million.\nOther, net. The increase in other net expense of $5.0 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to net foreign exchange transaction losses associated with an unhedged foreign currency position with regard to the borrowings to fund the HLP transaction, as well as net foreign exchange losses associated with our other foreign operations.\nIncome Taxes. We recorded an income tax benefit of $3.7 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2016, an effective rate of 66.9%. We recorded income tax expense from continuing operations of $7.6 million, an effective rate of 32.6%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2015, which included a discrete benefit of $0.8 million associated with the reversal of a liability for the tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position. Excluding this discrete item, the effective tax rate would have been 36.0% for the twelve months ended October 31, 2015. The difference in the effective rates between these periods is primarily due to the foreign and United States tax rate differential, as the foreign tax rate is generally lower than the United States tax rate and a greater percentage of our taxable income was generated by the foreign operations. The overall change in the effective rate was also impacted by transaction costs and a change in the deferred rate. For additional details, see Note 11, \"Income Taxes\" included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIncome from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax. During the twelve months ended October 31, 2015, we recorded a gain on involuntary conversion of $0.5 million, net of tax, associated with the receipt of insurance proceeds from a fire experienced in 2013 at a facility of a discontinued operation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nHistorically, our principal sources of funds have been cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and borrowings under our credit facilities. As of October 31, 2017, we had $17.5 million of cash and equivalents, $220.7 million outstanding under our credit facilities, $5.3 million of outstanding letters of credit and $18.8 million outstanding under capital leases. We had $210.7 million available for use under the Credit Agreement at October 31, 2017.\nOn November 2, 2015, we acquired Woodcraft for $245.9 million in cash, net of cash acquired, subject to a working capital true-up and including certain holdbacks with regard to potential indemnity claims, as more fully described in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements (Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions\u201d).\nIn order to fund this acquisition, we entered into senior secured credit facilities of $410.0 million consisting of an asset-based lending (ABL) revolving credit facility of $100.0 million (for which the borrowing base was determined monthly) and a Term Loan B facility of $310.0 million. On November 2, 2015, we borrowed $310.0 million under the term loan facility and $10.5 million under the ABL facility to fund the Woodcraft acquisition, to refinance and retire outstanding debt of $50.0 million under a predecessor credit facility and to pay fees associated with these borrowings. The proceeds were reduced by a debt discount of $6.2 million, which was being recognized on the effective interest method over the term of the facility. We recorded expense of $0.5 million in November 2015 to write off the unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the predecessor facility.\nOn July 29, 2016, we refinanced and retired our Term Loan B and ABL credit facilities and entered into a $450.0 million credit agreement comprised of a $150.0 million Term Loan A and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility (collectively, the Credit Agreement\u201d), under which we borrowed $150.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively. The proceeds from the Credit Agreement, along with additional funding of $16.4 million of cash on hand, were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan B and ABL credit facilities of $309.2 million, to pay a 1% prepayment call premium under the Term Loan B facility, to settle\noutstanding interest accrued under the prior facility, and to pay loan fees which totaled $2.8 million. In addition, we expensed $8.1 million to write-off unamortized deferred financing fees and $5.5 million of unamortized original issuer's discount associated with the Term Loan B and ABL credit facilities. The Credit Agreement matures in 2021 (5-year term) and requires interest payments calculated, at our election and depending upon our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, at either a Base Rate plus an applicable margin (0.50% to 1.25%) or the LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin (1.50% to 2.25%). We have included deferred financing fees of $2.8 million as a contra-liability account, and we are amortizing this balance straight-line over the term of the facility.\nThe weighted average interest rate of borrowings outstanding for the twelve-month periods ended October 31, 2017 and 2016 was 2.95% and 5.26%, respectively. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of October 31, 2017. For additional details of the Credit Agreement, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAnalysis of Cash Flow\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow results for the years ended October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: Table 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended October 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows used for investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(41.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(282.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(160.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows (used for) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(45.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>196.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $7.8 million for the year ended October 31, 2017 compared to the year ended October 31, 2016. Despite an increase in net income, cash receipts and disbursements declined as a result of lower activity levels, primarily within our United States vinyl business. Although collection of receivables was favorable, investment in inventory levels grew due to a slower-than-expected busy season, which was exacerbated by the impact of the hurricanes in late 2017. Partially offsetting this decline was the collection of a tax receivable of $1.2 million and lower interest costs under our debt facilities. For the year ended October 31, 2016 compared to the year ended October 31, 2015, cash provided by operating activities increased $19.3 million. A portion of this increase is attributable to the activities of HLP and Woodcraft, acquired in June 2015 and November 2015, respectively. Excluding these acquisitions, our cash receipts increased due to an increase in sales, year-over-year, and more timely collection of receivables. In addition, we invested more in an inventory build in 2015 than in 2016 and we managed our inventory levels more efficiently in 2016. Partially offsetting the favorable operating cash flow derived from these items is a cash outflow related to interest on our debt.\nWorking capital was $85.3 million, $89.8 million and $70.0 million as of October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Working capital remained fairly consistent despite the decrease in activity levels in 2017. For 2016, working capital was impacted by recent acquisitions, notably the Woodcraft acquisition in 2016, as funds were borrowed to complete the transaction and to pay interest associated with the debt, offsetting favorable cash flow from operations. A decrease in cash on hand in 2015 reflected the use of cash to purchase HLP and to acquire our own treasury stock through our share repurchase program.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used for investing activities decreased $241.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016, as the 2016 results included an incremental $237.4 million greater investment in acquisitions, as $245.9 million was incurred in 2016 related to the Woodcraft acquisition and only $8.5 million was paid in 2017 associated with the HLP earn-out. In addition, we invested an incremental $2.7 million in capital equipment in 2016 relative to 2017. For 2016, cash used for investing activities increased $122.0 million compared to 2015. Of this amount, cash used for acquisitions increased $114.2 million reflecting the Woodcraft acquisition in 2016 compared with $131.7 million used in 2015 to acquire HLP. An incremental increase in cash used to invest in capital expenditures year-over-year was $7.3 million, partially offset by a net decrease of $1.3 million associated with the receipt of insurance proceeds, and a net inflow of $0.8 million of proceeds from the sale of capital assets for these periods.\nAt October 31, 2017, we had firm purchase commitments of approximately $1.2 million for the purchase or construction of capital assets. We plan to fund these capital expenditures through cash from operations or borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nFinancing Activities\nOur cash used for financing activities for 2017 was $45.4 million and related primarily to repayment of borrowings under our Credit Agreement, payment of dividends of $5.5 million, partially offset by funds received from the issuance of common stock in settlement of stock option exercises of $8.0 million. For 2016, funds provided by financing activities included net debt borrowings of $209.7 million and cash received of $3.4 million from stock issuances, partially offset by cash paid for debt issuance costs of $11.4 million, cash paid for dividends of $5.5 million, and an incremental $0.2 million provided by other financing activities. For 2015, the net use of cash of $4.6 million reflected the use of $52.7 million to purchase treasury shares, and $5.5 million used to pay dividends, partially offset by net debt borrowings of $49.0 million and cash received of $5.1 million from stock issuances, with a remaining change of $0.5 million attributable to other financing activities.\nLiquidity Requirements\nOur strategy for deploying cash is to invest in organic growth opportunities, develop our infrastructure, make strategic acquisitions and pay cash dividends to our shareholders. We have historically invested cash and cash equivalents in commercial paper with terms of three months or less. To the extent we have excess cash which has not been applied to reduce our outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities, we intend to remain in commercial paper, highly rated money market funds, financial institutions and treasuries following a prudent investment philosophy. From time to time, to prepare for potential disruption in the money markets, we may temporarily move funds into operating bank accounts of highly-rated financial institutions to meet on-going operational liquidity requirements. We did not have any investments during the years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016. We maintain cash balances in foreign countries which totaled $9.0 million and $16.3 million as of October 31, 2017 and 2016. We do not intend to repatriate earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. However, we capitalized HLP with funds on hand and borrowings under our prior credit facility. We utilize cash flow from HLP to fund the operation in the United Kingdom and to repay a note arrangement implemented as part of the initial capitalization of the acquisition.\nWe believe that we have sufficient funds and adequate financial resources available to meet our anticipated liquidity needs. Our cash position has changed due to the acquisitions of HLP and Woodcraft. We expect to use our cash flow from operations to fund operations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. We believe these funds should be adequate to provide for our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and dividends, while continuing to meet our debt service requirements.\nSenior Credit Facility\nWe maintain our $450.0 million Credit Agreement, comprised of a $150.0 million Term Loan A and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Agent, Swingline Lender and Issuing Lender, and Bank of America, N.A. serving as Syndication Agent. The Credit Agreement has a five-year term, maturing on July 29, 2021, and requires interest payments calculated, at our election and depending upon our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, at either a Base Rate plus an applicable margin or the LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin. At the time of the initial borrowing, the applicable rate was LIBOR + 2.00%. In addition, we are subject to commitment fees for the unused portion of the Credit Agreement. The applicable margin and commitment fees range from 0.70% to 2.55%, depending upon the type of loan and consolidated leverage ratio.\nThe term loan portion of the Credit Agreement requires quarterly principal payments on the last business day of each fiscal quarter in accordance with a stated repayment schedule. Required aggregate principal repayments totaling $15.0 million for the succeeding twelve-month period have been included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under the caption Current Maturities of Long-term Debt.\u201d No stated principal payments are required under the revolving credit portion of the Credit Agreement, except upon maturity. If our Consolidated Leverage Ratio is less than 2.25 to 1.00, then we are required to make mandatory prepayments of excess cash flow\u201d as defined in the agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for incremental term loan or revolving credit commitments for a minimum principal amount of $10.0 million, up to an aggregate amount of $150.0 million, subject to the lender's discretion to elect or decline the incremental increase. We can also borrow up to the lesser of $15.0 million or the revolving credit commitment, as defined, under a Swingline feature of the Credit Agreement. We are permitted to prepay the term loan under the Credit Agreement, without premium or penalty, in aggregate principal amounts of $1.0 million or whole multiples of $0.5 million in excess thereof.\nThe Credit Agreement contains a: (1) Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio requirement whereby we must not permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as defined, to be less than 1.10 to 1.00, and (2) Consolidated Leverage Ratio requirement, as summarized by period in the following table:\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maximum Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Closing Date through January 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 31, 2017 through January 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.25 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 31, 2018 and thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.00 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to maintaining these financial covenants, the Credit Agreement also limits our ability to enter into certain business transactions, such as to incur indebtedness or liens, to acquire businesses or dispose of material assets, make restricted payments, pay dividends (limited to $10.0 million per year) and to conduct other transactions as further defined in the Credit Agreement. Substantially all of our domestic assets, with the exception of real property, are pledged as collateral for the Credit Agreement.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our known contractual obligations and commitments as of October 31, 2017: Table 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019-2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021-2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, including interest(1)(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases(3)\n</td> <td>18,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases(4)\n</td> <td>56,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unconditional purchase obligations(5)\n</td> <td>11,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations(6)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>332,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Interest on our long-term debt was computed using rates in effect at October 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Outstanding borrowings under the term loan A portion of the Credit Agreement requires quarterly principal payments with a balloon payment due in July 2021.

Pension contributions beyond 2018 cannot be determined since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension plan assets. Obligations are based on current and projected obligations of the plans, performance of the plan assets, if applicable, and the timing and amount of funding contributions. At October 31, 2017, we have recorded a long-term liability for deferred pension and postretirement benefits totaling $4.4 million. We believe the effect of the plans on liquidity is not significant to our overall financial condition.\nOur supplemental benefit plan and deferred compensation plan liabilities fluctuate based on changes in the market value of certain equity securities, including our common stock. As of October 31, 2017, our liability under the supplemental benefit plan and the deferred compensation plan was approximately $3.4 million and $4.0 million, respectively.\nThe following table reflects other commercial commitments or potential cash outflows that may result from a contingent event.\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019-2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021-2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Commercial Commitments:\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as such term is defined in the rules promulgated by the SEC, that we believe would be material to investors and for which it is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nEffects of Inflation\nAlthough inflation does impact the cost of raw materials, labor and overhead, we are generally able to recover this cost through pricing. The effect of price inflation in the United States in recent years has remained relatively low. Furthermore, inflation on labor rates has been relatively consistent when comparing 2017 to 2016. Therefore, we believe inflation has not had a significant effect on our earnings or financial position.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty. Estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information becomes available and as our operating environment changes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and that we believe provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available through open market quotes. We must use our judgment with regard to uncertainties in order to make these estimates. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe the following are the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as well as the significant judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies. We consider an estimate to be critical if it is subjective and if changes in the estimate using different assumptions would result in a material impact to our financial position or results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when products are shipped and title has passed to the customer. Revenue is deemed to be realized or earned when the following criteria is met: (a) persuasive evidence that a contractual sales arrangement exists; (b) delivery has occurred; (c) the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and (d) collection is reasonably assured. Sales allowances and customer incentives are treated as reductions to revenue and are provided for based on historical experience and current estimates.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe record trade accounts receivable at billed amounts, less an allowance for doubtful accounts. This allowance is established to estimate the risk of loss associated with our trade receivables which may arise due to the inability of our customers to pay or due to changes in circumstances. The allowance is maintained at a level that we consider appropriate based on factors that affect collectability, including: (a) historical trends of write-offs, recoveries and credit losses; (b) the credit quality of our customers; and (c) projected economic and market conditions. Different assumptions or changes in economic circumstances could result in changes to the allowance. Our historical bad debt expense has approximated 0.1% of sales for the years ended October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. If bad debt expense increased by 1% of net sales, the impact on operating results for these years would have been a decrease in net income of $6.4 million, an increase in net loss of $3.1 million, and a decrease in net income of $4.4 million, respectively.\nBusiness Combinations - Contingencies We apply the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net assets and liabilities acquired. We use established valuation techniques and engage reputable valuation specialists to assist us with these valuations. However, there is a risk that we may not identify all pre-acquisition contingencies or that our estimates may not reflect the actual results when realized. We utilize a reasonable measurement period to record any adjustment related to the opening balance sheet (generally, less than one year). After the measurement period, changes to the opening balance sheet can result in the recognition of income or expense as period costs. To the extent these items stem from contingencies that existed at the balance sheet date, but are contingent upon the realization of future events, the cost is charged to expense at the time the future event becomes known. In November 2016, we settled an earn-out provision related to the HLP acquisition for $8.5 million. We used a probability-weighted estimate to value this liability, discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. We recognized the change in this liability as income/expense over time to reflect the time value of money and changes in the probability weighting as to when the former owner would elect a measurement period pay-out. If our purchase accounting estimates are not correct, or if we do not recognize contingent assets or liabilities accurately, we may incur losses.\nImpairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets with Defined Lives\nWe make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of our long-term assets, including property, plant and equipment, and identifiable intangibles. These judgments may include the basis for capitalization, depreciation and amortization methods and the useful lives of the underlying assets. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we review the carrying values of these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We determine that the carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows and after considering alternate uses for the asset, an impairment charge would be recorded in the period in which such review is performed. We measure the impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or by calculating the discounted cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Therefore, if there are indicators of impairment, we are required to make long-term forecasts of our future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. Forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and future market conditions. Although there may be no indicators of impairment in the current period, unanticipated changes to assumptions or circumstances in future periods could result in an impairment charge in the period of the change. No impairment charges were incurred with regard to our property, plant and equipment for the years ended October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nWe monitor relevant circumstances, including industry trends, general economic conditions, and the potential impact that such circumstances might have on the valuation of our identifiable intangibles. Events and changes in circumstances that may cause a triggering event and necessitate such a review include, but are not limited to: a decrease in sales for certain customers, improvements or changes in technology, and/or a decision to phase-out a trademark or trade name. Such events could negatively impact the carrying value of our identifiable intangibles. It is possible that changes in such circumstances or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions, and estimates made by us in assessing the appropriate valuation of our identifiable intangibles could require us to further write down a portion of our identifiable intangibles and record related non-cash impairment charges in the future. We apply a variety of techniques to establish the carrying value of our intangible assets, including the relief from royalty and excess current year earnings methods.\nDuring October 2016 and continuing throughout 2017, we determined that a triggering event occurred which necessitated a review of our long-term assets as prescribed above (expected reduction in volume for our United States vinyl business and results below our forecasts for Woodcraft). Based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis, we determined that our property, plant and equipment and defined-lived intangible assets were not impaired. However, with regard to our United States vinyl business, we recorded a change in accounting estimate associated with shortening the remaining useful lives of certain property, plant and equipment to be retired as part of the announced closures of several plants. We recognized incremental depreciation expense of $4.4 million in 2017 as a result of the change in estimates. In addition, we shortened the life of several defined-lived intangible assets, which resulted in the recognition of incremental amortization expense of $1.9 million for the year ended October 31, 2017.\nGoodwill\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, we review various qualitative factors to determine whether we believe there are indicators of impairment associated with goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets. If no impairment is indicated, no additional testing is required. Otherwise, we perform a goodwill impairment test annually as of August 31, or more often if there are indicators of impairment due to changes in circumstances or the occurrence of certain events. The test for impairment of goodwill requires a two-step approach as prescribed in ASC Topic 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d (ASC 350). The first step of the impairment test is to compare the carrying value of each reportable unit, including goodwill, to the fair value as determined using various valuation methods or a weighting of several such methods. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further testing is required and there is no impairment charge. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, a second step of the goodwill impairment test is required, whereby we compare the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination under which the consideration paid equals the calculated fair value of the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill for the particular reporting unit. We use the present value of future cash flows, discounted at our weighted average cost of capital, to determine fair value in combination with the market approach. Future cash flows are projected based upon our long-term forecasts by reportable unit and an estimated residual value. Our judgment is required in the estimation of future operating results and in determining the appropriate residual values of our reportable units. The residual values are determined by reference to an exchange transaction in an existing market for similar assets. Future operating results and residual values could reasonably differ from our estimates and a provision for impairment may be required in a future period depending upon such a change in circumstances or the occurrence of future events.\nAs of our annual testing date, August 31, 2017, we had five reporting units with goodwill balances: two reporting units included in our NA Engineered Components operating segment, two reporting units included in our EU Engineered Components operating segment, and one reporting unit included in our NA Cabinet Components operating segment. For the reporting units in our NA Engineered Components and our EU Engineered Components operating segments, we performed a qualitative assessment and determined that there were no indicators of impairment. Therefore, no additional goodwill impairment testing was deemed necessary for those units. For the reporting unit included in our NA Cabinet Components operating segment, we performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test at July 31, 2017, as actual results for this unit were below forecasts, a potential indicator of impairment. We determined the fair value of this reportable unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 6%. The test included the contribution of the two plants transferred from NA Engineered Components during 2017. At August 31, 2017, additional qualitative factors were considered and the step-one analysis was updated. The determined fair value of this reportable unit continued to exceed the carrying value by 5%.\nRestructuring\nWe account for restructuring costs in accordance with U.S. GAAP, whereby we accrue for one-time severance benefits pursuant to an approved plan of restructuring at the communication date, when affected employees have been notified of the potential severance and sufficient information has been provided for the employee to calculate severance benefits, in the event the employee is involuntarily terminated. In addition, we accrue costs associated with the termination of contractual commitments including operating leases at the time the lease is terminated pursuant to the lease provisions or in accordance with another agreement with the landlord. Otherwise, we continue to recognize operating lease expense through the cease-use date. After the cease-use date, we determine if our operating lease payments are at market. We assume sublet of the facility at the market rate. To the extent our lease obligations exceed the fair value rentals, we discount to arrive at the present value and record a liability. If the facility is not sublet, we expense the amount of the sublet in the current period until sublet. For other costs directly related to the restructuring effort, such as equipment moving costs, we expense in the period incurred.\nIn October 2016, we announced the closure of three operating plants, two related to our United States vinyl operations, and one related to our kitchen and bathroom cabinet door business in Mexico. We expensed $0.5 million pursuant to these restructuring efforts as of October 31, 2016, including an accrual for one-time severance cost of $0.4 million included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Our facility lease obligations were deemed to be at fair market value. In 2017, we incurred costs related to these plant closures including equipment moving costs, additional employee termination and severance costs, retirements and inventory adjustments, operating lease costs, accelerated amortization and depreciation costs, and equipment lease termination costs. In addition, we incurred costs related to the closure of a kitchen and bathroom cabinet door plant in Lansing, Kansas. Restructuring costs totaled $4.6 million for the year ended October 31, 2017. We continue to incur operating lease costs associated with the vinyl extrusion plants, and the Lansing, Kansas plant as we have not yet negotiated exit from these lease obligations.\nIncome Taxes\nWe operate in various jurisdictions and therefore our income tax expense relates to income taxes in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany, as well as local and state income taxes. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates in the period of the change. We record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets, as well as net operating losses and tax credit carry forward. We evaluate the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets and determine if our business will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets. We perform this review for recoverability on a jurisdictional basis, whereby we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence can be objectively verified. We evaluate recoverability based on an estimate of future taxable income using the long-term forecasts we use to evaluate long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets for impairment, taking into consideration the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and reviewing our current financial operations. In the event that our estimates and assumptions indicate we will not generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets, we will record a valuation allowance, to the extent indicated, to reduce our deferred tax assets to their realizable value.\nAnnually, we evaluate our tax positions to determine if there have been any changes in uncertain tax positions or if there has been a lapse in the statute of limitations with regards to such positions. During 2015, we reassessed and recognized our uncertain tax position with regard to our spin-off from our former parent in 2008, as a result of a no change letter received from the Internal Revenue Service in conjunction with an audit of our tax filings for the years ended October 31, 2012 and 2011. This recognition reduced the liability for uncertain tax positions by $4.1 million. Our liability for uncertain tax positions at October 31, 2017 and 2016 totaled $0.6 million and related to certain state tax items regarding the interpretation of tax laws and regulations.\nWe believe we will have sufficient taxable income in the future to fully utilize our unreserved deferred tax assets recorded as of October 31, 2017. There is a risk that our estimates related to the future use of loss carry forwards and our ability to realize our deferred tax assets may not come to fruition, and that the results could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. We have recorded the benefit associated with the patent box\u201d deduction in the United Kingdom with regard to our operations at HLP. We believe that it is more likely than not that our deduction with regard to this position would be sustained upon examination. In addition, we recorded the effect of a statutory change in the deferred tax rate from 19% to 17% in the United Kingdom in 2017 results, which provided a discrete tax benefit of $1.0 million during the period. Our deferred tax assets at October 31, 2017 and 2016 totaled $28.0 million and $35.3 million, respectively, against which we had recorded a valuation allowance of $1.3 million and $1.3 million, respectively.\nInsurance\nWe manage our costs of workers' compensation, group medical, property, casualty and other liability exposures through a combination of self-insurance retentions and insurance coverage with third-party carriers. Liabilities associated with our portion of this exposure are not discounted. We estimate our exposure by considering various factors which may include: (1) historical claims experience, (2) severity factors, (3) estimated claims incurred but not reported and (4) loss development factors, which are used to estimate how claims will develop over time until settled or closed. While we consider a number of factors in preparing our estimate of risk exposure, we must use our judgment to determine the amounts to accrue in our financial statements. Actual claims can differ significantly from estimated liabilities if future claims experience differs from historical experience, and if we determine that our assumptions used for analysis or our development factors are flawed. We do not recognize insurance recoveries until any contingencies relating to the claim have been resolved.\nInventory\nWe record inventory at the lower of cost or market value. Inventories are valued using the first-in first-out (FIFO) and last-in first-out (LIFO) methods. We use the dollar-value link chain LIFO method, and the LIFO reserve is calculated on a consolidated basis in a single consolidated pool. We recorded a benefit associated with the change in the LIFO reserve of approximately $0.3 million for the year ended October 31, 2016 and less than $0.1 million for the year ended October 31, 2015. We did not record a LIFO reserve adjustment for the year ended October 31, 2017. When we integrate acquisitions into our business we may value inventory utilizing either the LIFO or FIFO basis. Fixed costs related to excess manufacturing capacity have been expensed in the period, and therefore, are not capitalized into inventory. Inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded primarily based on our forecast of future demand and market conditions. Significant unanticipated changes to our forecasts or changes in the net realizable value of our inventory would require a change in the provision for excess or obsolete inventory. For the years ended October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our inventory reserves excluding the LIFO reserve, are approximately 5%, 6%, and 10% of gross inventory, respectively. Assuming an increase in obsolescence equal to 1% of gross inventory, net income would have been reduced by $0.7 million for the year ended October 31, 2017, net loss from continuing operations would have been increased by $0.3 million in 2016, and net income would have been reduced by $0.5 million for the year ended October 31, 2015.\nRetirement Plans\nWe sponsor a defined benefit pension plan and an unfunded postretirement plan that provides health care and life insurance benefits for a limited pool of eligible retirees and dependents. The measurement of liabilities related to these plans is based on our assumptions related to future events, including expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increases, and healthcare cost trend rates. The discount rate reflects the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled on the measurement date. We determine our discount rate using a RATE: Link Model whereby target yields are developed from bonds across a range of maturity points, and a curve is fitted to those targets. Spot rates (zero coupon bond yields) are developed from the curve and used to discount benefit payments associated with each future year. This model assumes spot rates will remain level beyond the 30-year point. We determine the present value of plan benefits by applying the discount rates to projected benefit cash flows. Actual pension plan asset investment performance, as well as other economic experience such as discount rate and demographic experience, will either reduce or increase unamortized pension losses at the end of any fiscal year, which ultimately affects future pension costs.\nThe effects of the decrease in selected assumptions, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for the pension plans in fiscal 2017, is shown below: Table 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase in Projected Benefit Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase in Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in Assumptions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease in discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>699\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease in expected long-term rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of October 31, 2017, our projected benefit obligation (PBO) and accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by $4.0 million and $3.1 million, respectively. As a comparison, our PBO and ABO exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $7.7 million and $6.5 million, respectively, as of October 31, 2016. During fiscal 2017, we contributed $3.6 million to the pension plan to continue to target a 100% funding threshold and to meet minimum contribution requirements. We expect to continue to fund at this level for fiscal 2018. Expected contributions are dependent on many variables, including the variability of the market value of the assets as compared to the obligation and other market or regulatory conditions. In addition, we take into consideration our business investment opportunities and our cash requirements. Accordingly, actual funding may differ greatly from current estimates.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, we are not required to immediately recognize the effects of a deviation between actual and assumed experience under our pension plan, or to revise our estimate as a result. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and disclosed as an unrecognized gain or loss. As of October 31, 2017 and 2016, a net actuarial loss of $5.2 million and $8.7 million, respectively, was included in our accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). There were no net prior service costs or transition obligations for the years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016. The effect on fiscal years after 2017 will depend on the actual experience of the plans.\nMortality assumptions used to determine the obligations for our pension plans are based on the RP-2006 base mortality table with MP-2017 mortality improvement scale.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have issued stock-based compensation in the form of stock options to directors, employees and officers, and non-vested restricted stock awards to certain key employees and officers. We apply the provisions of ASC Topic 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d (ASC 718), to determine the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model. We recognize the fair value as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on awards ultimately expected to vest. Stock options granted to directors vest immediately while the stock options granted to our employees and officers typically vest ratably over a three-year period with service and continued employment as the vesting conditions. For new option grants to retirement-eligible employees, we recognize expense and vest immediately upon grant, consistent with the retirement vesting acceleration provisions of these grants. For employees near retirement age, we amortize such grants over the period from the grant date to the retirement-eligibility date if such period is shorter than the standard vesting schedule. For grants of non-vested restricted stock, we calculate the compensation expense at the grant date as the number of shares granted multiplied by the closing stock price of our common stock on the date of grant. This expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. Our non-vested restricted stock grants to officers and employees cliff vest over a three-year period with service and continued employment as the only vesting criteria. Our fair value determination of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior over the expected term, our dividend rate, risk-free rate and expectation with regards to forfeitures. Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable. Because our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options, and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value, the valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of our employee stock options. Accordingly, that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer/willing seller market transaction.\nWe have granted other awards which are linked to the performance of our common stock, but will settle in cash rather than the issuance of shares of our common stock. The value of these awards fluctuates with changes in our stock price, with the resulting gains or losses reflected in the period of the change. We have recorded current and non-current liabilities related to these awards reflected in our consolidated balance sheets at October 31, 2017 and 2016, included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, we have granted performance share awards which settle in cash and shares. These awards have vesting criteria based on a market condition (relative total shareholder return) and an internal performance condition (earnings per share growth). We utilize a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the market condition and our stock price on the date of grant to value the internal performance condition. We bifurcate the liability and equity portion of the awards (amounts expected to settle in cash and shares, respectively) and recognize expense ratably over the vesting period of three years. We estimate that the performance measures will be met and shares will vest at target until the year of settlement (third year of cliff vesting). For the year ended October 31, 2017, we expect 50,676 shares to vest, of which 25,338 will be settled in shares and 25,338 will be settled in cash.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), which provides guidance as to when changes in share-based payment awards under Topic 718 should be accounted for as a modification of the award. Essentially, the changes should be considered a modification unless specific criteria are met. This guidance becomes effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. We will adopt this guidance in Fiscal 2019. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715), Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. This update provides explicit guidance on how to present the service cost component and other components of net benefit cost in the income statement and allows only the service cost component of net benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We anticipate adopting ASU 2017-07 in fiscal 2019 and are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). This guidance simplifies the current two-step goodwill impairment test by eliminating the second step. Essentially, the entity would compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The resulting loss would be limited to the amount of goodwill. This guidance also eliminates the requirement for a reporting unit with zero or negative carrying value to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill and apply step-two of the goodwill impairment test if the qualitative assessment fails. Thus, the same impairment assessment will be applied to all reporting\nunits (even if the carrying value is zero or negative). This guidance should be applied prospectively and becomes effective for public entities for the annual period, and interim periods within that year, beginning after December 15, 2019. We will adopt this guidance in Fiscal 2021. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805), which provides clarity when determining whether a set of assets and activities constitutes a business. Specifically, if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not deemed to be a business. This guidance becomes effective for public entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We will adopt this guidance in Fiscal 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This amendment is intended to reduce diversity in practice as to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows by providing guidance for several specific cash flow issues. This guidance becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and, therefore, we will adopt this pronouncement in fiscal 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). This amendment replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP and requires that financial assets be measured on an amortized cost basis and presented at the net amount expected to be collected. This new methodology reflects expected credit losses (rather than probable credit losses) and requires consideration of a broader range of supportable information when determining these estimated credit losses, including relevant experience, current conditions and supportable forecasts to determine collectability. In addition, the amendment provides guidance with regard to the use of an allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets and available-for-sale debt securities. This amendment becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that fiscal year. We expect to adopt this amendment during fiscal 2021, with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This amendment simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This guidance becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and, therefore, we will adopt this pronouncement in fiscal 2018. We do not expect this pronouncement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification. These amendments replace current guidance and require the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous U.S. GAAP. The amendments apply to any entity that enters into leasing arrangements. This guidance becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and, therefore, we will adopt this pronouncement in fiscal 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. This amendment simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by replacing the lower of cost or market revaluation method with the lower of cost and net realizable value test. This guidance is applicable to all inventories measured using methods other than last-in first-out method and the retail inventory method. This guidance becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We expect to adopt this pronouncement in fiscal 2018, with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This guidance prescribes a methodology to determine when revenue is recognizable and constitutes a principles-based approach to revenue recognition based on the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for goods or services. In addition, this guidance requires additional disclosure in the notes to the financial statements with regard to the methodology applied. This pronouncement will essentially supersede and replace existing revenue recognition rules in U.S. GAAP, including industry-specific guidance. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 to defer implementation of this guidance to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. ASU 2014-09 has been further amended by the following items, which we intend to implement concurrently during fiscal 2019:\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on our current assumptions, expectations, estimates and projections about our business and the homebuilding industry, and therefore, it should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, as well as \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" discussed elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a listing of potential risks and uncertainties which impact our business and industry, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Actual results could differ from our expectations due to several factors which include, but are not limited to: market price and demand for our products, economic and competitive conditions, capital expenditures, new technology, regulatory changes and other uncertainties. Unless otherwise required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.\nOur Business\nWe manufacture components for original equipment manufacturers in the building products industry. These components can be categorized as window and door (fenestration) components and kitchen and bath cabinet components. Examples of fenestration components include (1) energy-efficient flexible insulating glass spacers, (2) extruded vinyl profiles, (3) window and door screens, and (4) precision-formed metal and wood products. In addition, we provide certain other non-fenestration components and products, which include solar panel sealants, trim moldings, vinyl decking, fencing, water retention barriers, and conservatory roof components. We use low-cost production processes and engineering expertise to provide our customers with specialized products for their specific window, door, and cabinet applications. We believe these capabilities provide us with unique competitive advantages. We serve a primary customer base in North America and the United Kingdom, and also serve customers in international markets through our operating plants in the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as through sales and marketing efforts in other countries.\nWe continue to invest in organic growth initiatives and have completed several targeted business acquisitions in recent years. We intend to continue to pursue business acquisitions that allow us to expand our existing fenestration and cabinet component footprint, enhance our product offerings, provide new complementary technology, enhance our leadership position within the markets we serve, and expand into new markets or service lines. We have disposed of non-core businesses in the past, and continue to evaluate our business portfolio to ensure that we are investing in markets where we believe there is potential future growth.\nWe currently have three reportable business segments: (1) North American Engineered Components segment ( NA Engineered Components\u201d), comprised of four operating segments primarily focused on the fenestration market in North America manufacturing vinyl profiles, IG spacers, screens & other fenestration components; (2) European Engineered Components segment ( EU Engineered Components\u201d), comprised of our United Kingdom-based vinyl extrusion business, manufacturing vinyl profiles and conservatories, and the European insulating glass business manufacturing IG spacers; and (3) North American Cabinet Components segment ( NA Cabinet Components\u201d), comprised of the North American cabinet door and components business acquired in November 2015, and two wood-manufacturing plants that were transferred from the NA Engineered Components segment during 2017 in order to better align our wood-related products under a common management team. The results of operations and net assets associated with the plant moves is reflected for all applicable periods presented in the accompanying discussion of Results of Operations\u201d and is further described at Note 18, \"Segment Information\", in the accompanying financial statements. We maintain a grouping called Unallocated Corporate & Other, which includes transaction expenses, stock-based compensation, long-term incentive awards based on performance of our common stock and other factors, certain severance and legal costs not allocable to our operating segments, depreciation of corporate assets, interest expense, other, net, income taxes and inter-segment eliminations. Other corporate general and administrative costs have been allocated to the reportable business segments, based upon a relative measure of profitability in order to more accurately reflect each reportable business segment's administrative costs. We allocate corporate expenses to businesses acquired mid-year from the date of acquisition. No change in historical corporate expense allocation has been made to reflect the plant moves noted above as the impact would not have been significant. The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those used to prepare our accompanying consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes corporate general and administrative expense allocated during the years ended October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\nNotable Items\nIn an effort to focus on protecting margins and improving cash flows, we previously announced a strategy to stop manufacturing $65.0 million to $85.0 million of business, thereby reducing our sales volume with certain low-margin customers. During 2017, we have rationalized capacity and closed two United States vinyl plants and two cabinet door plants, relocating assets to improve overall operational efficiency. We have incurred $4.6 million of expense associated with these restructuring efforts during fiscal 2017, and have recognized $6.2 million of accelerated depreciation and amortization associated with related assets.\nOn October 31, 2017, we sold our interest in the net assets of a wood-flooring business to a private equity investor for $0.6 million in cash, and a long-term receivable totaling $1.2 million (payable over a five-year term). We recorded a loss on the transaction of $1.8 million, including deal costs. The transaction is subject to a working capital adjustment.\nOn February 20, 2017, we entered into a $16.6 million capital lease arrangement with a related party to purchase a new manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom, as further described in Note 8, \"Debt and Capital Lease Obligations,\" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein.\nOn November 2, 2015, we acquired Woodcraft, a manufacturer of cabinet doors and other components to OEMs in the kitchen and bathroom cabinet industry. We paid $245.9 million in cash, resulting in goodwill totaling $113.7 million. For additional details of this acquisition, see Note 2, \"Acquisitions and Dispositions,\" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein.\nOn June 15, 2015, we acquired HLP, an extruder of vinyl lineal products and manufacturer of other plastic products incorporated and registered in England and Wales, for $131.7 million in cash, net of cash acquired, $7.7 million of debt assumed and contingent consideration of $10.3 million, resulting in goodwill of approximately $61.3 million. The agreement contains an earn-out provision which is calculated as a percentage of earnings before interest, tax and depreciation and amortization for a specified period, as defined in the purchase agreement. Pursuant to this earn-out provision, the former owner selected the twelve-month period ended July 31, 2016 as the measurement period for the earn-out calculation. On November 7, 2016, we paid $8.5 million pursuant to this earn-out agreement, as further described in Note 2, \"Acquisitions and Dispositions,\" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein.\nMarket Overview and Outlook\nWe believe the primary drivers of our operating results continue to be North American new home construction and residential remodeling and replacement (R&R) activity. We believe that housing starts and window shipments are indicators of activity levels in the homebuilding and window industries, and we use this data, as published by or derived from third-party sources, to evaluate the market. We have historically evaluated the market using data from the National Association of Homebuilders (NAHB) with regard to housing starts, and published reports by Ducker Worldwide, LLC (Ducker), a consulting and research firm, with regard to window shipments. These sources generally provide information about activity levels in the United States.\nHousing starts and window shipments in the United States have increased in recent years. The NAHB has forecasted calendar-year housing starts (excluding manufactured units) at1.2 million units in 2016 and 2017; increasing to 1.3 million units in 2018, reflecting increasing consumer confidence and a healthier economy. Ducker indicated that window shipments in the R&R market are expected to increase to 27.6 million units in 2016, 28.1 million units in 2017, 28.8 million units in 2018 and 29.3 million units in 2019, and new construction window shipments are forecasted to increase at a higher pace. Derived from reports published by Ducker, the overall growth in window shipments for the trailing twelve-month period ended September 30, 2017 was 2.9%. During this period, growth in new construction increased 5.2%, while growth in R&R activity increased 1.2%. Growth in new construction continues to outpace the growth in R&R, with a greater portion of the new construction growth associated with multi-family housing.\nOur HLP business is largely focused on the sale of vinyl house systems under the trade name Liniar\u201d to smaller window manufacturers in the United Kingdom. HLP is one of the larger providers of vinyl extruded product in the United Kingdom in terms of volume shipped. Similar to our domestic business, management evaluates the fenestration market in the United Kingdom using published reports by D&G Consulting, a consulting and research firm, with regard to forecasts of housing starts in the public and private sectors and window shipments. Currently, the United Kingdom is experiencing a shortage in affordable housing, with rising demand due in part to a growing immigrant population. HLP's current primary customers are smaller window fabricators, as opposed to the larger OEMs that comprise a large portion of the North American market. These manufacturers seek the quality and technology of the specific products identified by the Liniar trade name. In addition, HLP services non-fenestration markets including the manufacture of roofing for conservatories, vinyl decking and vinyl water retention barriers used for landscaping. We believe there are growth opportunities within these markets in the United Kingdom and potential synergies which may enable us to sell complementary products.\nWoodcraft manufactures kitchen and bathroom cabinet doors and components, amongst other products, using a variety of woods from traditional hardwoods to engineered wood products. Currently, Woodcraft sells all of its products in the United States, so domestic housing starts and R&R activity constitute the primary drivers of this business as well. We also utilize industry publications to evaluate the wood markets and commodity trends. Although NAHB forecasts indicate expected continued growth in the United States housing market, much of this anticipated growth is in new construction for multi-family dwellings, or rental properties, which is not the primary market for Woodcraft's products. In recent years, forecasts project increased growth in single family homes. The cabinet door market is stratified as follows: stock (low-cost, low-variations), semi-custom (more customized, just-in-time manufacturing, higher price point) and custom (precise customer specifications, just-in-time manufacturing, high-end price point). Woodcraft's primary market is semi-custom.\nOur business is seasonal, particularly our fenestration business, as inclement weather during the winter months tends to slow down construction, particularly as related to outside of the house\u201d construction. To some extent, we believe our kitchen and bathroom cabinet door business lessens the impact of seasonality on our operating results, as the cabinet business is inside of the house\u201d and less susceptible to weather. However, significant weather events do disrupt the construction industry. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma impacted the Southern United States during August and September of 2017. Although our operating plants were not directly impacted, several of our customers were impacted directly, as well as indirectly, as some skilled laborers relocated to the region for construction jobs. From a longer-term perspective, the rebuilding efforts from these storms may spur additional growth in construction during fiscal 2018 and beyond.\nWe are impacted by regulation of energy standards. Although the United States government has been less aggressively pursuing higher energy efficiency standards in recent years, other countries have implemented higher energy efficiency standards which should bode well for our fenestration-related business in these markets, particularly our warm-edge spacer products.\nWe utilize several commodities in our business for which pricing can fluctuate, including polyvinyl resin (PVC), petroleum products, aluminum, TIO2, silicone and wood. For the majority of our customers and critical suppliers, we have price adjusters in place which effectively share the base pass-through price changes for these commodities with our customers commensurate with the market at large. Our long-term exposure to these price fluctuations is somewhat mitigated due to the contractual component of the adjuster program. However, these adjusters are not in place with all customers, and there is a level of exposure to such volatility due to the lag associated with the timing of price updates in accordance with our customer agreements.\nIn July 2016, the United Kingdom voted to exit the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit\u201d), which has impacted the valuation of the British Pound Sterling relative to other currencies used in our business, including our reporting currency, the United States Dollar. Although the British Pound Sterling relative to the United States Dollar appears to have stabilized during fiscal 2017, the Pound remains well below the pre-Brexit level, and some general market uncertainty remains in the United Kingdom. Although we do not know the long-term effects of this change, there has been some impact on our results of operations to date (primarily foreign currency translation).\nThe global economy remains uncertain due to currency devaluations, political unrest, terror threats, and even the political landscape in the United States. These and other macro-economic factors have impacted the global financial markets, which may have contributed to significant changes in foreign currencies. We continue to monitor our exposure to changes in exchange rates.\nWe remain optimistic about our growth prospects in the near-term and believe our restructuring efforts in fiscal 2017 will enhance our financial performance and cash flow generation in fiscal 2018 and beyond.\nComparison of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016\nThis table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the twelve-month periods ended October 31, 2017 and 2016.\n\nOur operating results for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 and 2016 include the contributions of Woodcraft acquired on November 2, 2015. Our year-over-year results by reportable segment follow.\nChanges Related to Operating Income by Reportable Segment:\nNA Engineered Components \nNet Sales. Net sales decreased $63.4 million, or 12%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced a $66.4 million decrease in sales attributable to volume, an increase of $5.4 million related to surcharges for commodities used in our business, primarily resin and aluminum, and a decrease of $2.4 million attributable to price. The significant decrease in volume was anticipated with regard to our previously-announced plan to shed low-margin business associated with our United States vinyl business, although the transition of this volume to other suppliers was at a quicker pace than originally expected. In addition, $2.4 million of the decrease was associated with poor performance of our wood-flooring business which was sold on October 31, 2017. The overall decrease in volume is significantly offset by a corresponding decrease in cost of goods sold including purchases of raw materials used in our manufacturing process and labor, thereby mitigating some of the negative impact on our operating margins. We continue to align our cost structure to counter the effects of the anticipated volume reduction.\nCost of Sales. The cost of sales decreased $41.4 million, or 10%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. This decrease correlates with a 12% decrease in revenues for the respective period. Overall material and labor costs decreased year-over-year, directly related to the lower sales volume, and cost saving measures to align the labor force in light of the decreased volume. In addition, freight and repair and maintenance costs declined, and fixed cost savings were realized due to restructuring efforts in 2017. Consolidated gross margin for the segment declined year-over-year primarily due to\nthe mix of products produced and sold during 2017 compared to 2016, particularly at our United States vinyl operations, and lower volume of solar edge tape sales for our insulating glass business.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $9.2 million, or 15%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Of this decrease, $1.2 million represents a decline in the amount of corporate costs allocated to the segment year-over-year, reflecting an overall decline in such corporate office costs. The remainder of the difference is primarily associated with lower headcount following restructuring efforts at our United States vinyl operations, lower incentive accruals based on financial performance, and lower professional fees. Partially offsetting these declines in expense is a loss on the sale of our wood-flooring business of $1.8 million in October 2017, and normal salary and employee benefit costs inflation.\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges of $3.6 million represent equipment and inventory moving costs incurred in conjunction with the announced closure of two vinyl extrusion plants in the United States, and other related costs including facility lease expense, severance and employee benefit costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $4.5 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to a change in estimate regarding the remaining service lives for assets associated with the restructuring efforts noted above, resulting in incremental depreciation of $3.2 million, and a change in estimate related to certain intangible assets resulting in incremental amortization of $1.6 million. Incremental depreciation expense associated with property, plant and equipment placed in service during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, was more than offset by the run-off of depreciation expense associated with existing assets and disposals during this period.\nAsset Impairment Charges. We recorded an asset impairment charge of $12.6 million in 2016 which represents the write-off of the remaining goodwill asset associated with our United States vinyl extrusion business. We did not incur an asset impairment charge during 2017.\nEU Engineered Components \nNet Sales. Net sales decreased $2.2 million, or 1%, when comparing the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 to the same period in 2016. This decrease is entirely attributable to a $10.7 million negative impact associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, revenue increased $8.5 million, of which $8.6 million related to volume, partially offset by a slight decrease in price of $0.1 million. The volume improvement reflects favorable market growth despite the intentional shed of some lower margin customers at HLP.\nCost of Sales. The cost of sales increased $0.4 million, year-over-year compared to a decrease in revenue for these periods. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate changes as noted above, the increase in cost of goods sold reflects higher material costs, due in part to volume, but also due to higher cost of commodities such as resin and silicone. In addition, margins were impacted during 2017 at HLP due to some inefficiencies caused by delays transitioning to the new warehouse.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expense decreased $2.6 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease reflects a $0.4 million decline in costs allocated from corporate in 2017, as well as lower selling and marketing costs, lower incentive accruals based on earnings, and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.5 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily attributable to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes as well as the timing of new property, plant and equipment placed in service during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, less the run-off of depreciation expense associated with existing assets and disposals during the period.\nNA Cabinet Components\n\nNet Sales. Net sales increased $0.7 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced a $0.7 million increase in sales attributable to higher volume, an increase of $2.4 million in revenues associated with pricing, offset by a $2.4 million decrease in revenue associated with lower wood surcharges. The increase in volume reflects market growth of approximately 5%, some new customers, higher-than-expected spot sales, and incremental volume of $1.1 million associated with the two plants transferred from the NA Engineered Components segments. These volume increases are partially offset by volume lost as a result of restructuring efforts that included the closure of a plant in Mexico in October 2016 and a plant in Kansas in September 2017, as well as the previously-announced plan to shed less profitable business. The decrease in revenue associated with wood surcharges represents the change in the price of wood used in our business and the timing lag associated with our contractual ability to pass this cost to our customers.\nCost of Sales. The cost of sales remained consistent at $213.3 million for the years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016. However, the results for 2016 include a charge of $2.3 million related to purchase accounting (step-up and turn of inventory acquired) which did not occur in 2017. Excluding this item, cost of sales increased $2.3 million, or 1%, year-over-year. Margins in 2017 reflect a more favorable product mix, but were negatively impacted by some labor inefficiency, higher health insurance and benefit costs, less favorable material pricing and inventory adjustments and reserves. Overall, cost of sales reflects changes in sales volume and product mix.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expense increased $0.8 million, or 5%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, despite a $0.5 million decrease in allocated corporate costs during this period. The overall $1.3 million increase reflects some additional administrative headcount, normal wage inflation, and higher medical insurance and employee benefit costs year-over-year.\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges of $0.9 million represent equipment moving and other related costs associated with the Mexican plant closure effected in October 2016 and a Kansas plant closure effected in September 2017.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.4 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Of this increase, $0.2 million was associated with accelerated depreciation of assets at the Kansas plant, closed in September 2017. The incremental depreciation and amortization expense associated with property, plant and equipment placed into service during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, slightly exceeded the run-off of depreciation expense associated with existing assets and disposals during this period.\nUnallocated Corporate & Other \nNet Sales. Net sales for Unallocated Corporate & Other represents the elimination of inter-segment sales for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 and 2016. The change between periods reflects the amount of inter-segment sales (primarily\nbetween NA Engineered Components and EU Engineered Components related to a change in the terms of a royalty agreement in 2017).\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales for Corporate & Other consists of the elimination of inter-segment profit in inventory and changes in the LIFO reserve adjustments and other costs. The change for the twelve-month periods ended October 31, 2017 and 2016 of $2.6 million was primarily related to the elimination of inter-segment sales and a decrease in the LIFO reserve of $0.3 million in 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $5.9 million, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, despite a $2.1 million decrease in the amount of corporate expense allocated to the operating segments in 2017 compared to 2016. Therefore, the overall decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is $8.0 million. Of this amount, a net decrease of $4.7 million relates to transaction costs, as the prior year included $5.2 million associated with the Woodcraft acquisition. The remainder of the difference relates primarily to lower professional fees as we received $4.0 million of insurance reimbursement in 2017 for legal fees incurred defending an alleged product defect claim. We also recorded lower incentive accruals based on financial performance. These decreases were partially offset by normal wage inflation and higher medical insurance and benefit costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.1 million, or 17%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, reflecting the run-off of depreciation during 2016 primarily related to computer software, hardware and licensing. Relatively few new assets were placed in service at corporate during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017.\nChanges related to Non-Operating Items:\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $26.9 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Of this amount, $16.7 million was attributable to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, original issuer's discount", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on our current assumptions, expectations, estimates and projections about our business and the homebuilding industry, and therefore, it should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, as well as \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" discussed elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a listing of potential risks and uncertainties which impact our business and industry, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Actual results could differ from our expectations due to several factors which include, but are not limited to: market price and demand for our products, economic and competitive conditions, capital expenditures, new technology, regulatory changes and other uncertainties. Unless otherwise required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.\nOur Business\nWe manufacture components for original equipment manufacturers in the building products industry. These components can be categorized as window and door (fenestration) components and kitchen and bath cabinet components. Examples of fenestration components include (1) energy-efficient flexible insulating glass spacers, (2) extruded vinyl profiles, (3) window and door screens, and (4) precision-formed metal and wood products. In addition, we provide certain other non-fenestration components and products, which include solar panel sealants, trim moldings, vinyl decking, fencing, water retention barriers, and conservatory roof components. We use low-cost production processes and engineering expertise to provide our customers with specialized products for their specific window, door, and cabinet applications. We believe these capabilities provide us with unique competitive advantages. We serve a primary customer base in North America and the United Kingdom, and also serve customers in international markets through our operating plants in the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as through sales and marketing efforts in other countries.\nWe continue to invest in organic growth initiatives and have completed several targeted business acquisitions in recent years. We intend to continue to pursue business acquisitions that allow us to expand our existing fenestration and cabinet component footprint, enhance our product offerings, provide new complementary technology, enhance our leadership position within the markets we serve, and expand into new markets or service lines. We have disposed of non-core businesses in the past, and continue to evaluate our business portfolio to ensure that we are investing in markets where we believe there is potential future growth.\nWe currently have three reportable business segments: (1) North American Engineered Components segment ( NA Engineered Components\u201d), comprised of four operating segments primarily focused on the fenestration market in North America manufacturing vinyl profiles, IG spacers, screens & other fenestration components; (2) European Engineered Components segment ( EU Engineered Components\u201d), comprised of our United Kingdom-based vinyl extrusion business, manufacturing vinyl profiles and conservatories, and the European insulating glass business manufacturing IG spacers; and (3) North American Cabinet Components segment ( NA Cabinet Components\u201d), comprised of the North American cabinet door and components business acquired in November 2015, and two wood-manufacturing plants that were transferred from the NA Engineered Components segment during 2017 in order to better align our wood-related products under a common management team. The results of operations and net assets associated with the plant moves is reflected for all applicable periods presented in the accompanying discussion of Results of Operations\u201d and is further described at Note 18, \"Segment Information\", in the accompanying financial statements. We maintain a grouping called Unallocated Corporate & Other, which includes transaction expenses, stock-based compensation, long-term incentive awards based on performance of our common stock and other factors, certain severance and legal costs not allocable to our operating segments, depreciation of corporate assets, interest expense, other, net, income taxes and inter-segment eliminations. Other corporate general and administrative costs have been allocated to the reportable business segments, based upon a relative measure of profitability in order to more accurately reflect each reportable business segment's administrative costs. We allocate corporate expenses to businesses acquired mid-year from the date of acquisition. No change in historical corporate expense allocation has been made to reflect the plant moves noted above as the impact would not have been significant. The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those used to prepare our accompanying consolidated financial statements.

During 2017, we have rationalized capacity and closed two United States vinyl plants and two cabinet door plants, relocating assets to improve overall operational efficiency. We have incurred $4.6 million of expense associated with these restructuring efforts during fiscal 2017, and have recognized $6.2 million of accelerated depreciation and amortization associated with related assets.\nOn October 31, 2017, we sold our interest in the net assets of a wood-flooring business to a private equity investor for $0.6 million in cash, and a long-term receivable totaling $1.2 million (payable over a five-year term). We recorded a loss on the transaction of $1.8 million, including deal costs. The transaction is subject to a working capital adjustment.\nOn February 20, 2017, we entered into a $16.6 million capital lease arrangement with a related party to purchase a new manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom, as further described in Note 8, \"Debt and Capital Lease Obligations,\" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein.\nOn November 2, 2015, we acquired Woodcraft, a manufacturer of cabinet doors and other components to OEMs in the kitchen and bathroom cabinet industry. We paid $245.9 million in cash, resulting in goodwill totaling $113.7 million. For additional details of this acquisition, see Note 2, \"Acquisitions and Dispositions,\" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein.\nOn June 15, 2015, we acquired HLP, an extruder of vinyl lineal products and manufacturer of other plastic products incorporated and registered in England and Wales, for $131.7 million in cash, net of cash acquired, $7.7 million of debt assumed and contingent consideration of $10.3 million, resulting in goodwill of approximately $61.3 million. The agreement contains an earn-out provision which is calculated as a percentage of earnings before interest, tax and depreciation and amortization for a specified period, as defined in the purchase agreement. Pursuant to this earn-out provision, the former owner selected the twelve-month period ended July 31, 2016 as the measurement period for the earn-out calculation. On November 7, 2016, we paid $8.5 million pursuant to this earn-out agreement, as further described in Note 2, \"Acquisitions and Dispositions,\" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein.\nMarket Overview and Outlook\nWe believe the primary drivers of our operating results continue to be North American new home construction and residential remodeling and replacement (R&R) activity. We believe that housing starts and window shipments are indicators of activity levels in the homebuilding and window industries, and we use this data, as published by or derived from third-party sources, to evaluate the market. We have historically evaluated the market using data from the National Association of Homebuilders (NAHB) with regard to housing starts, and published reports by Ducker Worldwide, LLC (Ducker), a consulting and research firm, with regard to window shipments. These sources generally provide information about activity levels in the United States.\nHousing starts and window shipments in the United States have increased in recent years. The NAHB has forecasted calendar-year housing starts (excluding manufactured units) at1.2 million units in 2016 and 2017; increasing to 1.3 million units in 2018, reflecting increasing consumer confidence and a healthier economy. Ducker indicated that window shipments in the R&R market are expected to increase to 27.6 million units in 2016, 28.1 million units in 2017, 28.8 million units in 2018 and 29.3 million units in 2019, and new construction window shipments are forecasted to increase at a higher pace. Derived from reports published by Ducker, the overall growth in window shipments for the trailing twelve-month period ended September 30, 2017 was 2.9%. During this period, growth in new construction increased 5.2%, while growth in R&R activity increased 1.2%. Growth in new construction continues to outpace the growth in R&R, with a greater portion of the new construction growth associated with multi-family housing.\nOur HLP business is largely focused on the sale of vinyl house systems under the trade name Liniar\u201d to smaller window manufacturers in the United Kingdom. HLP is one of the larger providers of vinyl extruded product in the United Kingdom in terms of volume shipped. Similar to our domestic business, management evaluates the fenestration market in the United Kingdom using published reports by D&G Consulting, a consulting and research firm, with regard to forecasts of housing starts in the public and private sectors and window shipments. Currently, the United Kingdom is experiencing a shortage in affordable housing, with rising demand due in part to a growing immigrant population. HLP's current primary customers are smaller window fabricators, as opposed to the larger OEMs that comprise a large portion of the North American market. These manufacturers seek the quality and technology of the specific products identified by the Liniar trade name. In addition, HLP services non-fenestration markets including the manufacture of roofing for conservatories, vinyl decking and vinyl water retention barriers used for landscaping. We believe there are growth opportunities within these markets in the United Kingdom and potential synergies which may enable us to sell complementary products.\nWoodcraft manufactures kitchen and bathroom cabinet doors and components, amongst other products, using a variety of woods from traditional hardwoods to engineered wood products. Currently, Woodcraft sells all of its products in the United States, so domestic housing starts and R&R activity constitute the primary drivers of this business as well. We also utilize industry publications to evaluate the wood markets and commodity trends. Although NAHB forecasts indicate expected continued growth in the United States housing market, much of this anticipated growth is in new construction for multi-family dwellings, or rental properties, which is not the primary market for Woodcraft's products. In recent years, forecasts project increased growth in single family homes. The cabinet door market is stratified as follows: stock (low-cost, low-variations), semi-custom (more customized, just-in-time manufacturing, higher price point) and custom (precise customer specifications, just-in-time manufacturing, high-end price point). Woodcraft's primary market is semi-custom.\nOur business is seasonal, particularly our fenestration business, as inclement weather during the winter months tends to slow down construction, particularly as related to outside of the house\u201d construction. To some extent, we believe our kitchen and bathroom cabinet door business lessens the impact of seasonality on our operating results, as the cabinet business is inside of the house\u201d and less susceptible to weather. However, significant weather events do disrupt the construction industry. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma impacted the Southern United States during August and September of 2017. Although our operating plants were not directly impacted, several of our customers were impacted directly, as well as indirectly, as some skilled laborers relocated to the region for construction jobs. From a longer-term perspective, the rebuilding efforts from these storms may spur additional growth in construction during fiscal 2018 and beyond.\nWe are impacted by regulation of energy standards. Although the United States government has been less aggressively pursuing higher energy efficiency standards in recent years, other countries have implemented higher energy efficiency standards which should bode well for our fenestration-related business in these markets, particularly our warm-edge spacer products.\nWe utilize several commodities in our business for which pricing can fluctuate, including polyvinyl resin (PVC), petroleum products, aluminum, TIO2, silicone and wood. For the majority of our customers and critical suppliers, we have price adjusters in place which effectively share the base pass-through price changes for these commodities with our customers commensurate with the market at large. Our long-term exposure to these price fluctuations is somewhat mitigated due to the contractual component of the adjuster program. However, these adjusters are not in place with all customers, and there is a level of exposure to such volatility due to the lag associated with the timing of price updates in accordance with our customer agreements.\nIn July 2016, the United Kingdom voted to exit the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit\u201d), which has impacted the valuation of the British Pound Sterling relative to other currencies used in our business, including our reporting currency, the United States Dollar. Although the British Pound Sterling relative to the United States Dollar appears to have stabilized during fiscal 2017, the Pound remains well below the pre-Brexit level, and some general market uncertainty remains in the United Kingdom. Although we do not know the long-term effects of this change, there has been some impact on our results of operations to date (primarily foreign currency translation).\nThe global economy remains uncertain due to currency devaluations, political unrest, terror threats, and even the political landscape in the United States. These and other macro-economic factors have impacted the global financial markets, which may have contributed to significant changes in foreign currencies. We continue to monitor our exposure to changes in exchange rates.\nWe remain optimistic about our growth prospects in the near-term and believe our restructuring efforts in fiscal 2017 will enhance our financial performance and cash flow generation in fiscal 2018 and beyond.\nComparison of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016\nThis table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the twelve-month periods ended October 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended October 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>866.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>928.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(61.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>672.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>710.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>98.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(800)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>57.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment charges\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>34.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(9.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (expense) benefit\n</td> <td>(6.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>284%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,084)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating results for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 and 2016 include the contributions of Woodcraft acquired on November 2, 2015.

Net sales decreased $63.4 million, or 12%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced a $66.4 million decrease in sales attributable to volume, an increase of $5.4 million related to surcharges for commodities used in our business, primarily resin and aluminum, and a decrease of $2.4 million attributable to price. The significant decrease in volume was anticipated with regard to our previously-announced plan to shed low-margin business associated with our United States vinyl business, although the transition of this volume to other suppliers was at a quicker pace than originally expected. In addition, $2.4 million of the decrease was associated with poor performance of our wood-flooring business which was sold on October 31, 2017. The overall decrease in volume is significantly offset by a corresponding decrease in cost of goods sold including purchases of raw materials used in our manufacturing process and labor, thereby mitigating some of the negative impact on our operating margins. We continue to align our cost structure to counter the effects of the anticipated volume reduction.\nCost of Sales. The cost of sales decreased $41.4 million, or 10%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. This decrease correlates with a 12% decrease in revenues for the respective period. Overall material and labor costs decreased year-over-year, directly related to the lower sales volume, and cost saving measures to align the labor force in light of the decreased volume. In addition, freight and repair and maintenance costs declined, and fixed cost savings were realized due to restructuring efforts in 2017. Consolidated gross margin for the segment declined year-over-year primarily due to\nthe mix of products produced and sold during 2017 compared to 2016, particularly at our United States vinyl operations, and lower volume of solar edge tape sales for our insulating glass business.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $9.2 million, or 15%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Of this decrease, $1.2 million represents a decline in the amount of corporate costs allocated to the segment year-over-year, reflecting an overall decline in such corporate office costs. The remainder of the difference is primarily associated with lower headcount following restructuring efforts at our United States vinyl operations, lower incentive accruals based on financial performance, and lower professional fees. Partially offsetting these declines in expense is a loss on the sale of our wood-flooring business of $1.8 million in October 2017, and normal salary and employee benefit costs inflation.\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges of $3.6 million represent equipment and inventory moving costs incurred in conjunction with the announced closure of two vinyl extrusion plants in the United States, and other related costs including facility lease expense, severance and employee benefit costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $4.5 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to a change in estimate regarding the remaining service lives for assets associated with the restructuring efforts noted above, resulting in incremental depreciation of $3.2 million, and a change in estimate related to certain intangible assets resulting in incremental amortization of $1.6 million. Incremental depreciation expense associated with property, plant and equipment placed in service during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, was more than offset by the run-off of depreciation expense associated with existing assets and disposals during this period.\nAsset Impairment Charges. We recorded an asset impairment charge of $12.6 million in 2016 which represents the write-off of the remaining goodwill asset associated with our United States vinyl extrusion business. We did not incur an asset impairment charge during 2017.\nEU Engineered Components Table 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended October 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>104.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>20.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income margin\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales. Net sales decreased $2.2 million, or 1%, when comparing the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 to the same period in 2016. This decrease is entirely attributable to a $10.7 million negative impact associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, revenue increased $8.5 million, of which $8.6 million related to volume, partially offset by a slight decrease in price of $0.1 million. The volume improvement reflects favorable market growth despite the intentional shed of some lower margin customers at HLP.\nCost of Sales. The cost of sales increased $0.4 million, year-over-year compared to a decrease in revenue for these periods. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate changes as noted above, the increase in cost of goods sold reflects higher material costs, due in part to volume, but also due to higher cost of commodities such as resin and silicone. In addition, margins were impacted during 2017 at HLP due to some inefficiencies caused by delays transitioning to the new warehouse.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expense decreased $2.6 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease reflects a $0.4 million decline in costs allocated from corporate in 2017, as well as lower selling and marketing costs, lower incentive accruals based on earnings, and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.5 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily attributable to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes as well as the timing of new property, plant and equipment placed in service during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, less the run-off of depreciation expense associated with existing assets and disposals during the period.\nNA Cabinet Components\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended October 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>248.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>248.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>213.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>213.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(800)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income margin\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales. Net sales increased $0.7 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced a $0.7 million increase in sales attributable to higher volume, an increase of $2.4 million in revenues associated with pricing, offset by a $2.4 million decrease in revenue associated with lower wood surcharges. The increase in volume reflects market growth of approximately 5%, some new customers, higher-than-expected spot sales, and incremental volume of $1.1 million associated with the two plants transferred from the NA Engineered Components segments. These volume increases are partially offset by volume lost as a result of restructuring efforts that included the closure of a plant in Mexico in October 2016 and a plant in Kansas in September 2017, as well as the previously-announced plan to shed less profitable business. The decrease in revenue associated with wood surcharges represents the change in the price of wood used in our business and the timing lag associated with our contractual ability to pass this cost to our customers.\nCost of Sales. The cost of sales remained consistent at $213.3 million for the years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016. However, the results for 2016 include a charge of $2.3 million related to purchase accounting (step-up and turn of inventory acquired) which did not occur in 2017. Excluding this item, cost of sales increased $2.3 million, or 1%, year-over-year. Margins in 2017 reflect a more favorable product mix, but were negatively impacted by some labor inefficiency, higher health insurance and benefit costs, less favorable material pricing and inventory adjustments and reserves. Overall, cost of sales reflects changes in sales volume and product mix.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expense increased $0.8 million, or 5%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, despite a $0.5 million decrease in allocated corporate costs during this period. The overall $1.3 million increase reflects some additional administrative headcount, normal wage inflation, and higher medical insurance and employee benefit costs year-over-year.\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges of $0.9 million represent equipment moving and other related costs associated with the Mexican plant closure effected in October 2016 and a Kansas plant closure effected in September 2017.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.4 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Of this increase, $0.2 million was associated with accelerated depreciation of assets at the Kansas plant, closed in September 2017. The incremental depreciation and amortization expense associated with property, plant and equipment placed into service during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, slightly exceeded the run-off of depreciation expense associated with existing assets and disposals during this period.\nUnallocated Corporate & Other Table 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended October 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales. Net sales for Unallocated Corporate & Other represents the elimination of inter-segment sales for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 and 2016. The change between periods reflects the amount of inter-segment sales (primarily\nbetween NA Engineered Components and EU Engineered Components related to a change in the terms of a royalty agreement in 2017).\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales for Corporate & Other consists of the elimination of inter-segment profit in inventory and changes in the LIFO reserve adjustments and other costs. The change for the twelve-month periods ended October 31, 2017 and 2016 of $2.6 million was primarily related to the elimination of inter-segment sales and a decrease in the LIFO reserve of $0.3 million in 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $5.9 million, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, despite a $2.1 million decrease in the amount of corporate expense allocated to the operating segments in 2017 compared to 2016. Therefore, the overall decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is $8.0 million. Of this amount, a net decrease of $4.7 million relates to transaction costs, as the prior year included $5.2 million associated with the Woodcraft acquisition. The remainder of the difference relates primarily to lower professional fees as we received $4.0 million of insurance reimbursement in 2017 for legal fees incurred defending an alleged product defect claim.
