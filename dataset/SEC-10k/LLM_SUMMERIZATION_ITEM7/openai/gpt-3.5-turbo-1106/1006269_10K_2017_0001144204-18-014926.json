Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements (the financial statements\u201d) included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLoral Space & Communications Inc., a Delaware corporation, together with its subsidiaries, is a leading satellite communications company engaged, through our ownership interests in affiliates, in satellite-based communications services.\nDisclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nExcept for the historical information contained in the following discussion and analysis, the matters discussed below are not historical facts, but are forward-looking statements\u201d as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Loral participates in satellite services operations primarily through its ownership interest in Telesat, a leading global satellite operator. Telesat provides its satellite and communication services from a fleet of satellites that occupy Canadian and other orbital locations.\nLoral holds a 62.7% economic interest and a 32.7% voting interest in Telesat as of December 31, 2017. Our economic interest decreased from 62.8% to 62.7% in March 2016 when certain Telesat employees exercised share appreciation rights related to a total of 178,642 stock options granted under Telesat's share-based compensation plan and received 129,400 non-voting participating preferred shares.\nAt December 31, 2017, Telesat, with approximately $3.0 billion of backlog, provided satellite services to customers from its fleet of 15 in-orbit geostationary satellites. In addition, Telesat owns the Canadian Ka-band payload on the ViaSat-1 satellite and has two other geostationary satellites under construction. In January 2018, an additional satellite was launched into low earth orbit as part of Telesat's plan to deploy an advanced, global LEO constellation that will deliver low latency fiber-like broadband to commercial and government users worldwide. Telesat also manages the operations of additional satellites for third parties.\nThe satellite services business is capital intensive and the build-out of a satellite fleet requires substantial time and investment. Once the investment in a satellite is made, the incremental costs to maintain and operate the satellite are relatively low over the life of the satellite, with the exception of in-orbit insurance. Telesat has been able to generate a large contracted revenue backlog by entering into long-term contracts with some of its customers for all or substantially all of a satellite's life. Historically, this has resulted in revenue from the satellite services business being fairly predictable.\nTelesat's desirable spectrum rights, commitment to providing the highest level of customer service, deep technical expertise and culture of innovation have enabled it to successfully develop its business to date. Leveraging these strengths and building on its existing contractual revenue backlog, Telesat's focus is on profitably growing its business by increasing the utilization of its in-orbit satellites and, in a disciplined manner, deploying expansion satellite capacity where strong market demand is anticipated. Telesat currently has two geostationary satellites, Telstar 18 VANTAGE and Telstar 19 VANTAGE, under construction.\nTelesat believes that it is well positioned to serve its customers and the markets in which it participates. Telesat actively pursues opportunities to develop new satellites, particularly in conjunction with current or prospective customers who will commit to long-term service agreements prior to the time the satellite construction contract is signed. However, while Telesat regularly pursues these opportunities, it does not procure additional or replacement satellites until it believes there is a demonstrated need and a sound business plan for such satellite capacity.\nIn 2018, Telesat remains focused on increasing utilization of its existing satellites, the construction and launch of its new satellites, the development of its global LEO constellation and identifying and pursuing opportunities to invest in expansion satellite capacity, all while maintaining operating discipline.\nOn November 17, 2016, Telesat entered into amended senior secured credit facilities which provide for term loan borrowings of $2.43 billion which mature on November 17, 2023 and revolving credit borrowings of up to $200 million (or Canadian dollar equivalent) which mature on November 17, 2021. Telesat also issued, through a private placement, $500 million of 8.875% senior notes which mature on November 17, 2024.\nOn November 17, 2016, Telesat repaid all outstanding amounts under its former senior secured credit facilities and its 6.0% senior notes.\nOn February 1, 2017, Telesat amended the senior secured credit facilities to effectively reprice the then outstanding term loan borrowings of $2.424 billion.\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTelesat's operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate variations. During 2017, approximately 52% of Telesat's revenues, 42% of its operating expenses, 100% of its interest expense and a majority of its capital expenditures were denominated in U.S. dollars. The most significant impact of variations in the exchange rate is on the U.S. dollar denominated indebtedness and cash and short-term investments. As of December 31, 2017, Telesat's U.S. dollar denominated debt totaled $2.9 billion. As of December 31, 2017, a five percent increase (decrease) in the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar would have increased (decreased) Telesat's net income by approximately $129 million. This analysis assumes all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.\nSale of SSL\nOn November 2, 2012, Loral completed the Sale of SSL to MDA. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement dated as of June 26, 2012, as amended on October 30, 2012 and March 28, 2013, by and among Loral, SSL, MDA and MDA Holdings, Loral agreed to indemnify MDA and its affiliates from certain damages in the ViaSat Suit brought in 2012 by ViaSat against Loral and SSL. On September 5, 2014, Loral, SSL and ViaSat entered into the Settlement Agreement pursuant to which the ViaSat Suit and an additional patent infringement and breach of contract lawsuit brought by ViaSat against SSL in September 2013 were settled. Loral was also released by MDA, MDA Holdings and SSL from indemnification claims relating to the ViaSat lawsuits under the Purchase Agreement. The terms of the Settlement Agreement provided, among other things, for payment by Loral and SSL to ViaSat on a joint and several basis of $100 million, $40 million of which was paid in September 2014 in connection with entering into the Settlement Agreement, with the remaining $60 million payable with interest in ten equal quarterly installments of $6.9 million from October 15, 2014 through January 15, 2017.\nFollowing a mediation session held on December 1, 2014, Loral and MDA entered into the Allocation Agreement, pursuant to which Loral and MDA agreed that Loral was responsible for $45 million, and MDA and SSL were responsible for $55 million, of the $100 million litigation settlement with ViaSat. Culminating with the final installment payment of $2.8 million in January 2017, Loral paid a total of $46.1 million, including interest, as its share of the ViaSat settlement (see Note 13 to the financial statements).\nGeneral\nOur principal asset is our majority ownership interest in Telesat. In an effort to maximize shareholder value, we have been exploring, and are in discussions with PSP regarding, potential strategic transactions to alter the status quo in our ownership of Telesat. Subject to market conditions and the cooperation of PSP, we continue to explore the combination of Loral and Telesat into one public company and/or the sale of Loral in connection with a sale of Telesat. Also, as described more fully below, we have exercised our right to require that Telesat initiate a public offering, and we may further pursue this right in the event a combination transaction or a sale of Telesat is not likely to be achievable in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms. There can be no assurance as to whether or when we will be able to conclude any strategic transaction or that any strategic initiatives or transaction involving Telesat or Loral may occur, or that any particular economic, tax, structural or other objectives or benefits with respect to any initiative or transaction involving Telesat or Loral's interest therein will be achieved.\nIn the first quarter of 2017, we received $242.7 million in cash from Telesat, representing our share of an aggregate approximately $400 million distribution from Telesat to its shareholders and stock option holders. We intend to use the proceeds of such distribution, net of reasonable reserves for working capital and other liabilities, to make a distribution to our stockholders. There can be no assurance as to the amount and timing of any such distribution, and such distribution may be impacted by the outcome of our discussions regarding, and the structure of, the strategic combination transaction that we are pursuing.\nAs mentioned above, we have the right under the Telesat Shareholders Agreement to require Telesat to conduct an initial public offering of its equity shares, and, in July 2015, we exercised this right. Specifically, we requested that Telesat issue not more than 25 million newly issued shares of Telesat voting common stock. We also requested the termination of the Shareholders Agreement and the elimination of certain provisions in Telesat's Articles of Incorporation, both of which we believe are important for a successful public offering. If those provisions are eliminated, an impediment to the conversion of our non-voting Telesat shares to voting shares would be eliminated. Termination or modification of the Shareholders Agreement and conversion of our non-voting shares to voting shares would enable us, after a Telesat IPO and subject to the receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, to obtain majority voting control of Telesat. Telesat selected two co-managing underwriters and informed us that it will work to implement a Telesat IPO pending our agreement with PSP on governance matters following a Telesat IPO. To date, no such agreement has been reached. In the event a combination transaction that we are pursuing or a sale of Telesat as described above is not likely to be achievable in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms, we may further pursue our right to a Telesat IPO. There can be no assurance as to whether, when or on what terms a Telesat IPO, termination or modification of the Shareholders Agreement or any requested changes to Telesat's Articles of Incorporation may occur or that any particular economic, tax, structural or other objectives or benefits with respect to a Telesat IPO will be achieved. If a Telesat IPO is expected to proceed under unfavorable terms or at an unfavorable price, we may withdraw our demand for a Telesat IPO.\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepending upon the outcome of the strategic initiatives discussed above, we may assert certain claims against PSP for actions we believe violated our rights relating to the affairs of Telesat under the Telesat Shareholders Agreement and otherwise. In response to our claims, PSP has informed us that it believes that it may have claims against us, although we are not aware of the legal or factual basis for any such claims. We and PSP have agreed that, pending the outcome of our discussions relating to Telesat, it would be beneficial to delay the commencement of any action relating to either party's claims and have entered into an agreement (the Tolling Agreement\u201d) which preserves the parties' rights to assert against one another legal claims relating to Telesat. We also included Telesat as a party to the Tolling Agreement because, as a technical matter of Canadian law and for purposes of potentially seeking equitable relief, Telesat may be a necessary party. There can be no assurance that if the Tolling Agreement lapses that we and PSP will not pursue legal claims against one another relating to Telesat. If we pursue claims against PSP, there can be no assurance that our claims will be successful or that the relief we seek will be granted. If PSP pursues claims against us, there can be no assurance that PSP will not prevail on its claims.\nLoral may, from time to time, explore and evaluate other possible strategic transactions and alliances which may include joint ventures and strategic relationships as well as business combinations or the acquisition or disposition of assets. In order to pursue certain of these opportunities, additional funds are likely to be required. There can be no assurance that we will enter into additional strategic transactions or alliances, nor do we know if we will be able to obtain the necessary financing for transactions that require additional funds on favorable terms, if at all.\nIn connection with the acquisition of our ownership interest in Telesat in 2007, Loral has agreed that, subject to certain exceptions described in the Shareholders Agreement, for so long as Loral has an interest in Telesat, it will not compete in the business of leasing, selling or otherwise furnishing fixed satellite service, broadcast satellite service or audio and video broadcast direct to home service using transponder capacity in the C-band, Ku-band and Ka-band (including in each case extended band) frequencies and the business of providing end-to-end data solutions on networks comprised of earth terminals, space segment, and, where appropriate, networking hubs.\nConsolidated Operating Results\nPlease refer to Critical Accounting Matters set forth below in this section.\nCompared with 2016 and 2016 Compared with 2015\nThe following compares our consolidated results for 2017, 2016 and 2015 as presented in our financial statements:\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,935 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,530 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to a $0.8 million increase in professional fees and a $0.3 million decrease in pension charges allocated to XTAR.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to $0.8 million of income earned during the year ended December 31, 2015 under the ViaSat-1 revenue share arrangement with Telesat which expired in December 2015 (see Note 14 to the financial statements) and a $0.3 million increase in professional fees, partially offset by pension charges to XTAR of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $0.3 million reduction in accrued expenses and a $0.2 million reduction in consulting charges.\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest and Investment Income\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest and investment income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest and investment income for 2017, 2016 and 2015 consists primarily of interest on our cash balance.

For 2016, we recorded a current tax benefit of $1.0 million and a deferred tax provision of $29.5 million, resulting in a total tax provision of $28.5 million. For 2015, we recorded a current tax benefit of $5.8 million and a deferred tax benefit of $39.7 million, resulting in a total tax benefit of $45.5 million.\nThe deferred tax (provision) benefit for each period included the impact of equity in net income (loss) of affiliates in our consolidated statement of operations.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S tax code, such as the imposition of a one-time transition tax in 2017 on certain unrepatriated earnings of controlled foreign corporations, including Telesat, and numerous changes first effective in 2018 including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) eliminating U.S federal income taxes on dividends from certain foreign investments, such as Telesat; (3) requiring a current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations, including Telesat; (4) limiting the use of FTCs to reduce U.S. federal tax liability; (5) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax ( AMT\u201d) and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized; (6) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax, a new minimum tax; (7) creating a new limit on deductible interest expense; and (8) changing the rules related to the use of NOL carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. We recognized the income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implication of the Tax Cuts and Job Act (SAB 118), in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. SAB 118 provides guidance for the application of income tax accounting standards related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Based upon our analysis, as of December 31, 2017, we reduced deferred tax assets by $33.2 million related to the tax rate reduction with a corresponding increase to our deferred income tax provision and increased non-current income taxes receivable by $1.6 million related to refundable AMT credits with a corresponding reduction to deferred tax assets. The preliminary effect recorded may change in the future due to revisions in the interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or legislative action to clarify interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company expects to finalize the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with the filing of its 2017 tax return and record in the fourth quarter of 2018 any difference between the final effect and the provisional effect recorded.\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe current tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 included our anticipated income tax liability related to the cash distribution received from Telesat after use of AMT credits and NOL carryforwards and FTCs from Telesat. Upon receiving the cash distribution from Telesat in the first quarter of 2017, we recorded a current tax liability of $53.0 million. During 2017, we made tax payments of $12.5 million, primarily with respect to the distribution, and commenced a tax study to determine the allowable amount of FTCs that could be utilized to minimize our cash tax liability. After completing our analysis in the fourth quarter of 2017, we reduced our current tax liability to approximately $2.0 million and established a deferred tax asset of $104.9 million for the carryforward of unused FTCs. Since, at the current time, sufficient positive evidence does not exist to support full recovery of the FTC carryforward, we recorded a full valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset during the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had no income taxes payable and a current income tax receivable of $11.1 million, primarily related to recovery of tax payments previously made on the cash distribution.\nFor each period presented, the statute of limitations for the assessment of additional tax expired with regard to several of our federal and state uncertain tax positions ( UTPs\u201d) and certain other UTPs were settled. As a result, the reduction to our liability for UTPs provided a current tax benefit including the reversal of previously recognized interest and penalties, partially offset by an additional provision for the potential payment of interest on our remaining UTPs.\nSubsequent to the Sale, to the extent that profitability from operations is not sufficient to realize the benefit from our remaining net deferred tax assets, we would generate sufficient taxable income from the appreciated value of our Telesat investment in order to prevent federal net operating losses from expiring and realize the benefit of all remaining deferred tax assets.\nSee Critical Accounting Matters - Taxation below for discussion of our accounting method for income taxes.\nEquity in Net Income (Loss) of Affiliates\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Telesat </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>216,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(74,329 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>XTAR </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30,463 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>216,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(104,792 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following is a reconciliation of the changes in our investment in Telesat for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Opening Balance, January 1, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>107,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Less: Cash distribution received </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(242,735 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Components of equity in net income of Telesat: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Equity in net income of Telesat </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>212,001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>140,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Eliminations of affiliate transactions and related amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,346 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Recognition of equity loss suspended as of prior year-end </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>216,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(57,924 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84,078 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Components of equity in other comprehensive income of Telesat: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Equity in other comprehensive (loss) income of Telesat </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28,132 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Recognition of equity in other comprehensive income suspended as of prior year-end </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28,132 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,872 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Ending balance, December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,430 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>107,950 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2016, we held a 62.7% economic interest and a 32.7% voting interest in Telesat. Loral's equity in net income of Telesat is based on our proportionate share of Telesat's results in accordance with U.S. GAAP and in U.S. dollars. The amortization of Telesat fair value adjustments applicable to the Loral Skynet assets and liabilities acquired by Telesat in 2007 is proportionately eliminated in determining our share of the net income or loss of Telesat. Our equity in net income or loss of Telesat also reflects amortization of profits eliminated, to the extent of our economic interest in Telesat, on satellites we constructed for Telesat while we owned SSL and on Loral's sale to Telesat in April 2011 of its portion of the payload on the ViaSat-1 satellite and related assets.\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had an unrecorded equity loss in Telesat of $57.9 million, the amount by which our share of Telesat's losses together with cash distributions we received from Telesat exceeded our recorded cumulative equity in net income of Telesat and our initial investment in Telesat. In following the equity method of accounting, our investment balance in Telesat was reduced to zero as of December 31, 2015. In addition, our equity in Telesat's other comprehensive income that we could not record as of December 31, 2015 was $20.8 million. We recognized this $57.9 million equity loss and our $20.8 million share in the equity of Telesat's other comprehensive income in 2016.\nSummary financial information for Telesat in accordance with

December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due primarily to an increase in short-term services provided to other satellite operators, higher enterprise services revenue from mobility sector customers and the favorable impact of the change in the U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar exchange rate on Canadian dollar denominated revenue, partially offset by the end of service or service reductions for certain North American broadcast services customers and certain enterprise services customers and lower equipment sales.

Telesat's revenue excluding foreign exchange impact would have decreased by $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTelesat's operating expenses increased by $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the special payment made to stock option holders in the first quarter of 2017 in connection with the cash distribution made to Telesat's shareholders, higher professional fees, higher performance-based compensation and the unfavorable impact of the change in in the U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar exchange rate on Canadian dollar denominated expenses, partially offset by lower expense on development of LEO satellites, lower share based compensation and lower cost of sales from lower third-party satellite capacity expenses. Telesat's operating expenses excluding foreign exchange impact increased by $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTelesat's operating expenses decreased by $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to lower third party satellite capacity expenses, lower in-orbit insurance expenses, lower Canadian spectrum license fees, lower equipment sales and the favorable impact of the change in the U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar exchange rate on Canadian dollar denominated expenses, partially offset by an $11.9 million expense related to development of LEO satellites in 2016 and increased performance-based compensation and certain employee benefits expenses. Telesat's operating expenses excluding foreign exchange impact would have increased by $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTelesat's loss on refinancing of $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily represents the write-off of deferred financing costs, interest rate floors, prepayment option and premiums on Telesat's former senior secured credit facilities and 6.0% senior notes as a result of the refinancing in November 2016.\nTelesat's operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate variations to the extent that transactions are made in currencies other than Canadian dollars. Telesat's main currency exposures as of December 31, 2017, lie in its U.S. dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt financing. The most significant impact of variations in the exchange rate is on the U.S. dollar denominated debt financing. As of December 31, 2017, Telesat's U.S. dollar denominated debt totaled $2.9 billion. As of December 31, 2017, a five percent increase (decrease) in the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar would have increased (decreased) Telesat's net income by approximately $129 million. This analysis assumes all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.\nThe equity losses in XTAR, our 56% owned joint venture, during 2015 represent our share of XTAR losses incurred in connection with its operations and other-than-temporary impairment of our investment in XTAR due to a decline in its fair value.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying value of our investment in XTAR was zero. Beginning January 1, 2016, we discontinued providing for our allocated share of XTAR's net losses as our investment was reduced to zero as of December 31, 2015 and we have no commitment to provide further financial support. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded other-than-temporary, non-cash, impairment charges of $21.2 million related to our investment in XTAR primarily as a result of an increase in the discount rate used to value our investment in XTAR and reassessment of our revenue expectations for future years dictated by a decline in XTAR's revenues by approximately 11% from 2014 to 2015. The value of our investment in XTAR was determined based on the income approach by discounting projected annual cash flows to their present value using a rate of return appropriate for the risk of achieving the projected cash flows.\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss from Discontinued Operations, net of tax\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(370 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(778 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjustments to amounts previously reported in discontinued operations and interest expense that is directly related to the Sale are classified as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

It is expected that approximately 18.8% of satellite services backlog will be recognized as revenue by Telesat during 2018. As of December 31, 2017, Telesat had received approximately $310 million of customer prepayments.\nCritical Accounting Matters\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income (loss) reported for the period. Actual results could differ from estimates. We believe the following critical accounting matters contain the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nEvaluation of Investments in Affiliates for Impairment\nThe carrying value of our investments in affiliates is reviewed for impairment in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Codification Topic 323 Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures. We monitor our equity method investments for factors indicating other-than-temporary decrease in value. An impairment charge would be recognized when the decrease in value is determined to be other-than-temporary. The fair value of each investment is determined based on the income approach by discounting our investee's projected annual free cash flows to their present value using a rate of return appropriate for the risk of achieving the projected cash flows. We recorded impairment charges of $21.2 million related to our investment in XTAR for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFair Value Measurements\nU.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants. U.S. GAAP also establishes a fair value hierarchy that gives the highest priority to observable inputs and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\nLevel 1: Inputs represent a fair value that is derived from unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets at the measurement date.\nLevel 2: Inputs represent a fair value that is derived from quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities, and pricing inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.\nLevel 3: Inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques.\nThese provisions are applicable to all of our assets and liabilities that are measured and recorded at fair value.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\nThe following table presents our assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2017:\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Level 1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Level 2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Level 3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash equivalents: Money market funds </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>251,742 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other current assets: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Indemnification - Sale of SSL </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,410 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Long term liabilities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Indemnification - Globalstar do Brasil S.A. </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>293 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.\nThe Company did not have any non-financial assets or non-financial liabilities that were recognized or disclosed at fair value as of December 31, 2017.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis\nWe review the carrying values of our equity method investments when events and circumstances warrant and consider all available evidence in evaluating when declines in fair value are other-than-temporary. The fair values of our investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge would be recorded when the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its current fair value and is determined to be other-than-temporary.\nThe asset resulting from the indemnification of SSL is for certain pre-closing taxes and reflects the excess of payments since inception over the estimated liability, which was originally determined using the fair value objective approach. The estimated liability for indemnifications relating to Globalstar do Brasil S.A. ( GdB\u201d), originally determined using expected value analysis, is net of payments since inception.\nTaxation\nLoral is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxation on its worldwide income and foreign taxes on certain income from sources outside the United States. Our foreign subsidiaries are subject to taxation in local jurisdictions. Telesat is subject to tax in Canada and other jurisdictions and Loral will provide in operating earnings any additional U.S. current and deferred tax required on distributions received or deemed to be received from Telesat.\nWe use the liability method in accounting for taxes whereby income taxes are recognized during the year in which transactions are recorded in the financial statements. Deferred taxes reflect the future tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting and are measured by applying anticipated statutory tax rates in effect for the year during which the differences are expected to reverse. We assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and, based upon this analysis, record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets to the extent recoverability does not satisfy the more likely than not\u201d recognition criteria.\nThe tax benefit of a UTP taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns is recognized only if it is more likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefit recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes in income tax expense on a quarterly basis.\nThe unrecognized tax benefit of a UTP is recognized in the period when the UTP is effectively settled. Previously recognized tax positions are derecognized in the first period in which it is no longer more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination. Evaluating the technical merits of a tax position and determining the benefit to be recognized involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying such evaluation.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPension and Other Employee Benefits\nWe maintain a qualified pension plan, which is a defined benefit pension plan. In addition to providing pension benefits, we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees and dependents. Effective January 1, 2015, we discontinued retiree medical coverage for Medicare eligible retirees and their dependents. Pension and other employee postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in these pension and other employee postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions, as well as our actual experience.\nThe discount rate is subject to change each year, based on a hypothetical yield curve developed from a portfolio of high quality, corporate, non-callable bonds with maturities that match our projected benefit payment stream. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of the plan liability cash flows to the yield curve. The discount rate determined on this basis for the qualified pension plan and other employee postretirement benefit costs was 3.5% and 4.0% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the expected duration of the plan's projected benefit obligation, asset mix and the fact that its assets are actively managed to mitigate risk. Allowable investment types include equity investments, fixed income investments and real assets. Both equity and fixed income investment types may include alternative investments which are permitted to be up to 20% of total plan assets. Pension plan assets are primarily managed by Russell Investment Corp. ( Russell\u201d), which allocates the assets into specified Russell-designed funds as we direct. Each specified Russell fund is then managed by investment managers chosen by Russell. We also engage non-Russell related investment managers through Russell, in its role as trustee, to invest pension plan assets. The targeted long-term allocation of our pension plan assets is 56.5% in liquid return-seeking investments, 29% in fixed income investments and 14.5% in alternative investments. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 6.75% for 2017, 7.00% for 2016 and 7.25% for 2015. For 2018, we have updated our expected long-term rate of return to 7.25%.\nPension and other employee postretirement benefit costs included in income from continuing operations in 2018 are expected to be approximately $1.1 million, compared with $1.6 million in 2017. Lowering the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return each by 0.5% would have increased benefit costs by approximately $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in 2017.\nThe benefit obligations for pensions and other employee postretirement benefits exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $18.9 million at December 31, 2017. We are required to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan on our balance sheet. Market conditions and interest rates significantly affect future assets and liabilities of Loral's pension and other employee benefits plans.\nContingencies\nContingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss, if any. We accrue for costs relating to litigation, claims and other contingent matters when, in management's opinion, such liabilities become probable and reasonably estimable. Such estimates may be based on advice from third parties or on management's judgment, as appropriate. Actual amounts paid may differ from amounts estimated, and such differences will be charged to operations in the period in which the final determination of the liability is made. Management considers the assessment of loss contingencies as a critical accounting policy because of the significant uncertainty relating to the outcome of any potential legal actions and other claims and the difficulty of predicting the likelihood and range of the potential liability involved, coupled with the material impact on our results of operations that could result from legal actions or other claims and assessments.\nAccounting Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented\nFor discussion of accounting standards issued and not yet implemented that could have an impact on us, see Note 2 to the financial statements.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLoral\nAs described above, Loral's principal asset is a 62.7% economic interest in Telesat. We also have a 56% economic interest in XTAR. The operations of Telesat and XTAR are not consolidated but are presented using the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2017, the value of our investment in XTAR was zero as a result of the decline in its fair value that was determined to be other-than-temporary.\nLoral has no debt. Telesat has third party debt with financial institutions. XTAR has no external debt other than to its LLC member, Hisdesat, for restructured lease payments on the Spainsat satellite. XTAR is required to make payments of $5 million per year to pay down the outstanding restructured lease balance. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, XTAR had deferred payment of liabilities to Hisdesat of $32.7 million and $28.8 million, respectively, for lease payments, including the restructured lease payments. The Company has not provided a guarantee for the debt of Telesat or XTAR.\nCash is maintained at Loral, Telesat and XTAR to support the operating needs of each respective entity. The ability of Telesat to pay dividends or certain other restricted payments in cash to Loral is governed by applicable covenants relating to its debt and its shareholder agreement. The ability of XTAR to pay dividends and management fees in cash to Loral is governed by its operating agreement.\nCash and Available Credit\nAt December 31, 2017, Loral had $255.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and no debt. The Company's cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 increased by $217.7 million from December 31, 2016 due primarily to a cash distribution by Telesat of $242.7 million and interest income received of $2.2 million, partially offset by net payments of $12.5 million for income taxes primarily related to the cash distribution, corporate expenses of $6.5 million, adjusted for changes in working capital and net of consulting fees from Telesat, a $2.8 million payment to ViaSat pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and Allocation Agreement, litigation expenditures of $1.1 million, postretirement benefits funding of $2.3 million and payments of $2.0 million related to strategic initiatives. A discussion of cash changes by activity is set forth in the sections, Net Cash Used in Operating Activities,\u201d Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities,\u201d and Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities.\u201d\nThe Company did not have a credit facility as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nCash Management\nWe have a cash management investment program that seeks a competitive return while maintaining a conservative risk profile. Our cash management investment policy establishes what we believe to be conservative guidelines relating to the investment of surplus cash. The policy allows us to invest in commercial paper, money market funds and other similar short-term investments but does not permit us to engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor does it permit us to hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The cash management investment policy was designed to preserve capital and safeguard principal, to meet all of our liquidity requirements and to provide a competitive rate of return for similar risk categories of investment. The policy addresses dealer qualifications, lists approved securities, establishes minimum acceptable credit ratings, sets concentration limits, defines a maturity structure, requires all firms to safe keep securities on our behalf, requires certain mandatory reporting activity and discusses review of the portfolio. We operate the cash management investment program under the guidelines of our investment policy and continuously monitor the investments to avoid risks.\nWe currently invest our cash in several liquid Prime and Government AAA money market funds. The dispersion across funds reduces the exposure of a default at one fund.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund projected expenditures during 2018. We expect that our major cash outlays during 2018 will include income tax payments, payments under employee benefit programs and general corporate expenses net of consulting fees from Telesat.\nIn the first quarter of 2017, we received $242.7 million in cash from Telesat, representing our share of an aggregate approximately $400 million distribution from Telesat to its shareholders and stock option holders. We intend to use the proceeds of such distribution, net of reasonable reserves for working capital and other liabilities, to make a distribution to our stockholders. There can be no assurance as to the amount and timing of any such distribution, and such distribution may be impacted by the outcome of our discussions regarding, and the structure of, the strategic combination transaction with respect to our interest in Telesat that we are pursuing.\nRisks to Cash Flow\nIn the fourth quarter of 2012, we sold our former subsidiary, SSL, to MDA pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we are obligated to indemnify MDA from liabilities with respect to certain pre-closing taxes the total amount of which has not yet been determined. Where appropriate, we intend vigorously to contest the underlying tax assessments, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful. Although no assurance can be provided, we do not believe that these tax-related matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nTelesat\nCash and Available Credit\nAs of December 31, 2017, Telesat had CAD 479 million of cash and short-term investments as well as approximately $200 million of borrowing availability under its revolving credit facility.\nLiquidity\nA large portion of Telesat's annual cash receipts are reasonably predictable because they are primarily derived from an existing backlog of long-term customer contracts and high contract renewal rates. Telesat believes its cash and short-term investments as of December 31, 2017, cash flows from operating activities, and drawings on the revolving credit facility under its senior secured credit facilities will be adequate to meet Telesat's expected cash requirements for at least the next 12 months for activities in the normal course of business, including capital requirements and required interest and principal payments on debt.\nThe construction of any satellite replacement or expansion program will require significant capital expenditures. Telesat may choose to invest in new satellites to further grow its business. Cash required for current and future satellite construction programs may be funded from some or all of the following: cash and short-term investments, cash flow from operating activities, cash flow from customer prepayments or through borrowings on the revolving credit facility under Telesat's senior secured credit facilities. In addition, Telesat may sell certain satellite assets and, in accordance with the terms and conditions of Telesat's senior secured credit facilities, reinvest the proceeds in replacement satellites or pay down indebtedness under Telesat's senior secured credit facilities. Subject to market conditions and subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of its senior secured credit facilities and the financial leverage covenant tests therein, Telesat may also have the ability to obtain additional secured or unsecured financing to fund current or future satellite construction. Telesat's ability to access these sources of funding, however, is not guaranteed, and therefore, Telesat may not be able to fully fund additional replacement or new satellite construction programs.\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>55 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt\nTelesat's debt as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity </td> <td> </td> <td>Currency </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Senior secured credit facilities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revolving credit facility </td> <td> </td> <td>November 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>USD or CAD equivalent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Term Loan B - U.S. facility </td> <td> </td> <td>November 2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>USD </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,399,686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,423,925 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>8.875% Senior notes </td> <td> </td> <td>November 2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>USD </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>500,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>500,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,899,686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,923,925 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Less: Deferred financing costs, interest rate floors and prepayment options </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(80,994 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(58,336 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total debt under international financial reporting standards </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,818,692 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,865,589 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>U.S. GAAP adjustments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,361 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total debt under U.S. GAAP </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,829,911 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,877,950 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Current portion </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,182 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Long term portion </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,816,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,859,768 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn November 17, 2016, Telesat entered into amended senior secured credit facilities which provide for term loan borrowings of $2.43 billion which mature on November 17, 2023 and revolving credit borrowings of up to $200 million (or Canadian dollar equivalent) which mature on November 17, 2021. Telesat also issued, through a private placement, $500 million of 8.875% senior notes which mature on November 17, 2024.\nOn November 17, 2016, Telesat repaid all outstanding amounts under its former senior secured credit facilities and its 6.0% senior notes.\nOn February 1, 2017, Telesat amended the senior secured credit facilities to effectively reprice the then outstanding term loan borrowings of $2.424 billion.\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities\nThe obligations under Telesat's new credit agreement and the guarantees of those obligations are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by a first priority security interest in the assets of Telesat and certain of its subsidiaries (the Guarantors\u201d). The credit agreement contains covenants that restrict the ability of Telesat and the Guarantors to take specified actions, including, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions: creating liens, incurring indebtedness, making investments, engaging in mergers, selling property, paying dividends, entering into sale-leaseback transactions, creating subsidiaries, repaying subordinated debt or amending organizational documents. The credit agreement also requires Telesat and the Guarantors to comply with a maximum first lien leverage ratio and contains customary events of default and affirmative covenants, including an excess cash sweep, that may require Telesat to repay a portion of the outstanding principal under its senior secured credit facilities prior to the stated maturity.\nTelesat's senior secured credit facilities are comprised of the following facilities:\ni - Revolving Credit Facility\nTelesat's revolving credit facility ( Revolving Facility\u201d) is a $200 million loan facility available in either U.S. dollar or Canadian dollar equivalent, maturing on November 17, 2021. Loans under the Revolving Facility bear interest at a floating interest rate. For Canadian Prime Rate and Alternative Base Rate ( ABR\u201d) loans, an applicable margin ranging from 1.5% to 2.00% is applied to the Prime Rate and ABR as these interest rates are defined in the senior credit facilities. For Bankers Acceptance ( BA\u201d) Loans and Eurodollar Loans, an applicable margin ranging from 2.50% to 3.00% is applied to either the BA interest rate or LIBOR. The rates on the Revolving Facility vary depending upon the results of the first lien leverage ratio. Telesat's Revolving Facility currently has an unused commitment fee of 40 basis points. As at December 31, 2017, other than approximately CAD 0.2 million in drawings related to letters of credit, there were no borrowings under this facility.\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nii - Term Loan B - U.S. Facility\nTelesat's term loan B - U.S. facility ( U.S. TLB Facility\u201d) is a $2.430 billion loan maturing on November 17, 2023. As of December 31, 2017, $2.4 billion of this facility was outstanding, which represents the full amount available following mandatory repayments. The initial terms had the outstanding borrowings under the U.S. TLB Facility bear interest at a floating rate of either: (i) LIBOR as periodically determined for interest rate periods selected by Telesat in accordance with the terms of the senior secured credit facilities, but not less than 0.75%, plus an initial applicable margin of 3.00%; or (ii) Alternative Base Rate as determined in accordance with the terms of the senior secured credit facilities plus an applicable margin of 2.00%. On February 1, 2017, Telesat amended the Senior Secured Credit Facilities to reduce the applicable margin to 3.00% from 3.75% on the then outstanding $2.424 billion. As at February 1, 2017, the mandatory principal repayments on the U.S. TLB Facility are one quarter of 1.00% of the value of the loan at the time of the amendment, which must be paid on the last day of each quarter.\nSenior Notes\nTelesat's senior notes of $500 million bear interest at an annual rate of 8.875% and are due November 17, 2024. They include covenants or terms that restrict Telesat's ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, investments or acquisitions, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, modify or cancel Telesat's satellite insurance, effect mergers with another entity, and redeem Telesat's senior notes, without penalty, before November 15, 2022, in each case subject to exceptions provided in the senior notes indenture.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Telesat was in compliance with the financial covenants of its senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing the senior notes.\nDebt Service Cost\nTelesat's interest expense for the year ending December 31, 2017 was approximately CAD 197 million.\nDerivatives\nTelesat uses, from time to time, interest rate and currency derivatives to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Telesat had four outstanding interest rate swaps which hedge the interest rate risk on $1.8 billion of U.S. denominated Term Loan B borrowings. As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of $13.8 million. These contracts, which mature between September 2019 and September 2022, are at fixed interest rates ranging from 1.72% to 2.04%, excluding applicable margin.\nTelesat also has foreign currency embedded derivatives in its purchase contracts with suppliers and sales contracts with customers as a result of some of these contracts being denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the substantial parties to the respective contract. The fair value of these foreign currency embedded derivatives as of December 31, 2017 was CAD 6.3 million.\nCapital Expenditures\nTelesat has entered into contracts for the construction and launch of satellites and other capital expenditures. The outstanding commitments associated with these contracts were approximately CAD 52 million as of December 31, 2017. These expenditures may be funded from some or all of the following: cash and short-term investments, cash flow from operating activities, cash flow from customer prepayments or funds available under the Revolving Facility.\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments\nThe following table aggregates Loral's contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period (2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 Years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lease payments(1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>Represents future minimum payments under operating leases. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>Does not include our liabilities for UTPs of $61.2 million.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements (the financial statements\u201d) included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLoral Space & Communications Inc., a Delaware corporation, together with its subsidiaries, is a leading satellite communications company engaged, through our ownership interests in affiliates, in satellite-based communications services.\nDisclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nExcept for the historical information contained in the following discussion and analysis, the matters discussed below are not historical facts, but are forward-looking statements\u201d as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, we or our representatives have made and may continue to make forward-looking statements, orally or in writing, in other contexts. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as believes,\u201d expects,\u201d plans,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d would,\u201d could,\u201d should,\u201d anticipates,\u201d estimates,\u201d project,\u201d intend,\u201d or outlook\u201d or other variations of these words. These statements, including without limitation those relating to Telesat, are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict or quantify.

For a detailed discussion of these and other factors and conditions, please refer to the Risk Factors section above, the Commitments and Contingencies section below and to our other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d). We operate in an industry sector in which the value of securities may be volatile and may be influenced by economic and other factors beyond our control. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\n 43 \nOverview\nBusiness\nLoral has one operating segment consisting of satellite-based communications services. Loral participates in satellite services operations primarily through its ownership interest in Telesat, a leading global satellite operator. Telesat provides its satellite and communication services from a fleet of satellites that occupy Canadian and other orbital locations.\nLoral holds a 62.7% economic interest and a 32.7% voting interest in Telesat as of December 31, 2017. Our economic interest decreased from 62.8% to 62.7% in March 2016 when certain Telesat employees exercised share appreciation rights related to a total of 178,642 stock options granted under Telesat's share-based compensation plan and received 129,400 non-voting participating preferred shares.\nAt December 31, 2017, Telesat, with approximately $3.0 billion of backlog, provided satellite services to customers from its fleet of 15 in-orbit geostationary satellites. In addition, Telesat owns the Canadian Ka-band payload on the ViaSat-1 satellite and has two other geostationary satellites under construction. In January 2018, an additional satellite was launched into low earth orbit as part of Telesat's plan to deploy an advanced, global LEO constellation that will deliver low latency fiber-like broadband to commercial and government users worldwide. Telesat also manages the operations of additional satellites for third parties.\nThe satellite services business is capital intensive and the build-out of a satellite fleet requires substantial time and investment. Once the investment in a satellite is made, the incremental costs to maintain and operate the satellite are relatively low over the life of the satellite, with the exception of in-orbit insurance. Telesat has been able to generate a large contracted revenue backlog by entering into long-term contracts with some of its customers for all or substantially all of a satellite's life. Historically, this has resulted in revenue from the satellite services business being fairly predictable.\nTelesat's desirable spectrum rights, commitment to providing the highest level of customer service, deep technical expertise and culture of innovation have enabled it to successfully develop its business to date. Leveraging these strengths and building on its existing contractual revenue backlog, Telesat's focus is on profitably growing its business by increasing the utilization of its in-orbit satellites and, in a disciplined manner, deploying expansion satellite capacity where strong market demand is anticipated. Telesat currently has two geostationary satellites, Telstar 18 VANTAGE and Telstar 19 VANTAGE, under construction.\nTelesat believes that it is well positioned to serve its customers and the markets in which it participates. Telesat actively pursues opportunities to develop new satellites, particularly in conjunction with current or prospective customers who will commit to long-term service agreements prior to the time the satellite construction contract is signed. However, while Telesat regularly pursues these opportunities, it does not procure additional or replacement satellites until it believes there is a demonstrated need and a sound business plan for such satellite capacity.\nIn 2018, Telesat remains focused on increasing utilization of its existing satellites, the construction and launch of its new satellites, the development of its global LEO constellation and identifying and pursuing opportunities to invest in expansion satellite capacity, all while maintaining operating discipline.\nOn November 17, 2016, Telesat entered into amended senior secured credit facilities which provide for term loan borrowings of $2.43 billion which mature on November 17, 2023 and revolving credit borrowings of up to $200 million (or Canadian dollar equivalent) which mature on November 17, 2021. Telesat also issued, through a private placement, $500 million of 8.875% senior notes which mature on November 17, 2024.\nOn November 17, 2016, Telesat repaid all outstanding amounts under its former senior secured credit facilities and its 6.0% senior notes.\nOn February 1, 2017, Telesat amended the senior secured credit facilities to effectively reprice the then outstanding term loan borrowings of $2.424 billion.\n 44 \nTelesat's operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate variations. During 2017, approximately 52% of Telesat's revenues, 42% of its operating expenses, 100% of its interest expense and a majority of its capital expenditures were denominated in U.S. dollars. The most significant impact of variations in the exchange rate is on the U.S. dollar denominated indebtedness and cash and short-term investments. As of December 31, 2017, Telesat's U.S. dollar denominated debt totaled $2.9 billion. As of December 31, 2017, a five percent increase (decrease) in the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar would have increased (decreased) Telesat's net income by approximately $129 million. This analysis assumes all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.\nSale of SSL\nOn November 2, 2012, Loral completed the Sale of SSL to MDA. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement dated as of June 26, 2012, as amended on October 30, 2012 and March 28, 2013, by and among Loral, SSL, MDA and MDA Holdings, Loral agreed to indemnify MDA and its affiliates from certain damages in the ViaSat Suit brought in 2012 by ViaSat against Loral and SSL. On September 5, 2014, Loral, SSL and ViaSat entered into the Settlement Agreement pursuant to which the ViaSat Suit and an additional patent infringement and breach of contract lawsuit brought by ViaSat against SSL in September 2013 were settled. Loral was also released by MDA, MDA Holdings and SSL from indemnification claims relating to the ViaSat lawsuits under the Purchase Agreement. The terms of the Settlement Agreement provided, among other things, for payment by Loral and SSL to ViaSat on a joint and several basis of $100 million, $40 million of which was paid in September 2014 in connection with entering into the Settlement Agreement, with the remaining $60 million payable with interest in ten equal quarterly installments of $6.9 million from October 15, 2014 through January 15, 2017.\nFollowing a mediation session held on December 1, 2014, Loral and MDA entered into the Allocation Agreement, pursuant to which Loral and MDA agreed that Loral was responsible for $45 million, and MDA and SSL were responsible for $55 million, of the $100 million litigation settlement with ViaSat. Culminating with the final installment payment of $2.8 million in January 2017, Loral paid a total of $46.1 million, including interest, as its share of the ViaSat settlement (see Note 13 to the financial statements).\nGeneral\nOur principal asset is our majority ownership interest in Telesat. In an effort to maximize shareholder value, we have been exploring, and are in discussions with PSP regarding, potential strategic transactions to alter the status quo in our ownership of Telesat. Subject to market conditions and the cooperation of PSP, we continue to explore the combination of Loral and Telesat into one public company and/or the sale of Loral in connection with a sale of Telesat. Also, as described more fully below, we have exercised our right to require that Telesat initiate a public offering, and we may further pursue this right in the event a combination transaction or a sale of Telesat is not likely to be achievable in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms. There can be no assurance as to whether or when we will be able to conclude any strategic transaction or that any strategic initiatives or transaction involving Telesat or Loral may occur, or that any particular economic, tax, structural or other objectives or benefits with respect to any initiative or transaction involving Telesat or Loral's interest therein will be achieved.\nIn the first quarter of 2017, we received $242.7 million in cash from Telesat, representing our share of an aggregate approximately $400 million distribution from Telesat to its shareholders and stock option holders. We intend to use the proceeds of such distribution, net of reasonable reserves for working capital and other liabilities, to make a distribution to our stockholders. There can be no assurance as to the amount and timing of any such distribution, and such distribution may be impacted by the outcome of our discussions regarding, and the structure of, the strategic combination transaction that we are pursuing.\nAs mentioned above, we have the right under the Telesat Shareholders Agreement to require Telesat to conduct an initial public offering of its equity shares, and, in July 2015, we exercised this right. Specifically, we requested that Telesat issue not more than 25 million newly issued shares of Telesat voting common stock. We also requested the termination of the Shareholders Agreement and the elimination of certain provisions in Telesat's Articles of Incorporation, both of which we believe are important for a successful public offering. If those provisions are eliminated, an impediment to the conversion of our non-voting Telesat shares to voting shares would be eliminated. Termination or modification of the Shareholders Agreement and conversion of our non-voting shares to voting shares would enable us, after a Telesat IPO and subject to the receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, to obtain majority voting control of Telesat. Telesat selected two co-managing underwriters and informed us that it will work to implement a Telesat IPO pending our agreement with PSP on governance matters following a Telesat IPO. To date, no such agreement has been reached. In the event a combination transaction that we are pursuing or a sale of Telesat as described above is not likely to be achievable in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms, we may further pursue our right to a Telesat IPO. There can be no assurance as to whether, when or on what terms a Telesat IPO, termination or modification of the Shareholders Agreement or any requested changes to Telesat's Articles of Incorporation may occur or that any particular economic, tax, structural or other objectives or benefits with respect to a Telesat IPO will be achieved. If a Telesat IPO is expected to proceed under unfavorable terms or at an unfavorable price, we may withdraw our demand for a Telesat IPO.\n 45 \nDepending upon the outcome of the strategic initiatives discussed above, we may assert certain claims against PSP for actions we believe violated our rights relating to the affairs of Telesat under the Telesat Shareholders Agreement and otherwise. In response to our claims, PSP has informed us that it believes that it may have claims against us, although we are not aware of the legal or factual basis for any such claims. We and PSP have agreed that, pending the outcome of our discussions relating to Telesat, it would be beneficial to delay the commencement of any action relating to either party's claims and have entered into an agreement (the Tolling Agreement\u201d) which preserves the parties' rights to assert against one another legal claims relating to Telesat. We also included Telesat as a party to the Tolling Agreement because, as a technical matter of Canadian law and for purposes of potentially seeking equitable relief, Telesat may be a necessary party. There can be no assurance that if the Tolling Agreement lapses that we and PSP will not pursue legal claims against one another relating to Telesat. If we pursue claims against PSP, there can be no assurance that our claims will be successful or that the relief we seek will be granted. If PSP pursues claims against us, there can be no assurance that PSP will not prevail on its claims.\nLoral may, from time to time, explore and evaluate other possible strategic transactions and alliances which may include joint ventures and strategic relationships as well as business combinations or the acquisition or disposition of assets. In order to pursue certain of these opportunities, additional funds are likely to be required. There can be no assurance that we will enter into additional strategic transactions or alliances, nor do we know if we will be able to obtain the necessary financing for transactions that require additional funds on favorable terms, if at all.\nIn connection with the acquisition of our ownership interest in Telesat in 2007, Loral has agreed that, subject to certain exceptions described in the Shareholders Agreement, for so long as Loral has an interest in Telesat, it will not compete in the business of leasing, selling or otherwise furnishing fixed satellite service, broadcast satellite service or audio and video broadcast direct to home service using transponder capacity in the C-band, Ku-band and Ka-band (including in each case extended band) frequencies and the business of providing end-to-end data solutions on networks comprised of earth terminals, space segment, and, where appropriate, networking hubs.\nConsolidated Operating Results\nPlease refer to Critical Accounting Matters set forth below in this section.\nCompared with 2016 and 2016 Compared with 2015\nThe following compares our consolidated results for 2017, 2016 and 2015 as presented in our financial statements:\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to a $0.8 million increase in professional fees and a $0.3 million decrease in pension charges allocated to XTAR.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to $0.8 million of income earned during the year ended December 31, 2015 under the ViaSat-1 revenue share arrangement with Telesat which expired in December 2015 (see Note 14 to the financial statements) and a $0.3 million increase in professional fees, partially offset by pension charges to XTAR of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $0.3 million reduction in accrued expenses and a $0.2 million reduction in consulting charges.\n 46 \nInterest and Investment Income\n\nInterest and investment income for 2017, 2016 and 2015 consists primarily of interest on our cash balance. The increase from 2016 to 2017 was the result of interest income earned on the cash distribution of $242.7 million received from Telesat in the first quarter of 2017.\nOther Expense\n\nOther expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily related to strategic initiatives and settlement and litigation expenses resulting from certain arbitration and legal proceedings with our former Russian joint venture partner. Other expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was primarily comprised of expenses related to the evaluation of strategic initiatives. See Overview - General.\nIncome Tax (Provision) Benefit\n\nFor 2017, we recorded a current tax benefit of $7.1 million and a deferred tax provision of $80.2 million, resulting in a total tax provision of $73.1 million. For 2016, we recorded a current tax benefit of $1.0 million and a deferred tax provision of $29.5 million, resulting in a total tax provision of $28.5 million. For 2015, we recorded a current tax benefit of $5.8 million and a deferred tax benefit of $39.7 million, resulting in a total tax benefit of $45.5 million.\nThe deferred tax (provision) benefit for each period included the impact of equity in net income (loss) of affiliates in our consolidated statement of operations.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S tax code, such as the imposition of a one-time transition tax in 2017 on certain unrepatriated earnings of controlled foreign corporations, including Telesat, and numerous changes first effective in 2018 including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) eliminating U.S federal income taxes on dividends from certain foreign investments, such as Telesat; (3) requiring a current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations, including Telesat; (4) limiting the use of FTCs to reduce U.S. federal tax liability; (5) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax ( AMT\u201d) and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized; (6) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax, a new minimum tax; (7) creating a new limit on deductible interest expense; and (8) changing the rules related to the use of NOL carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. We recognized the income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implication of the Tax Cuts and Job Act (SAB 118), in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. SAB 118 provides guidance for the application of income tax accounting standards related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Based upon our analysis, as of December 31, 2017, we reduced deferred tax assets by $33.2 million related to the tax rate reduction with a corresponding increase to our deferred income tax provision and increased non-current income taxes receivable by $1.6 million related to refundable AMT credits with a corresponding reduction to deferred tax assets. The preliminary effect recorded may change in the future due to revisions in the interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or legislative action to clarify interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company expects to finalize the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with the filing of its 2017 tax return and record in the fourth quarter of 2018 any difference between the final effect and the provisional effect recorded.\n 47 \nThe current tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 included our anticipated income tax liability related to the cash distribution received from Telesat after use of AMT credits and NOL carryforwards and FTCs from Telesat. Upon receiving the cash distribution from Telesat in the first quarter of 2017, we recorded a current tax liability of $53.0 million. During 2017, we made tax payments of $12.5 million, primarily with respect to the distribution, and commenced a tax study to determine the allowable amount of FTCs that could be utilized to minimize our cash tax liability. After completing our analysis in the fourth quarter of 2017, we reduced our current tax liability to approximately $2.0 million and established a deferred tax asset of $104.9 million for the carryforward of unused FTCs. Since, at the current time, sufficient positive evidence does not exist to support full recovery of the FTC carryforward, we recorded a full valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset during the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had no income taxes payable and a current income tax receivable of $11.1 million, primarily related to recovery of tax payments previously made on the cash distribution.\nFor each period presented, the statute of limitations for the assessment of additional tax expired with regard to several of our federal and state uncertain tax positions ( UTPs\u201d) and certain other UTPs were settled. As a result, the reduction to our liability for UTPs provided a current tax benefit including the reversal of previously recognized interest and penalties, partially offset by an additional provision for the potential payment of interest on our remaining UTPs.\nSubsequent to the Sale, to the extent that profitability from operations is not sufficient to realize the benefit from our remaining net deferred tax assets, we would generate sufficient taxable income from the appreciated value of our Telesat investment in order to prevent federal net operating losses from expiring and realize the benefit of all remaining deferred tax assets.\nSee Critical Accounting Matters - Taxation below for discussion of our accounting method for income taxes.\nEquity in Net Income (Loss) of Affiliates\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of the changes in our investment in Telesat for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, we held a 62.7% economic interest and a 32.7% voting interest in Telesat. Loral's equity in net income of Telesat is based on our proportionate share of Telesat's results in accordance with U.S. GAAP and in U.S. dollars. The amortization of Telesat fair value adjustments applicable to the Loral Skynet assets and liabilities acquired by Telesat in 2007 is proportionately eliminated in determining our share of the net income or loss of Telesat. Our equity in net income or loss of Telesat also reflects amortization of profits eliminated, to the extent of our economic interest in Telesat, on satellites we constructed for Telesat while we owned SSL and on Loral's sale to Telesat in April 2011 of its portion of the payload on the ViaSat-1 satellite and related assets.\n 48 \nAs of December 31, 2015, we had an unrecorded equity loss in Telesat of $57.9 million, the amount by which our share of Telesat's losses together with cash distributions we received from Telesat exceeded our recorded cumulative equity in net income of Telesat and our initial investment in Telesat. In following the equity method of accounting, our investment balance in Telesat was reduced to zero as of December 31, 2015. In addition, our equity in Telesat's other comprehensive income that we could not record as of December 31, 2015 was $20.8 million. We recognized this $57.9 million equity loss and our $20.8 million share in the equity of Telesat's other comprehensive income in 2016.\nSummary financial information for Telesat in accordance with U.S. GAAP in Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 follows (in thousands):\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Leveraging these strengths and building on its existing contractual revenue backlog, Telesat's focus is on profitably growing its business by increasing the utilization of its in-orbit satellites and, in a disciplined manner, deploying expansion satellite capacity where strong market demand is anticipated. Telesat currently has two geostationary satellites, Telstar 18 VANTAGE and Telstar 19 VANTAGE, under construction.\nTelesat believes that it is well positioned to serve its customers and the markets in which it participates. Telesat actively pursues opportunities to develop new satellites, particularly in conjunction with current or prospective customers who will commit to long-term service agreements prior to the time the satellite construction contract is signed. However, while Telesat regularly pursues these opportunities, it does not procure additional or replacement satellites until it believes there is a demonstrated need and a sound business plan for such satellite capacity.\nIn 2018, Telesat remains focused on increasing utilization of its existing satellites, the construction and launch of its new satellites, the development of its global LEO constellation and identifying and pursuing opportunities to invest in expansion satellite capacity, all while maintaining operating discipline.\nOn November 17, 2016, Telesat entered into amended senior secured credit facilities which provide for term loan borrowings of $2.43 billion which mature on November 17, 2023 and revolving credit borrowings of up to $200 million (or Canadian dollar equivalent) which mature on November 17, 2021. Telesat also issued, through a private placement, $500 million of 8.875% senior notes which mature on November 17, 2024.\nOn November 17, 2016, Telesat repaid all outstanding amounts under its former senior secured credit facilities and its 6.0% senior notes.\nOn February 1, 2017, Telesat amended the senior secured credit facilities to effectively reprice the then outstanding term loan borrowings of $2.424 billion.\n 44 \nTelesat's operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate variations. During 2017, approximately 52% of Telesat's revenues, 42% of its operating expenses, 100% of its interest expense and a majority of its capital expenditures were denominated in U.S. dollars. The most significant impact of variations in the exchange rate is on the U.S. dollar denominated indebtedness and cash and short-term investments. As of December 31, 2017, Telesat's U.S. dollar denominated debt totaled $2.9 billion. As of December 31, 2017, a five percent increase (decrease) in the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar would have increased (decreased) Telesat's net income by approximately $129 million. This analysis assumes all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.\nSale of SSL\nOn November 2, 2012, Loral completed the Sale of SSL to MDA. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement dated as of June 26, 2012, as amended on October 30, 2012 and March 28, 2013, by and among Loral, SSL, MDA and MDA Holdings, Loral agreed to indemnify MDA and its affiliates from certain damages in the ViaSat Suit brought in 2012 by ViaSat against Loral and SSL. On September 5, 2014, Loral, SSL and ViaSat entered into the Settlement Agreement pursuant to which the ViaSat Suit and an additional patent infringement and breach of contract lawsuit brought by ViaSat against SSL in September 2013 were settled. Loral was also released by MDA, MDA Holdings and SSL from indemnification claims relating to the ViaSat lawsuits under the Purchase Agreement. The terms of the Settlement Agreement provided, among other things, for payment by Loral and SSL to ViaSat on a joint and several basis of $100 million, $40 million of which was paid in September 2014 in connection with entering into the Settlement Agreement, with the remaining $60 million payable with interest in ten equal quarterly installments of $6.9 million from October 15, 2014 through January 15, 2017.\nFollowing a mediation session held on December 1, 2014, Loral and MDA entered into the Allocation Agreement, pursuant to which Loral and MDA agreed that Loral was responsible for $45 million, and MDA and SSL were responsible for $55 million, of the $100 million litigation settlement with ViaSat. Culminating with the final installment payment of $2.8 million in January 2017, Loral paid a total of $46.1 million, including interest, as its share of the ViaSat settlement (see Note 13 to the financial statements).\nGeneral\nOur principal asset is our majority ownership interest in Telesat. In an effort to maximize shareholder value, we have been exploring, and are in discussions with PSP regarding, potential strategic transactions to alter the status quo in our ownership of Telesat. Subject to market conditions and the cooperation of PSP, we continue to explore the combination of Loral and Telesat into one public company and/or the sale of Loral in connection with a sale of Telesat. Also, as described more fully below, we have exercised our right to require that Telesat initiate a public offering, and we may further pursue this right in the event a combination transaction or a sale of Telesat is not likely to be achievable in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms. There can be no assurance as to whether or when we will be able to conclude any strategic transaction or that any strategic initiatives or transaction involving Telesat or Loral may occur, or that any particular economic, tax, structural or other objectives or benefits with respect to any initiative or transaction involving Telesat or Loral's interest therein will be achieved.\nIn the first quarter of 2017, we received $242.7 million in cash from Telesat, representing our share of an aggregate approximately $400 million distribution from Telesat to its shareholders and stock option holders. We intend to use the proceeds of such distribution, net of reasonable reserves for working capital and other liabilities, to make a distribution to our stockholders. There can be no assurance as to the amount and timing of any such distribution, and such distribution may be impacted by the outcome of our discussions regarding, and the structure of, the strategic combination transaction that we are pursuing.\nAs mentioned above, we have the right under the Telesat Shareholders Agreement to require Telesat to conduct an initial public offering of its equity shares, and, in July 2015, we exercised this right. Specifically, we requested that Telesat issue not more than 25 million newly issued shares of Telesat voting common stock. We also requested the termination of the Shareholders Agreement and the elimination of certain provisions in Telesat's Articles of Incorporation, both of which we believe are important for a successful public offering. If those provisions are eliminated, an impediment to the conversion of our non-voting Telesat shares to voting shares would be eliminated. Termination or modification of the Shareholders Agreement and conversion of our non-voting shares to voting shares would enable us, after a Telesat IPO and subject to the receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, to obtain majority voting control of Telesat. Telesat selected two co-managing underwriters and informed us that it will work to implement a Telesat IPO pending our agreement with PSP on governance matters following a Telesat IPO. To date, no such agreement has been reached. In the event a combination transaction that we are pursuing or a sale of Telesat as described above is not likely to be achievable in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms, we may further pursue our right to a Telesat IPO. There can be no assurance as to whether, when or on what terms a Telesat IPO, termination or modification of the Shareholders Agreement or any requested changes to Telesat's Articles of Incorporation may occur or that any particular economic, tax, structural or other objectives or benefits with respect to a Telesat IPO will be achieved. If a Telesat IPO is expected to proceed under unfavorable terms or at an unfavorable price, we may withdraw our demand for a Telesat IPO.\n 45 \nDepending upon the outcome of the strategic initiatives discussed above, we may assert certain claims against PSP for actions we believe violated our rights relating to the affairs of Telesat under the Telesat Shareholders Agreement and otherwise. In response to our claims, PSP has informed us that it believes that it may have claims against us, although we are not aware of the legal or factual basis for any such claims. We and PSP have agreed that, pending the outcome of our discussions relating to Telesat, it would be beneficial to delay the commencement of any action relating to either party's claims and have entered into an agreement (the Tolling Agreement\u201d) which preserves the parties' rights to assert against one another legal claims relating to Telesat. We also included Telesat as a party to the Tolling Agreement because, as a technical matter of Canadian law and for purposes of potentially seeking equitable relief, Telesat may be a necessary party. There can be no assurance that if the Tolling Agreement lapses that we and PSP will not pursue legal claims against one another relating to Telesat. If we pursue claims against PSP, there can be no assurance that our claims will be successful or that the relief we seek will be granted. If PSP pursues claims against us, there can be no assurance that PSP will not prevail on its claims.\nLoral may, from time to time, explore and evaluate other possible strategic transactions and alliances which may include joint ventures and strategic relationships as well as business combinations or the acquisition or disposition of assets. In order to pursue certain of these opportunities, additional funds are likely to be required. There can be no assurance that we will enter into additional strategic transactions or alliances, nor do we know if we will be able to obtain the necessary financing for transactions that require additional funds on favorable terms, if at all.\nIn connection with the acquisition of our ownership interest in Telesat in 2007, Loral has agreed that, subject to certain exceptions described in the Shareholders Agreement, for so long as Loral has an interest in Telesat, it will not compete in the business of leasing, selling or otherwise furnishing fixed satellite service, broadcast satellite service or audio and video broadcast direct to home service using transponder capacity in the C-band, Ku-band and Ka-band (including in each case extended band) frequencies and the business of providing end-to-end data solutions on networks comprised of earth terminals, space segment, and, where appropriate, networking hubs.\nConsolidated Operating Results\nPlease refer to Critical Accounting Matters set forth below in this section.\nCompared with 2016 and 2016 Compared with 2015\nThe following compares our consolidated results for 2017, 2016 and 2015 as presented in our financial statements:\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,935 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,530 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to a $0.8 million increase in professional fees and a $0.3 million decrease in pension charges allocated to XTAR.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to $0.8 million of income earned during the year ended December 31, 2015 under the ViaSat-1 revenue share arrangement with Telesat which expired in December 2015 (see Note 14 to the financial statements) and a $0.3 million increase in professional fees, partially offset by pension charges to XTAR of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $0.3 million reduction in accrued expenses and a $0.2 million reduction in consulting charges.\n 46 \nInterest and Investment Income\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest and investment income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest and investment income for 2017, 2016 and 2015 consists primarily of interest on our cash balance.

Other expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was primarily comprised of expenses related to the evaluation of strategic initiatives.

For 2016, we recorded a current tax benefit of $1.0 million and a deferred tax provision of $29.5 million, resulting in a total tax provision of $28.5 million. For 2015, we recorded a current tax benefit of $5.8 million and a deferred tax benefit of $39.7 million, resulting in a total tax benefit of $45.5 million.\nThe deferred tax (provision) benefit for each period included the impact of equity in net income (loss) of affiliates in our consolidated statement of operations.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S tax code, such as the imposition of a one-time transition tax in 2017 on certain unrepatriated earnings of controlled foreign corporations, including Telesat, and numerous changes first effective in 2018 including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) eliminating U.S federal income taxes on dividends from certain foreign investments, such as Telesat; (3) requiring a current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations, including Telesat; (4) limiting the use of FTCs to reduce U.S. federal tax liability; (5) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax ( AMT\u201d) and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized; (6) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax, a new minimum tax; (7) creating a new limit on deductible interest expense; and (8) changing the rules related to the use of NOL carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. We recognized the income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implication of the Tax Cuts and Job Act (SAB 118), in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. SAB 118 provides guidance for the application of income tax accounting standards related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Based upon our analysis, as of December 31, 2017, we reduced deferred tax assets by $33.2 million related to the tax rate reduction with a corresponding increase to our deferred income tax provision and increased non-current income taxes receivable by $1.6 million related to refundable AMT credits with a corresponding reduction to deferred tax assets. The preliminary effect recorded may change in the future due to revisions in the interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or legislative action to clarify interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company expects to finalize the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with the filing of its 2017 tax return and record in the fourth quarter of 2018 any difference between the final effect and the provisional effect recorded.\n 47 \nThe current tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 included our anticipated income tax liability related to the cash distribution received from Telesat after use of AMT credits and NOL carryforwards and FTCs from Telesat. Upon receiving the cash distribution from Telesat in the first quarter of 2017, we recorded a current tax liability of $53.0 million. During 2017, we made tax payments of $12.5 million, primarily with respect to the distribution, and commenced a tax study to determine the allowable amount of FTCs that could be utilized to minimize our cash tax liability. After completing our analysis in the fourth quarter of 2017, we reduced our current tax liability to approximately $2.0 million and established a deferred tax asset of $104.9 million for the carryforward of unused FTCs. Since, at the current time, sufficient positive evidence does not exist to support full recovery of the FTC carryforward, we recorded a full valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset during the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had no income taxes payable and a current income tax receivable of $11.1 million, primarily related to recovery of tax payments previously made on the cash distribution.\nFor each period presented, the statute of limitations for the assessment of additional tax expired with regard to several of our federal and state uncertain tax positions ( UTPs\u201d) and certain other UTPs were settled. As a result, the reduction to our liability for UTPs provided a current tax benefit including the reversal of previously recognized interest and penalties, partially offset by an additional provision for the potential payment of interest on our remaining UTPs.\nSubsequent to the Sale, to the extent that profitability from operations is not sufficient to realize the benefit from our remaining net deferred tax assets, we would generate sufficient taxable income from the appreciated value of our Telesat investment in order to prevent federal net operating losses from expiring and realize the benefit of all remaining deferred tax assets.\nSee Critical Accounting Matters - Taxation below for discussion of our accounting method for income taxes.\nEquity in Net Income (Loss) of Affiliates\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Telesat </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>216,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(74,329 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>XTAR </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30,463 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>216,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(104,792 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following is a reconciliation of the changes in our investment in Telesat for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Opening Balance, January 1, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>107,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Less: Cash distribution received </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(242,735 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Components of equity in net income of Telesat: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Equity in net income of Telesat </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>212,001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>140,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Eliminations of affiliate transactions and related amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,346 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Recognition of equity loss suspended as of prior year-end </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>216,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(57,924 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84,078 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Components of equity in other comprehensive income of Telesat: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Equity in other comprehensive (loss) income of Telesat </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28,132 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Recognition of equity in other comprehensive income suspended as of prior year-end </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28,132 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,872 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Ending balance, December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,430 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>107,950 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2016, we held a 62.7% economic interest and a 32.7% voting interest in Telesat. Loral's equity in net income of Telesat is based on our proportionate share of Telesat's results in accordance with U.S. GAAP and in U.S. dollars. The amortization of Telesat fair value adjustments applicable to the Loral Skynet assets and liabilities acquired by Telesat in 2007 is proportionately eliminated in determining our share of the net income or loss of Telesat. Our equity in net income or loss of Telesat also reflects amortization of profits eliminated, to the extent of our economic interest in Telesat, on satellites we constructed for Telesat while we owned SSL and on Loral's sale to Telesat in April 2011 of its portion of the payload on the ViaSat-1 satellite and related assets.\n 48 \nAs of December 31, 2015, we had an unrecorded equity loss in Telesat of $57.9 million, the amount by which our share of Telesat's losses together with cash distributions we received from Telesat exceeded our recorded cumulative equity in net income of Telesat and our initial investment in Telesat. In following the equity method of accounting, our investment balance in Telesat was reduced to zero as of December 31, 2015. In addition, our equity in Telesat's other comprehensive income that we could not record as of December 31, 2015 was $20.8 million. We recognized this $57.9 million equity loss and our $20.8 million share in the equity of Telesat's other comprehensive income in 2016.\nSummary financial information for Telesat in accordance with U.S. GAAP in Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 follows (in thousands):\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In Canadian dollars) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In U.S. dollars) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Statement of Operations Data: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>927,771 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>931,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>954,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>712,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>703,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>751,684 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(196,486 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(184,254 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(178,607 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(150,872 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(139,141 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(140,706 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(252,917 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(259,258 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(242,430 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(194,203 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(195,781 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(190,985 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Insurance proceeds </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on"}
