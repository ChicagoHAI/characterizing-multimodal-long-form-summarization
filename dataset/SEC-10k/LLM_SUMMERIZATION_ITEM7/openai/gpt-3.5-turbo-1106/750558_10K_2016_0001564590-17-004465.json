MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nResults of Operations - Overview\nQNB Corp. ( QNB\u201d or the Company\u201d) earns its net income primarily through its subsidiary, QNB Bank (the Bank\u201d). Net interest income, or the spread between the interest, dividends and fees earned on loans and investment securities and the expense incurred on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, is the primary source of operating income for QNB. QNB seeks to achieve sustainable and consistent earnings growth while maintaining adequate levels of capital and liquidity and limiting its exposure to credit and interest rate risk levels approved by the Board of Directors. Due to its limited geographic area, comprised principally of Bucks, Lehigh and Montgomery counties, growth is pursued through expansion of existing customer relationships and building new relationships by stressing a consistent high level of service at all points of contact.\nTabular information presented throughout management's discussion and analysis, other than share and per share data, is presented in thousands of dollars.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $8,924,000, or $2.63 per share on a diluted basis. This compares to 2015 net income of $8,233,000, or $2.46 per share on a diluted basis and 2014 net income of $8,998,000, or $2.72 per share on a diluted basis. Two important measures of profitability in the banking industry are an institution's return on average assets and return on average shareholders' equity. Return on average assets was 0.87%, 0.83% and 0.95% in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and return on average shareholders' equity was 9.45%, 9.29% and 10.89%, respectively, during those same periods.\n2016 versus 2015\nThe results for 2016 include the following significant components:\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Net interest income increased $1,135,000, or 4.1%, to $28,504,000 for 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis decreased two basis points to 3.03% for 2016 from 3.05% for 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Provision for loan losses totaled $30,000 for 2016, compared with $200,000 for 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Non-interest income for 2016 was $5,667,000, a decrease of $365,000, or 6.1%, compared with 2015.

Net interest income is interest income, dividends, and fees on earning assets, less interest expense incurred for funding sources. Earning assets primarily include loans, investment securities and interest bearing balances at the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed). Sources used to fund these assets include deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates, the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the amount of earning assets funded by non-interest bearing deposits.\nFor purposes of this discussion, interest income and the average yield earned on loans and investment securities are adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis as detailed in the table that appears above. This adjustment to interest income is made for analysis purposes only. Interest income is increased by the amount of savings of Federal income taxes, which QNB realizes by investing in certain tax-exempt state and municipal securities and by making loans to certain tax-exempt organizations. In this way, the ultimate economic impact of earnings from various assets can be more easily compared.\nThe net interest rate spread is the difference between average rates received on earning assets and average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, while the net interest margin, which includes interest-free sources of funds, is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The Asset/Liability and Investment Management Committee works to manage and maximize the net interest margin for the Company.\n2016 versus 2015\nOn a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2016 increased $991,000, or 3.4%, to $30,145,000. The net interest margin, which declined to 3.03% was negatively impacted by declining yields on earning assets resulting from the prolonged low interest rate environment. The average rate earned on earning assets declined three basis points from 3.53% for 2015 to 3.50% for 2016 with the yield on loans declining by five basis points while the yield on investment securities remained steady at 2.42%. In comparison, the interest rate paid on total average interest-bearing liabilities increased by one basis point from 0.56% for 2015 to 0.57% for 2016 with the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increasing from 0.57% to 0.58% for the same time period, respectively.\nNet interest income and net interest margin continue to be negatively impacted by declining yields on earning assets resulting from the prolonged low interest rate environment that banks have been operating in since 2008. At the beginning of this low interest rate cycle, funding costs declined at a faster pace and to a greater degree than rates on earning assets, resulting in an increasing net interest margin. However, this trend has reversed as funding costs have approached bottom while yields on earning assets continue to reprice lower, resulting in a decline in the net interest margin, despite two Federal Funds rate increases of 25 basis points each in December 2015 and 2016. The competitive local interest rate market for quality loans has also negatively impacted net interest income and net interest margin. Partially offsetting the impact of declining yields on earning assets was growth in earning assets, primarily loans. Average earning assets increased by $41,265,000, or 4.3%, to $995,846,000 for 2016, with average loans increasing $30,701,000, or 5.3%, to $605,040,000, while average investment securities increased $4,337,000, or 1.2%, to $359,310,000. However, with the growth in earning assets occurring primarily in the loan portfolio, the mix of earning assets changed, which also contributed to relative stability of the net interest margin, as investment securities generally earn a lower yield than loans. The growth in earning assets was also funded by a $28,740,000, or 3.3%, increase in average total deposits to $892,541,000, and the increase in short-term borrowing, primarily sweep accounts structured as repurchase agreements with our commercial customers, of $8,289,000, or 26.0%.\n2015 versus 2014\nOn a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2015 increased $1,125,000, or 4.0%, to $29,154,000, with net interest margin declining two basis points, for the reasons detailed in the discussion above. The average rate earned on earning assets declined four basis points from 3.57% for 2014 to 3.53% for 2015, with the yield on loans declining by eleven basis points while the yield on investment securities decreased five basis points. In comparison, the interest rate paid on total average interest-bearing liabilities declined two basis points from 0.58% for 2014 to 0.56% for 2015, with the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits declining from 0.58% to 0.57% over the same time period.\n- 20 -\nAverage Balances, Rates, and Interest Income and Expense Summary (Tax-Equivalent Basis)\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

Total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis increased $1,218,000 to $34,878,000 for 2016, while total interest expense increased $227,000 to $4,733,000. Volume growth in earning assets contributed an additional $1,411,000 of interest income which was offset in part by a decline in interest income of $193,000 resulting from lower interest rates. With regard to interest expense, rate-related interest expense increased $204,000, while volume-related interest expense increased $23,000.\nInvestments\n2016 versus 2015\nInterest income on trading, available-for-sale, and held-to-maturity investment securities increased $104,000 when comparing the two years. The increase in average balances contributed to $35,000 of the increase, while better rates contributed the remaining $69,000 increase. The average yield on the investment portfolio was 2.42% for both 2015 and 2016. The increase in the investment portfolio is\n- 22 -\ndue to investment opportunities at a yield comparable to the overall portfolio yield in late 2016 compared with previous periods, as well as continuing increase in deposits.\nIncome on U.S. Government agency securities increased $276,000, due to an increase in average balances totaling $8,804,000. The yield on the portfolio increased by 21 basis points from 1.62% for 2015 to 1.83% for 2016, as investments in this sector had better yields than previously available. Most of the bonds in the agency portfolio have call features ranging from three months to three years, many of which were exercised as a result of the low interest rate environment.\nInterest income on tax-exempt municipal securities decreased $89,000. Average balances, which declined $361,000, contributed $15,000 to the decrease in interest income and the ten basis point decline in yield from 4.14% in 2015 to 4.04% in 2016 contributed the remaining $74,000 reduction in interest income. QNB had purchased many municipal securities when rates were significantly higher. Many of these bonds have either reached maturity or their call dates and are being replaced with municipal bonds with lower yields. Typically, QNB purchased municipal bonds with 10-15 year maturities The yield on this portfolio is expected to continue to decline as there are $24,572,000 in municipal bonds with a tax-equivalent yield of 6.08% that are expected to be called or mature in 2017. The current yield on replacement bonds is well below this threshold.\nAll the mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMO\u201d) securities owned by QNB are issued by U.S. Government agencies and sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and carry the implicit backing of the U.S. Government, but they are not direct obligations of the U.S. Government. Interest income on mortgage-backed securities and CMOs decreased $93,000 primarily due to a decrease of $5,270,000, or 2.5% in average balances The yield on the mortgage-backed and CMO portfolio improved by one basis point from 1.97% for 2015 to 1.98% for 2016. The historically low interest rate environment resulted in significant mortgage refinancing activity over the past several years, resulting in an increase in prepayments on these securities. Since many of these securities were purchased at a premium, prepayments result in a shorter amortization period of this premium and therefore a reduction in income.\n2015 versus 2014\nInterest income on trading, available-for-sale, and held-to-maturity investment securities decreased $489,000 when comparing the two years. The $12,295,000 decrease in average balances contributed to $288,000 of the decrease, while falling rates contributed the remaining $201,000 decline. The average yield on the investment portfolio decreased five basis points from 2.47% for 2014 to 2.42% for 2015. The decrease in the investment portfolio is due to lower yielding investment opportunities in 2015 compared with previous periods, as well as higher demand for loans.\nIncome on U.S. Government agency securities decreased $65,000, due to a decline in average balances, even as the yield on the portfolio increased by ten basis points to 1.62% in 2015.\nInterest income on tax-exempt municipal securities decreased $324,000. Average balances, which declined $3,671,000, or 4.8%, contributed $160,000 to the decrease in interest income and the 22 basis point decline in yield from 4.36% in 2014 to 4.14% in 2015 contributed the remaining $164,000 reduction in interest income.\nInterest income on mortgage-backed securities and CMOs decreased $178,000 with a small decrease in average balances as well as lower rates contributing to the decline. Average balances decreased $2,787,000, or 1.3%, to $207,549,000 when comparing the two years, resulting in a $56,000 decline in interest income. The yield on the mortgage-backed and CMO portfolio decreased six basis points from 2.03% for 2014 to 1.97% for 2015, resulting in a $122,000 reduction in interest income.\nLoans\n2016 versus 2015\nThe largest category of the loan portfolio is commercial real estate loans. This category of loans includes commercial purpose loans secured by either commercial properties such as office buildings, factories, warehouses, medical facilities and retail establishments, or residential real estate, usually the residence of the business owner or investment properties. The category also includes construction and land development loans. Income on commercial real estate loans increased $1,403,000. The increase in average balances of $37,386,000, or 12.6%, contributed an increase in interest income of $1,686,000. This was offset in part by an eight basis point decline in yield, from 4.51% in 2015 to 4.43% in 2016, which resulted in a decrease of interest income of $283,000.\nIncome on commercial and industrial loans, the second largest category, decreased $312,000 with the positive impact from an increase in yield offset by a decrease in average balances. Average commercial and industrial loans decreased $10,904,000, or 8.9%, to $111,390,000 for 2016, resulting in a $451,000 decrease in interest income. Average yield on these loans increased 12 basis points to 4.26% providing an additional $139,000 in interest income.\n- 23 -\nTax-exempt loan income decreased $290,000 from 2015. When comparing the same periods, average balances decreased $5,311,000 to $38,638,000, which contributed a $212,000 decrease in interest income. With the decline in market interest rates QNB has renegotiated and rebid on many loans to municipalities over the past several years. As a result, the average yield on the tax-exempt loan portfolio has declined from 4.00% for 2015 to 3.80% for 2016, resulting in decreased interest income of $78,000.\nIndirect lease financing receivables represent loans to small businesses that are collateralized by equipment. These loans tend to have higher risk characteristics, but generally provide higher rates of return. In October 2016, the Company sold its interest in these third-party originated finance contracts, recording a loss on sale of $223,000, which was essentially offset by a $220,000 reversal of the allowance for loan losses associated with this portfolio. The third party who had originated the leases and acted as primary servicer of the portfolio had recently sold his company and QNB did not have staff with the expertise needed to continue to service this portfolio, nor the ability to effectively repossess and resell equipment in case of borrower default. Therefore, based on management's recommendation, QNB's Board of Directors approved the sale of this portfolio in its entirety.\nQNB strives to become the local consumer lender of choice\u201d, and to affect this QNB has refocused its retail lending efforts by strengthening the management of the area, adding new product offerings and by increasing marketing and promotion. The positive impact of this renewed focus has been year-over-year growth in balances in all three categories of retail lending: residential mortgage, home equity and consumer loans. Overall, interest income for retail lending increased $387,000 in 2016 compared with 2015, driven by the increase in average balances.\nIncome on home equity loans increased by $217,000 when comparing 2016 and 2015. During 2016 QNB offered attractive rates on both variable rate and fixed rate home equity loans, which contributed to an increase in average balances totaling $4,360,000, or 7.4%, to $63,439,000 when comparing 2016 and 2015. The yield on the home equity portfolio increased nine basis points to 3.68% when comparing the two years. The demand for home equity loans has improved along with the recovery in home values. We expect that the demand for home equity loans will continue.\nGiven the low yields on alternative investment securities, QNB retained certain hybrid adjustable rate mortgages to borrowers with high credit scores and low loan-to-value ratios. As a result, average residential mortgage loans secured by first lien 1-4 family residential mortgages increased by $5,658,000, or 14.3%, to $45,233,000 for 2016. The average yield on the residential real estate portfolio decreased by 20 basis points to 3.89% for 2016. Overall, interest income for this segment grew $141,000 in 2016.\nInterest income on consumer loans increased $29,000. As with all other categories of retail loans, consumer loans at QNB experienced growth in average balances in 2016, with balances in this segment increasing $679,000. This growth in volume contributed $37,000 to the increase in income, while decline in yield from 5.37% in 2015 to 5.20% offset the volume increase by $8,000.\n2015 versus 2014\nIncome on commercial real estate loans increased $1,280,000. The increase in average balances of $30,760,000, or 11.6%, contributed an increase in interest income of $1,400,000. This was offset in part by a 4 basis point decline in yield, from 4.55% in 2014 to 4.51% in 2015, which resulted in a decrease of interest income of $120,000.\nIncome on commercial and industrial loans increased $140,000 with the positive impact from growth in balances offsetting the decline in yield. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $9,139,000, or 8.1%, to $122,294,000 for 2015, providing an additional $398,000 in interest income. Average yield on these loans decreased 21 basis points to 4.14%, resulting in a decrease in interest income of $258,000.\nTax-exempt loan income decreased $76,000 from 2014. When comparing the same periods, average balances increased $389,000 to $43,949,000, which contributed a $17,000 increase in interest income. The average yield on the tax-exempt loan portfolio declined from 4.21% for 2014 to 4.00% for 2015, resulting in decreased interest income of $93,000.\nIndirect lease financing income was $818,000 for 2015, an increase of $44,000 when compared with the $774,000 reported for 2014. Average balances increased by $1,357,000, or 17.4%, resulting in $135,000 increase in income when comparing the two years. The yield on the portfolio decreased 100 basis points to 8.95% in 2015, offsetting the volume-related increase in income by $91,000.\nInterest income for retail lending increased $183,000 in 2015 compared with 2014, driven by the increase in average balances. Income on home equity loans declined by $5,000 when comparing 2015 and 2014. Home equity loan average balances increased $2,830,000, or 5.0%, to $59,079,000 when comparing 2015 and 2014. The yield on the home equity portfolio, however, decreased 19 basis points to 3.59% when comparing the two years.\n- 24 -\nAverage residential mortgage loans secured by first lien 1-4 family residential mortgages increased by $5,452,000, or 16.0%, to $39,575,000 for 2015. The average yield on the residential real estate portfolio decreased by twelve basis points to 4.09% for 2015. Overall, interest income for this segment grew $182,000 in 2015.\nInterest income on consumer loans increased $6,000. Balances in this segment increased $285,000. This growth contributed $15,000 to the increase in income, while a decline in yield from 5.60% in 2014 to 5.37% offset the volume increase by $9,000.\nDeposits and Borrowings\n2016 versus 2015\nEarning assets are funded primarily by deposits, which increased on average by $28,740,000, or 3.3%, to $892,541,000, when comparing 2016 and 2015. Total interest expense for 2016 was $4,733,000 compared with $4,506,000 for 2015, an increase of $227,000. Interest expense on total deposits increased $190,000 and interest expense on borrowed funds increased $37,000 when comparing the two years. The rate paid on both interest-bearing deposits and interest-bearing liabilities increased one basis point, when comparing the two periods. Deposit and borrowing yields are expected to increase as short-term interest rates begin to rise and the competition for deposits increases.\nConsistent with the past several years, the growth in deposits during 2016 was centered in accounts with greater liquidity, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand, money market accounts, and savings deposits. Average non-interest-bearing demand accounts increased $11,433,000, or 11.9%, to $107,579,000 for 2016. QNB has been very successful in increasing business checking accounts as average balances in these accounts have increased by $10,336,000, or 13.5%, when comparing the two years. Average interest-bearing demand accounts increased $19,256,000, or 14.3%, to $153,598,000 for 2016 compared with 2015, with interest expense on interest-bearing demand accounts increasing $26,000 to $315,000 for 2016. The average rate paid remained unchanged at 0.21% for 2015 and 2016. Included in this category is QNB-Rewards checking, a higher-rate checking account product. The rate paid on balances up to $25,000 was 1.00% and 0.25% for balances over $25,000 in 2016. In order to receive the high rate a customer must receive an electronic statement, have one direct deposit or other ACH transaction and have at least 12 check card purchase transactions post and clear per statement cycle. If these qualifications are not met the rate paid for 2016 was 0.15%. For 2016, the average balance in this product was $44,918,000 and the related interest expense was $249,000 for an average cost of funds of 0.56%. In comparison, the average balance of the QNB-Rewards accounts for 2015 was $39,967,000 yielding 0.58%. The rates paid on the QNB-Rewards product, assuming qualifications are met, is still attractive relative to competitors' offerings as well as other QNB products. This product also generates fee income through the use of the check card. The average balance of other interest-bearing demand accounts included in this category increased from $94,375,000 for 2015 to $108,680,000 for 2016. The average rate paid on these balances was 0.06% for both years.\nAverage money market accounts increased $5,843,000, or 8.9%, to $71,256,000 for 2016 compared with 2015. The increase in money market balances is a result of a shift in balances to more liquid accounts. Interest expense on money market accounts increased $34,000 to $192,000 for 2016 compared with 2015. The average interest rate paid on money market accounts was 0.27% for 2016, an increase of three basis points compared with 2015. The balances in this category primarily comprise Select money market accounts, a product that pays a tiered rate based on account balances. With the continuation of low short-term interest rates, balances remaining in these accounts for 2016 were at higher-yielding tiers.\nInterest expense on municipal interest-bearing demand accounts decreased $38,000 to $351,000 for 2016. The average balance of municipal interest-bearing demand accounts decreased $13,915,000, or 12.0%, to $102,060,000, while the average interest rate paid on these accounts was 0.34% for both 2016 and 2015. Most of these accounts are indexed to the Federal funds rate with negotiated rate floors between 0.25% and 0.50%. Many of these deposits are seasonal in nature and are received during the third quarter as tax receipts are collected and are withdrawn over the course of the next year.\nDuring the second quarter of 2009, QNB introduced an online eSavings account to compete with other online savings accounts. This product was introduced at a yield of 1.85% and has been successful, with average balances growing $7,579,000, or 4.7%, to $168,360,000 in 2016 compared with $160,781,000 in 2015. The rate on this product was 0.50% during 2015 and was changed to 0.55% in late December 2016. The average cost of funds on these accounts was 0.46% for 2015 and 0.50% for 2016. The yield on this account may rise along with market rates and as competition for savings balances increases. Traditional statement savings accounts and club accounts are also included in the savings category and increased on average by $4,639,000, or 8.2%, to $61,419,000. The average rate paid on total savings accounts was 0.40% for 2016, a three basis point increase from 2015 while interest expense increased $117,000, from $806,000 to $923,000 over the same period. The growth in balances appears to reflect the desire for liquidity and a better rate than short-term time deposits.\nInterest expense on time deposits increased $51,000, to $2,798,000 in 2016, due to a six basis point increase in yield, from 1.17% in 2015 to 1.23% in 2016. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in average balances of $6,095,000 in 2016, to $228,269,000.\n- 25 -\nSimilar to fixed-rate loans and investment securities, time deposits reprice over time and, therefore, have less of an immediate impact on costs in either a rising or falling rate environment. Unlike loans and investment securities, however, the maturity and repricing characteristics of time deposits tend to be shorter.\nApproximately $95,803,000, or 42.5%, of time deposits at December 31, 2016 will reprice or mature over the next 12 months, compared with 43.9% of the portfolio at December 31, 2015. The average rate paid on these time deposits is approximately 0.72%. QNB has been attempting to extend the maturity of the time deposit portfolio by offering attractive rates at terms 36 months or greater, with moderate success. Given the short-term nature of these deposits, interest expense could increase if short-term time deposit rates were to increase suddenly or if customers select higher paying longer term time deposits.\nShort-term borrowings are comprised of sweep accounts structured as repurchase agreements with our commercial customers and overnight borrowings from correspondent banks with average balances in 2016 of $38,835,000 and $1,365,000, respectively. Interest expense on short-term borrowings increased by $37,000 to $154,000 when comparing the two years. During this period average balances increased $8,289,000 to $40,200,000 while the average rate paid increased one basis point, from 0.37% to 0.38%.\n2015 versus 2014\nTotal interest expense for 2015 was $4,506,000 compared with $4,544,000 for 2014, a decline of $38,000. Interest expense on total deposits increased $29,000 while interest expense on borrowed funds decreased $67,000 when comparing the two years. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased two basis points from 0.58% for 2014 to 0.56% for 2015. During this same period, the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits decreased one basis point to 0.57%. Deposits, increased on average by $34,717,000, or 4.2%, to $863,801,000, when comparing 2015 and 2014.\nAverage non-interest-bearing demand accounts increased $15,719,000, or 19.5%, to $96,146,000 for 2015. Average balances for business checking accounts increased by $12,684,000, or 19.8%, when comparing the two years. Average interest-bearing demand accounts increased $15,711,000, or 13.2%, to $134,342,000 for 2015 compared with 2014 with interest expense on interest-bearing demand accounts increasing $15,000 to $289,000 for 2015. The average rate paid decreased two basis points from 0.23% for 2014 to 0.21% for 2015.\nInterest expense on municipal interest-bearing demand accounts decreased $10,000 to $389,000 for 2015. The average balance of municipal interest-bearing demand accounts decreased $4,565,000, or 3.8%, to $115,975,000, while the average interest rate paid on these accounts increased from 0.33% for 2014 to 0.34% for 2015.\nAverage money market accounts increased $7,080,000, or 12.1%, to $65,413,000 for 2015 compared with 2014. Interest expense on money market accounts increased $32,000 to $158,000 for 2015 compared with 2014. The average interest rate paid on money market accounts was 0.22% for 2014 and 0.24% for 2015, an increase of two basis points.\nOnline eSavings average balances grew $4,718,000, or 3.0%, to $160,781,000 in 2015 compared with $156,063,000 in 2014. The rate on this product was 0.45% during 2014 and was changed to 0.50% in late December 2015. Traditional statement savings accounts and club accounts are also included in the savings category and increased $4,214,000, or 8.0%, to $56,780,000. The average rate paid on total savings accounts was 0.37% for 2014 and 2015, while interest expense increased $36,000, from $770,000 to $806,000 over the same period.\nThe repricing of time deposits at lower rates combined with the decline in average time deposit balances had the greatest impact on total interest expense in 2015. Total interest expense on time deposits decreased $44,000 to $2,747,000 for 2015. Average total time deposits decreased $8,160,000, or 3.4%, to $234,364,000 for 2015. The average rate paid on time deposits increased from 1.15% to 1.17% when comparing 2014 to 2015.\nSweep accounts structured as repurchase agreements with our commercial customers and overnight borrowings from the correspondent banks had average balances in 2015 of $31,364,000 and $547,000, respectively. Interest expense on short-term borrowings increased by $3,000 to $117,000 when comparing the two years. During this period average balances increased $295,000 to $31,911,000 while the average rate paid increased one basis point, from 0.36% to 0.37%.\nContributing to the decrease in total interest expense was a reduction in interest expense on long-term debt of $70,000. The average balance of long-term debt for 2014 was $1,452,000. The final portion of long-term debt taken out in April 2012 matured and was repaid on April 17, 2014. The rate on this long-term debt was 4.75%.\n- 26 -\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses represents management's determination of the amount necessary to be charged to operations to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that represents management's best estimate of the known and inherent losses in the existing loan portfolio. QNB recorded a provision for loan losses of $30,000 for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016, and $200,000 and $400,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Excluding the $220,000 reversal in allowance for loan losses associated with the sale of the indirect lease finance portfolio, 2016 provision would have been $250,000. Net loan charge-offs were $190,000, or 0.03% of total average loans for 2016 compared with $647,000, or 0.11% of total average loans in 2015 and $1,324,000, or 0.25%, in 2014. The majority of the loans charged off during 2016 had specific reserves established during the allowance for loan loss calculation process prior to the decision to charge-off the loans. Deterioration in credit quality or significant growth in the loan portfolio may result in a higher provision for loan losses in 2017.\nNon-Interest Income\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> Non-interest

Total non-interest income includes service charges on deposit accounts, ATM and check card income, retail brokerage and advisory income, income on bank-owned life insurance, merchant income and gains and losses on investment securities and residential mortgage loans. Total non-interest income was $5,667,000 in 2016 compared with $6,032,000 in 2015, a decrease of $365,000. Excluding the loss on sale of indirect finance leasing portfolio of $223,000, the decline in non-interest income is $142,000, comparing 2016 to 2015.\nFees for services to customers are primarily comprised of service charges on deposit accounts. These fees were $1,621,000 for 2016, a decrease of $36,000, or 2.2%, from 2015. Overdraft income, which represented approximately 75% and 74% of total fees for services to customers in 2016 and 2015, respectively, decreased by $21,000, or 1.7%, when comparing 2016 to 2015. The decrease in overdraft income primarily reflects reduction in the number of overdraft occurrences as well as an increase in overdraft fees forgiven.\nATM and debit card income is primarily comprised of transaction income on debit cards and ATM cards and ATM surcharge income for the use of QNB's ATM machines by non-QNB customers. ATM and debit card income was $1,651,000 in 2016, an increase of $80,000, or 5.1%, from the amount recorded in 2015. Debit card interchange income increased $85,000, or 5.6%, to $1,591,000 in 2016, while ATM surcharge income and monthly card fees income decreased $5,000, to $60,000. The growth in checking accounts and card usage among existing card-holders contributed to the increase in debit card income, including the QNB Rewards checking product, a high-yield checking account which requires, among other terms, the posting of a minimum of twelve debit card purchase transactions per statement cycle to receive the high interest rate.\nRetail brokerage and advisory revenue was $603,000 for 2016 compared with $686,000 in 2015, a decline of $83,000, or 12.1%. The reduction in fee income is due to the increase in products with trailing fee income as opposed to upfront fees. QNB provides securities and advisory services under the name QNB Financial Services through Investment Professionals, Inc., an independent third party registered Broker/Dealer and Registered Investment Advisor. QNB receives 75% to 88% of the revenue generated, depending on volume, but is also responsible for salaries and expenses of two advisors who are QNB employees. In 2016, the net income provided by these services was $104,000, compared with $115,000 in net income for 2015.\n- 27 -\nIncome on bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) represents the earnings and death benefits on life insurance policies in which the Bank is the beneficiary. The insurance carriers reset the rates on these policies annually taking into consideration the interest rate environment as well as mortality costs. The existing policies have rate floors which minimize how low the earnings rate can go. Some of these policies are currently at their floor. Income on these policies during 2016 was $308,000, a slight increase when compared to $307,000 for 2015.\nMerchant income represents fees charged to merchants for the Bank's handling of credit card or charge sales. Merchant income was $334,000 for 2016, an increase of $36,000, or 12.1%, from the amount reported in 2015. The increase in merchant income is primarily a result of increased card sales from existing customers and the acquisition of 24 new merchant customers during 2016.\nThe fixed-income securities portfolio represents a significant portion of QNB's earning assets and is also a primary tool in liquidity and asset/liability management. QNB actively manages its fixed-income portfolio to take advantage of changes in the shape of the yield curve, changes in spread relationships in different sectors, and for liquidity purposes. Management continually reviews strategies that will result in an increase in the yield or improvement in the structure of the investment portfolio, including monitoring credit and concentration risk in the portfolio. In addition, the Corporation owns a small portfolio of equity securities for the purpose of generating both dividend income and capital appreciation.\nNet gains on investment securities decreased $109,000 to $674,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $783,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to market conditions which resulted in fewer opportunities for profitable sales in 2016 compared with 2015. The prolonged decline in market value of two equity securities resulted in recording $192,000 in other than temporary impairment in 2016. There were $55,000 in OTTI charges in 2015, related to the prolonged decline in market value of one equity security. Gains, net of other-than-temporary impairment, from equity securities were $566,000 and $636,000, in 2016 and 2015, respectively. With the strong performance in the U.S. equity markets during the first half of 2015 and the latter half of 2016, QNB elected to sell some equity holdings and recognize gains. Net gains on the sale of fixed income securities were $108,000 and $147,000 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. Both the 2016 and 2015 fixed income gains were primarily from the sale of fast paying, lower-yielding or odd-lot mortgage-backed and CMO securities as well as low yielding agency bonds that were likely to be called in the next two years. Net gain on trading securities declined $73,000, to a net loss of $40,000 in 2016, due to the increase in rates during fourth quarter 2016 and the volume of new municipal security issues during the year.\nThe net gain on residential mortgage sales is directly related to the volume of mortgages sold and the timing of the sales relative to the interest rate environment. Residential mortgage loans to be sold are identified at origination. The net gain on the sale of residential mortgage loans was $320,000 and $356,000 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. Mortgage refinance activity decreased in 2016, as rate volatility prompted borrowers to delay borrowing. Proceeds from the sale of residential mortgages were $9,204,000 and $10,903,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Included in the gains on the sale of residential mortgages in 2016 and 2015 are $69,000 and $80,000, respectively, related to the recognition of mortgage servicing assets.\nQNB retains servicing rights for residential mortgages sold in the secondary market. A servicing fee is retained on all mortgage loans sold and serviced. QNB recognizes its obligation to service financial assets that are retained in a transfer of assets in the form of a servicing asset. The servicing asset is amortized in proportion to, and over, the period of net servicing income or loss. On a quarterly basis, servicing assets are assessed for impairment based on their fair value. Mortgage servicing income of $125,000 for 2016 and $129,000 for 2015 is included in other non-interest income.\nOther non-interest income was $419,000 for 2016, an increase of $78,000 from the amount recorded in 2015. Increased revenues from letters of credit, credit cards, title insurance company, sales tax refunds and reduced loss on sale for OREO, repossessed assets and furniture and equipment of $7,000, $9,000, $17,000, $47,000, and $19,000, respectively, were the primary contributors to the increase, when comparing 2016 to 2015.\n2015 versus 2014\nTotal non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $6,032,000 and $7,542,000, respectively, a decrease of $1,510,000, or 20.0%. Excluding the non-recurring items $1,000,000 gain on sale of an internet domain name sale and $158,000 life insurance benefit, QNB posted a decrease in non-interest income of $352,000, or 5.5%, for the twelve months ended of 2015, compared with the same period in 2014.\nATM and debit card income, retail brokerage and advisory income and net gain on sale of loans increased $86,000, $29,000, and $98,000, respectively, to $1,571,000, $686,000, and $356,000, respectively, when comparing the two periods. Mortgage refinance activity increased in 2015 compared to 2014, due to interest rate declines. Net gain on investment securities available for sale decreased $329,000 to $783,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with the same period in 2014. This is due in part to an impairment write down in the equity securities portfolio in 2015 totaling $55,000. Net gains on trading activity decreased $123,000 to $33,000 and represents realized and unrealized gains and losses, net of expenses, on the municipal bond trading account portfolio\n- 28 -\nthat was started during the first quarter of 2014. Fees for services to customers decreased $30,000, or 1.8%, when comparing the year ended December 31, 2015 to prior year with the primary contributor reflective of higher volume of overdrafts.\nOther non-interest income was $341,000 for 2015, a decrease of $75,000 from the amount recorded in 2014. Decreases in mortgage servicing income, letter of credit fees, title insurance, miscellaneous charges, losses on sale of OREO and repossessed equipment and rental income for an OREO property of $6,000, $11,000, $7,000, $20,000, $15,000, and $30,000, respectively, were the main contributors to the decrease.\nNon-Interest Expense\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> Non-interest expense

assessments and taxes and various other operating expenses. Total non-interest expense was $22,163,000 in 2016, a decrease of $235,000, or 1.0%, from the $22,398,000 recorded in 2015. QNB's overhead efficiency ratio, which represents the percentage of each dollar of revenue that is used for non-interest expense, is calculated by taking non-interest expense divided by net operating revenue.

QNB self-funds medical insurance and also has Stop Loss insurance with a third-party insurance carrier which limits its claims expense. Payroll taxes and post-retirement life insurance expense increased $21,000 and $25,000, respectively, while retirement plan matching and safe harbor, and tuition reimbursements declined $28,000 and $13,000, respectively, in 2016.

State tax expense was $666,000 and $681,000 for the years 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Pennsylvania Shares Tax is based primarily on the equity of the Bank and comprises all but $1,000 of the expense in this category. Reduction in Pennsylvania Shares Tax is a result of a deduction utilized due to apportionment of income to New Jersey, and payment of New Jersey state income taxes.\nOther operating expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 decreased $117,000, or 5.1%, primarily due to decreased debit card expenses. Debit card expenses in 2015 included a $208,000 contract termination fee related to card platform upgrades which occurred during 2016. Excluding this contract termination expense, debit card expenses increased $93,000, of which $61,000 was increased card loss expense, due to increased card compromises in 2016.

Debit card expenses include a $208,000 contract termination fee related to card platform upgrades to occur during 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nApplicable income taxes and effective tax rates were $3,054,000, or 25.5%, for 2016 compared with $2,570,000, or 23.8%, for 2015. The higher effective tax rate year over year is predominately a result of tax-exempt income from loans and securities comprising a smaller proportional share of pre-tax income than the prior year. Full utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in prior years for QNB Corp. resulted in additional state income tax expense in 2016. For a more comprehensive analysis of income tax expense and deferred taxes, refer to Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nApplicable income taxes and effective tax rates were $2,570,000, or 23.8% for 2015 and $2,644,000, or 22.7%, for 2014, predominately a result of tax-exempt income from loans and securities comprising a smaller proportional share of pre-tax income.\n- 30 -\nFinancial Condition\nASSETS\nThe following table presents total assets at the dates indicated:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (6,270\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -36.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 394,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 366,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restricted investment in bank stocks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans held-for-sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (198\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -20.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 633,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 615,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,394\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,554\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Premises and equipment, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (574\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bank-owned life insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accrued interest receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,063,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,020,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash and interest-earning deposits\nTotal cash and cash equivalents decreased $6,270,000 from $16,991,000 at December 31, 2015 to $10,721,000 at December 31, 2016. QNB had interest bearing balances at the Federal Reserve Bank of $261,000 at December 31, 2016 compared with $6,402,000 at December 31, 2015. The low interest rate environment that has existed for approximately the past eight years resulted in a significant amount of agency and municipal bonds being called as well an increase in the amount of prepayments on mortgage-backed securities and CMOs. The rate uptick at the end of 2016 significantly slowed these prepayments, which is reflected in the reduced amount of cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank.\nInvestment Securities and Other Short-Term Investments\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, QNB had no Federal funds sold. With the Federal funds rate between 0.25% and 0.50%, excess funds for liquidity purposes are kept at the Federal Reserve which was paying 0.50% until the Federal Open Market Committee raised the targeted Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points in late December 2016. These funds carry a 0% risk weighting for risk-based capital calculation purposes.\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> Investment Portfolio History\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trading Securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State and municipal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total trading securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment Securities Available-for-Sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Government agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 62,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State and municipal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Government agencies and sponsored enterprises (GSEs):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage-backed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 145,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 136,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 136,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pooled trust preferred\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total investment securities available-for-sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 390,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 361,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 375,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment Securities Held-to-Maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State and municipal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total investment securities held-to-maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total investment securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 394,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 366,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 379,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n- 31 -\nAt December 31, 2016, approximately 76% of QNB's investment securities were either U.S. Government agency debt securities, U.S. Government agency issued mortgage-backed securities or CMOs. As of December 31, 2016, QNB held no securities of any one issue or any one issuer (excluding the U.S. Government and its agencies) that were in excess of 10% of shareholders' equity.\nThe QNB investment portfolio represents a significant portion of earning assets and interest income. QNB actively manages the investment portfolio in an attempt to maximize earnings, while considering liquidity needs, interest rate risk and credit risk. Proceeds from the sale of investments were $32,573,000 in 2016 compared with $47,960,000 during 2015.\nIn addition to the proceeds from the sale of investment securities, proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments of securities were $107,425,000 in 2016, compared with $94,372,000 in 2015. The significant amount of proceeds in both years reflects the low interest rate environment that has existed for approximately the past eight years, which resulted in a significant amount of agency and municipal bonds being called as well an increase in the amount of prepayments on mortgage-backed securities and CMOs. The increase of the investment portfolio as a percent of total assets in 2016 is due to reduced loan growth and continued deposit growth. During 2016, $174,943,000 of investment securities were purchased compared with $132,048,000 during 2015.\nThe balance of U.S. Government agency securities increased $14,871,000 to $76,650,000 at December 31, 2016, and represents 19.5% of the investment portfolio compared with 16.9% at December 31, 2015. Bond proceeds from called agency bonds was reinvested back into this portfolio because of the attractive yields relative to amortizing securities. The seasonal inflow of municipal deposits was invested in Agencies, as well. U.S. Government agency issued CMO and MBS balances grew $20,425,000 to $222,716,000 and represents 56.5% of the portfolio compared with 55.2% at December 31, 2015. These bonds provide monthly cash flow to be reinvested in either loans or other securities, potentially at higher yields as rates increase.\nThe balance of municipal securities decreased $7,252,000 to $75,891,000 -- $3,596,000 in trading and $72,295,000 in available for sale -- at December 31, 2016, representing 19.3% of the investment portfolio compared with 22.7% at December 31, 2015. QNB focuses on the financial performance of the underlying issuer for municipal bond purchases in addition to the bond rating of the issuer or the rating of bond insurer, if present. Thirty-five bonds with a book value of $12,820,000 were called or matured in 2016, and purchased municipal securities had significantly lower yields then the bonds they replaced, which contributed to the decline in the yield on the portfolio.\nQNB owns collateralized debt obligations ( CDO\u201d) in the form of pooled trust preferred securities. These securities are comprised mainly of securities issued by banks or bank holding companies, and to a lesser degree, insurance companies. In most cases, QNB owns the mezzanine tranches of these securities. These securities are structured so that the senior and mezzanine tranches are protected from defaults by over-collateralization and cash flow default protection provided by subordinated tranches. QNB holds six of these securities with an amortized cost of $2,909,000 and a fair value of $2,281,000 at December 31, 2016 and amortized cost of $3,291,000 and a fair value of $2,653,000 at December 31, 2015. All of the trust preferred securities are available-for-sale securities and are carried at fair value. There were no credit-related OTTI charges during 2016, 2015, or 2014 on these securities. Future estimates of fair value of these securities could require recording additional OTTI charges through earnings. QNB uses an independent third party to value these securities and to determine if credit-related OTTI exists. For additional detail on these securities see Notes 4 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nQNB accounts for its investments by classifying securities into three categories. Securities that QNB has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity securities and reported at amortized cost. Debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Debt and equity securities not classified as either held-to-maturity securities or trading securities are classified as available-for-sale securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity. Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase.\n- 32 -\nInvestment Portfolio Maturities and Weighted Average Yields\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td> December

Weighted average yields on investment securities available-for-sale are based on amortized cost.\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> All pooled trust preferred securities are on non-accrual status.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Securities - Trading\nIn 2014, QNB established a small percentage of its investment portfolio as trading in an effort to boost yields and income. During the first quarter of 2014 QNB sold approximately $5,000,000 of available-for-sale municipal securities with the proceeds reinvested into a municipal trading account. QNB held trading securities of $3,596,000 and $4,189,000 with an additional $1,499,000 and $1,349,000 in a brokerage cash account at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. QNB recorded a net loss of $40,000 for 2016 and net gains of $33,000 for 2015 and $156,000 for 2014, respectively, in non-interest income comprising realized and unrealized gains.\nInvestments Available-For-Sale\nAvailable-for-sale investment securities include securities that management intends to use as part of its liquidity and asset/liability management strategy. These securities may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in the securities prepayment or credit risk, the need for liquidity, or growth in loan demand. At December 31, 2016, the fair value of investment securities available-for-sale was $390,475,000, or $5,693,000 below the amortized cost of $396,168,000. This compares to a fair value of $361,915,000, or $827,000 below the amortized cost of $362,742,000, at December 31, 2015. The available-for-sale portfolio, excluding equity securities and the pooled trust preferred securities, had a weighted average maturity of approximately 3.9 years at December 31, 2016 and 3.6 years at December 31, 2015. The weighted average tax-equivalent yield was 2.34% and 2.44% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n- 33 -\nThe weighted average maturity is based on the stated contractual maturity or likely call date of all securities except for MBS and CMOs, which are based on estimated average life. The maturity of the portfolio could become shorter if interest rates declined and prepayments on MBS and CMOs increased or securities are called. However, the estimated average life could lengthen if interest rates were to increase and principal payments on MBS and CMOs slowed or securities anticipated to be called extend past their call date.\nInvestments Held-To-Maturity\nInvestment securities held-to-maturity are recorded at amortized cost. At December 31, 2015, there was a single municipal security in the held-to-maturity portfolio with an amortized cost of $147,000 and fair value of $151,000. That bond matured in 2016.\nLoans\nQNB's primary business is to accept deposits and to make loans to meet the credit needs of the communities it serves. Loans are the most significant component of earning assets, and growth in loans to small businesses and residents of these communities has been a primary focus of QNB. Inherent within the lending function is the evaluation and acceptance of credit risk and interest rate risk. QNB manages credit risk associated with its lending activities through portfolio diversification, underwriting policies and procedures and loan monitoring practices.\nQNB has comprehensive policies and procedures that define and govern commercial loan, retail loan and indirect lease financing originations and the management of risk. All loans are underwritten in a manner that emphasizes the borrowers' capacity to pay. The measurement of capacity to pay delineates the potential risk of non-payment or default. The higher potential for default determines the need for and amount of collateral required. QNB makes unsecured commercial loans when the capacity to pay is considered substantial. As capacity lessens, collateral is required to provide a secondary source of repayment and to mitigate the risk of loss. Various policies and procedures provide guidance to the lenders on such factors as amount, terms, price, maturity and appropriate collateral levels. Each risk factor is considered critical to ensuring that QNB receives an adequate return for the risk undertaken, and that the risk of loss is minimized.\nQNB manages the risk associated with commercial loans by having lenders work in tandem with credit analysts while maintaining independence between personnel. In addition, a Bank loan committee and a committee of the Board of Directors review and approve certain loan requests on a weekly basis. At December 31, 2016, there were no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans other than disclosed in the Loan Portfolio table.\nQNB's commercial lending activity is focused on small businesses within the local community. Commercial purpose loans are generally perceived as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans with a personal purpose and consumer loans. These types of loans involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or group of related borrowers and are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. These loans may involve greater risk because the availability of funds to repay these loans depends on the successful operation of the borrower's business. The assets financed are used within the business for its ongoing operation. Repayment of these kinds of loans generally comes from the cash flow of the business or the ongoing conversions of assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory, to cash. Commercial and industrial loans represent commercial purpose loans that are either secured by collateral other than real estate or unsecured.\nCommercial loans secured by commercial real estate include commercial purpose loans collateralized at least in part by commercial real estate. Some of these loans may not be for the express purpose of conducting commercial real estate transactions. Commercial loans secured by residential real estate are commercial purpose loans generally secured by the business owner's residence or residential investment properties owned by the borrower and rented to tenants. Commercial loans secured by either commercial real estate or residential real estate are originated primarily within the Eastern Pennsylvania market area, are within the Bank's underwriting criteria, and generally include the guarantee of the borrowers. Repayment of this kind of loan is dependent upon either the ongoing cash flow of the borrowing entity or the resale of or lease of the subject property. Commercial real estate and commercial construction loans may be affected to a greater extent than residential loans by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy because commercial real estate borrowers' ability to repay their loans depends on successful development of their properties.\nLoans to state and political subdivisions are tax-exempt or taxable loans to municipalities, school districts and housing and industrial development authorities. These loans can be general obligations of the municipality or school district repaid through their taxing authority, revenue obligations repaid through the income generated by the operations of the authority, such as a water or sewer authority, or loans issued to a housing and industrial development agency, for which a private corporation is responsible for payments on the loans.\nThe Company originates fixed rate and adjustable-rate residential real estate loans that are secured by the underlying 1-4 family residential properties. Credit risk exposure in this area of lending is minimized by the evaluation of the credit worthiness of the borrower, including debt-to-income ratios, credit scores and adherence to underwriting policies that emphasize conservative loan-to-\n- 34 -\nvalue ratios of generally no more than 80%. To reduce interest rate risk, substantially all originations of fixed-rate loans to individuals for 1-4 family residential mortgages with maturities of 15 years or greater are generally sold in the secondary market. Mortgage loan origination activity declined in 2016 with $8,686,000 in residential mortgages originated for sale during 2016, compared with $11,154,000 for 2015. Refinancing drove the higher originations in 2015. There was $789,000 in residential mortgage loans held-for-sale at December 31, 2016, and $987,000 in residential mortgage loans held-for-sale at December 31, 2015. These loans are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market.\nThe home equity portfolio consists of fixed-rate home equity loans and variable rate home equity lines of credit. These loans are often in a junior lien position and therefore carry a higher risk than first lien 1-4 family residential loans. Risks associated with loans secured by residential properties, either first lien residential mortgages or home equity loans and lines, are generally lower than commercial loans and include general economic risks, such as the strength of the job market, employment stability and the strength of the housing market. Since most loans are secured by a primary or secondary residence, the borrower's continued employment is the greatest risk to repayment.\nThe Company offers a variety of loans to individuals for personal and household purposes. Consumer loans are generally considered to have greater risk than loans secured by residential real estate because they may be unsecured, or, if they are secured, the value of the collateral may be difficult to assess or more likely to decrease in value than real estate. Credit risk in this portfolio is controlled by conservative underwriting standards that consider debt-to-income levels and the creditworthiness of the borrower, and, if secured, the value of the collateral.\nTotal loans, excluding loans held-for-sale, at December 31, 2016 were $633,079,000, an increase of $17,809,000, or 2.9%, from December 31, 2015. This follows a 10.8% increase in outstanding loans in 2015. A key financial ratio, loans to deposits, improved slightly to 69.3% at December 31, 2016, compared with 69.1% at December 31, 2015. QNB continues to be committed to make loans available to credit worthy consumers and businesses.\nThe Allowance for Loan Losses Allocation table on page 39 shows the percentage composition of the loan portfolio over the past five years. There was very little change in the composition of the portfolio between the periods ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, with the exceptions of the divestiture of the indirect lease financing portfolio in 2016. Loans secured by commercial real estate represent the largest sector of the portfolio, increasing from 38.2% of the portfolio at December 31, 2015 to 40.3% of the portfolio at December 31, 2016, while balances in this sector grew by $20,017,000, or 8.5%, from $235,171,000 at December 31, 2015 to $255,188,000 at December 31, 2016. While loans secured by commercial real estate represent a significant portion of the total portfolio, the collateral is diversified, including investment properties, manufacturing facilities, office buildings, hospitals, retirement and nursing home facilities, warehouses and owner-occupied facilities. Commercial real estate loans have drawn the attention of the regulators in recent years as a potential source of risk. QNB monitors these types of loans closely, obtaining updated appraisals on loans classified substandard or worse. As detailed in the Allowance for Loan Losses table, QNB had no charge-offs in this category in 2016 compared with $84,000 in 2015 and $70,000 in 2014. The 2015 charge-offs were due primarily to the sale of collateral for impaired loans; 2014's charge-off was for a single loan under agreement of sale.\nCommercial loans secured by residential real estate increased by $5,567,000, or 8.8%, to $68,731,000 at December 31, 2016 and at 10.9% represent a slightly larger share of the overall portfolio than the 10.3% at December 31, 2015. Some of the properties that serve as collateral for these loans are located outside the Bank's market area and have experienced vacancies and significant declines in market value. Charge-offs in this category have decreased over the past three years. Non-accrual commercial loans secured by residential real estate were $1,866,000, $1,803,000, and $1,467,000 at December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and loan charge-offs were $120,000, $531,000, and $1,069,000, respectively, in 2016, 2015 and 2014. In 2016, approximately $96,000 of the $120,000 in charge-offs were out of market investment properties, compared with $279,000 of the $531,000 charge-offs in the same category for 2015.\n- 35 -\nCommercial and industrial loans, the second largest sector of the portfolio, experienced a decline in balances of $14,164,000, or 11.4%, to $110,233,000 at December 31, 2016. This followed growth in this category of $5,552,000, or 4.7%, in 2015. Commercial and industrial loans represented 17.4% of the portfolio at year-end 2016 compared with 20.2% at December 31, 2015. This category of loans generally presents a greater risk than loans secured by real estate since these loans are either secured by accounts receivable, inventory or equipment, or unsecured. During 2016 nonaccrual commercial and industrial loan balances increased $1,365,000 to $4,798,000, due primarily to the financial difficulties and downgrade of one credit during 2016. In 2016, 2015, and 2014 charge-offs were $140,000, $56,000, and $17,000, respectively, and in 2014, recoveries in this segment were $67,000, exceeding the charge-offs.\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>

Table details final maturity.\nThe following shows the amount of loans due after one year that have fixed interest rates and variable or adjustable interest rates at December 31, 2016:\nLoans with fixed predetermined interest rates: $72,220,000\nLoans with variable or adjustable interest rates: $476,248,000\nConstruction loans increased 43.5% from $27,372,000, or 4.4% of the portfolio at December 31, 2015, to $39,268,000, or 6.2% of the portfolio at December 31, 2016. These loans are primarily to developers and builders for the construction of residential units or commercial buildings or to businesses for the construction of owner-occupied facilities. This portfolio is diversified among different types of collateral including: 1-4 family residential construction, medical and retirement home facilities, office buildings, hotels and land for development loans. Construction loans are generally made only on projects that have municipal approval. These loans are usually originated to include a short construction period followed by permanent financing provided through a commercial mortgage after construction is complete. Once construction is complete the balance is moved to the secured by commercial real estate category if the permanent financing is provided by the Bank. The growth in the portfolio in 2016 is related to construction loans for several\n- 36 -\nbusiness expansions in the Bank's market footprint. There were no charge-offs in the construction loan portfolio since 2011, and no construction loans on non-accrual since 2014.\nLoans to state and political subdivisions decreased $5,025,000, or 12.5%, from $40,285,000 at December 31, 2015 to $35,260,000 at December 31, 2016. This sector declined from 6.5% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 to 5.6% at December 31, 2016. With the decline in interest rates through most of 2016, many municipalities, counties and school districts refinanced their existing bonds or bank debt. As a result, QNB is getting an opportunity to bid on many of these local issues and has been successful in winning several of those bids. The refinancing activity has also resulted in a reduction in yield. QNB expects the balance in this category to increase in 2017 as some of the commitments for large projects won during 2016 may start to fund during the first quarter of 2017.\nQNB desires to become the local consumer lender of choice\u201d and to affect this QNB has refocused its retail lending efforts by strengthening the management of the area, adding new product offerings and increasing marketing and promotion. This focus resulted in increased balances in home equity loans and lines of $4,141,000, or 6.1%, to $71,525,000 at December 31, 2016. During 2016, in an effort to increase demand, QNB offered very attractive rates on both variable and fixed rate home equity loans and lines. These promotional rates along with excellent customer service, including quick turnaround time, contributed to the growth in home equity balances. With continued improvement in home values as well as the local economy, it is expected that the demand for home equity loans will continue.\nConsumer loan balances increased $1,384,000 to $5,670,000 at December 31, 2016. In 2013, QNB reentered the private student loan market through a relationship with iHelp. These student loans are either fixed or variable rate with the rate dependent on the credit scores of the student and/or the cosigner. Principal and interest protection is provided by ReliaMax, an insurance company for private student loans. As of December 31, 2016, the balance of student loans was $2,640,000, an increase of $1,484,000 compared with December 31, 2015.\nQNB increased the balances of residential mortgage loans secured by first lien 1-4 family residential mortgages by $4,291,000, or 10.0%, to $47,124,000 at December 31, 2016. This followed an increase of $5,686,000, or 15.3%, between December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015. In 2016, QNB retained some adjustable and fixed rate mortgages to borrowers with high credit scores and low loan-to-value ratios.\nNon-Performing Assets\nNon-performing assets include non-performing loans, OREO and repossessed assets and non-performing trust preferred securities. Non-performing assets totaled $14,219,000, or 1.34% of total assets at December 31, 2016, an $847,000 increase over the $13,372,000, or 1.31% of total assets at December 31, 2015. Included in non-performing assets in 2016 and 2015 is $2,281,000 and $2,653,000, respectively, of pooled trust preferred securities, discussed in the section titled Investment Securities and Other Short-Term Investments\u201d.\nTotal non-performing loans, which represent loans on non-accrual status, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest and troubled debt restructured loans were $11,938,000, or 1.89% of total loans at December 31, 2016 compared with $10,719,000, or 1.74% of total loans at December 31, 2015. Loans on non-accrual status were $10,119,000 at December 31, 2016 compared with $9,420,000 at December 31, 2015. Two large relationships totaling $2,632,000 were designated non-accrual in the fourth quarter of 2016. In cases where there is a collateral shortfall on non-accrual loans, specific impairment reserves have been established based on updated collateral values even if the borrower continues to pay in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Of the total amount of non-accrual loans at December 31, 2016, $7,749,000, or approximately 77% of the loans classified as non-accrual, are current or past due less than 30 days as of the end of the year.\nQNB had no loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing at December 31, 2016, compared with one lease for $11,000 at December 31, 2015. Total loans that are 30 days or more past due increased $1,218,000 to $4,937,000, representing 0.78% of total loans at December 31, 2016 compared with 0.60% of total loans at December 31, 2015. Restructured loans, as defined in accounting guidance for troubled debt restructuring in ASC 310-40, that have not already been included in loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing or in non-accrual loans totaled $1,819,000 and $1,288,000 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n- 37 -\nQNB held no OREO at December 31, 2015 or 2016.

to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Management's view is that loans classified as substandard or doubtful that are not included in the past due, non-accrual or restructured categories are potential problem loans. For some of these loans management may have knowledge of possible credit problems that will cause management to question the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms. Commercial loans classified as substandard or doubtful, which includes non-performing loans, continue to show improvement. At December 31, 2016, substandard or doubtful loans totaled $22,204,000, a reduction of $5,121,000, or 18.7%, from the $27,325,000 reported as of December 31, 2015.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's best estimate of the known and inherent losses in the existing loan portfolio. Management believes that it uses the best information available to make determinations about the adequacy of the allowance and that it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The determination of an appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is based upon an analysis of the risks inherent in QNB's loan portfolio. Management, in determining the allowance for loan losses makes significant estimates and assumptions. Since the allowance for loan losses is dependent on conditions that may be beyond QNB's control, it is at least reasonably possible that management's estimates of the allowance for loan losses and actual results could differ. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an\n- 38 -\nintegral part of their examination process, periodically review QNB's allowance for losses on loans. Such agencies may require QNB to recognize changes to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Actual loan losses, net of recoveries, serve to reduce the allowance.\nManagement closely monitors the quality of its loan portfolio and performs a quarterly analysis of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and the level of unallocated reserves. This analysis considers a number of relevant factors including: specific impairment reserves, historical loan loss experience, general economic conditions, levels of and trends in delinquent and non-performing loans, levels of classified loans, trends in the growth rate of loans and concentrations of credit.\nEconomic conditions, nationally and in QNB's market, continued to improve in 2016, and asset quality remained strong. The allowance level decreased from $7,554,000 at year-end 2015 to $7,394,000 at year-end 2016, which, stated as a percent of loans receivable, declined from 1.23% at December 31, 2015 to 1.17% at December 31, 2016.\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> Allowance for Loan Losses Allocation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Percent gross loans lists the percentage of each loan type to total loans.\n- 39 -\nA loan is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that QNB will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls may not be classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the recorded investment in loans for which impairment has been identified totaled $15,006,000 and $14,941,000, respectively, of which $10,909,000 and $12,414,000, respectively, required no specific allowance for loan loss. The recorded investment in impaired loans requiring an allowance for loan losses was $4,097,000 and $2,527,000 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 the related allowance for loan losses associated with these loans was $1,198,000 and $974,000, respectively.

loans for 2014. The majority of charge-offs recorded during these periods had specific reserves established during the allowance for loan loss calculation process prior to the decision to charge-off the loan. The trend in decreasing charge-offs for both retail and commercial loans from 2014 through 2016 was due to improvements in asset quality, credit monitoring and the improving economic environment.\nManagement believes the allowance for loan losses of $7,394,000 is adequate as of December 31, 2016, in relation to the estimate of known and inherent losses in the portfolio.\nPremises and equipment\nPremises and equipment, net of depreciation decreased $574,000 to $8,683,000 at December 31, 2016, as equipment purchases declined from $580,000 in 2015 to $317,000 in 2016.\nOther assets\nOther assets, as presented in the table on page 31, increased $2,064,000 from $5,686,000 at December 31, 2015 to $7,750,000 at December 31, 2016. Most of the increase in other assets relates to a $1,829,000 increase to the deferred tax asset resulting from the change in fair value of the available-for-sale investment portfolio between December 31, 2015 and 2016. The detail of the net deferred tax asset can be found in Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLIABILITIES\nThe following table presents total liabilities at the dates indicated:\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 913,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 889,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accrued interest payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 969,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 930,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeposits\nQNB primarily attracts deposits from within its market area by offering various deposit products. These deposits are in the form of time deposits, which include certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts (IRA's) which have a stated maturity, and non-maturity deposit accounts, which include: non-interest bearing demand accounts, interest-bearing demand accounts, money market accounts and savings accounts.\nTotal deposits increased $23,569,000, or 2.6%, to $913,355,000 at December 31, 2016. This follows an increase of $38,194,000, or 4.5%, between 2014 and 2015. The growth in deposits as well as the mix of deposits continues to be impacted by customers' reactions to the industry, regulations and the interest rate environment. Many customers are looking for transaction accounts that provide liquidity and pay a reasonable amount of interest, in anticipation of increasing rates in 2017. However, despite the decline in overall time deposit balances, those maturing in 60 months have increased due to customers seeking a higher rate of interest and not being concerned about liquidity. Customers appear to be looking for the safety of FDIC insured deposits and the stability of a strong local community bank.\nContributing to the increase in total deposits was growth in non-interest bearing demand accounts, which increased $20,467,000, or 20.8%, to $119,010,000 at December 31, 2016. This followed growth of $11,623,000, or 13.4%, between December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015. These deposits are primarily comprised of business checking accounts and are volatile depending on the timing of\n- 41 -\ndeposits and withdrawals. QNB has been successful in attracting new customers and expanding relationships with existing customers, which not only contributes to the increase in balances but also provides an opportunity for fee income.\nInterest-bearing demand accounts, retail and business interest checking and municipal accounts decreased $19,171,000, or 7.0%, to $255,754,000 at December 31, 2016. All segments experienced growth in 2016 except municipal deposits and business interest checking, which declined $30,976,000, or 25.0%, to $92,767,000, and $1,569,000, or 8.5%, to $16,861,000, respectively. While QNB has been successful in developing relationships with several school districts and municipalities as well as expanding existing relationships, the balances in these accounts are seasonal in nature and can be volatile on a daily basis. Most of the school district taxes are collected during the third quarter of the year and are disbursed over a nine-month period.\nRewards checking balances increased from $45,208,000 at December 31, 2015 to $49,428,000 at December 31, 2016, and Select 50 balances increased from $69,744,000 to $77,959,000 over this same period. Personal interest-bearing balances also increased from $17,800,000 at December 31, 2015 to $18,739,000 at December 31, 2016. QNB continues to open a significant number of new checking accounts.\nTotal savings account balances increased $16,477,000, or 7.4%, to $238,247,000 at December 31, 2016. This increase is due primarily to an increase in the online eSavings account of $11,746,000, or 7.2%, to $174,319,000 at December 31, 2016. The eSavings account was introduced in 2009 to compete with competitors' online savings products and currently yields 0.55%.\nTotal time deposit account balances were $225,582,000 at December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1,794,000, or 0.8%, from the amount reported at December 31, 2015. As time deposits matured during the past two years they were frequently reinvested in the high yielding and liquid Rewards or Select 50 checking, money market or eSavings accounts which, in many instances paid a rate higher than what was offered on short-term time deposits.\nTo continue to attract and retain deposits, QNB plans to remain competitive with respect to rates and to continue to deliver products with terms and features that appeal to customers. The QNB Rewards checking and online eSavings accounts are examples of such products.\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> Maturity of Time Deposits of $100,000 or More\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

at December 31, 2016. Commercial sweeps grew $8,176,000, or 22.0%, to $45,339,000 in 2016. The remainder of the increase related to $7,321,000 of overnight FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2016. QNB had no FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2015.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity represents an institution's ability to generate cash or otherwise obtain funds at reasonable rates to satisfy demand for loans and deposit withdrawals. QNB attempts to manage its mix of cash and interest-bearing balances, Federal funds sold and investment\n- 42 -\nsecurities to match the volatility, seasonality, interest sensitivity and growth trends of its loans and deposits. The Company manages its liquidity risk by measuring and monitoring its liquidity sources and estimated funding needs. Liquidity is provided from asset sources through repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities. The portfolio of investment securities classified as available for sale and QNB's policy of selling certain residential mortgage originations in the secondary market also provide sources of liquidity. Core deposits and cash management repurchase agreements have historically been the most significant funding source for QNB. These deposits and repurchase agreements are generated from a base of consumers, businesses and public funds primarily located in the Company's market area.\nAn additional source of liquidity is provided by the Bank's membership in the FHLB. At December 31, 2016, the Bank had a maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB of approximately $240,878,000, net of the $7,321,000 outstanding at year-end 2016. The maximum borrowing capacity changes as a function of qualifying collateral assets. QNB had no FHLB borrowing at December 31, 2015. In addition, the Bank maintains four unsecured Federal funds lines with four correspondent banks totaling $46,000,000. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings under these lines. Future availability under these lines is subject to the policies of the granting banks and may be withdrawn. As part of its contingency funding plan, QNB successfully tested its ability to borrow from these sources during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTotal cash and cash equivalents, trading and available-for-sale securities and loans held-for-sale totaled $405,581,000 at December 31, 2016 and $384,082,000 at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, investment securities totaling $166,628,000 and $197,149,000, respectively, were pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements and public deposits. This increase in liquid sources is primarily the result of a $28,560,000 increase in available-for-sale securities. Management anticipates that these liquid sources are adequate to meet normal fluctuations in loan demand or deposit withdrawals. It is anticipated that the investment portfolio will continue to provide sufficient liquidity as municipal bonds are called and as principal and interest payments on mortgage-backed and CMO securities provide steady cash flow. An increase in interest rates, however, would result in decreased cash flow available from the investment portfolio.\nQNB is a member of the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Services (CDARS) program offered by the Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC. CDARS is a funding and liquidity management tool used by banks to access funds and manage their balance sheet. It enables financial institutions to provide customers with full FDIC insurance on time deposits over $250,000 that are placed in the program. QNB also has available Insured Cash Sweep (ICS), another program through Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC, which is a product similar to CDARS, but one that provides liquidity like a money market or savings account.\nOther liabilities\nOther liabilities comprise accrued expenses including salaries, post-retirement life insurance benefits and income taxes, deferred revenue, and ATM/debit card processing clearing. This category increased $10,000 to $3,224,000 at December 31, 2016.\nSHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nThe following table presents total shareholders' equity at the dates indicated:\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Surplus\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retained earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,757\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (546\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,211\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 588.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Treasury stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,476\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,476\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 93,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 90,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal shareholders' equity increased $3,124,000, or 3.5%, to $93,567,000 at December 31, 2016 with retained earnings -- net income less dividends paid -- contributing $4,858,000 and the dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, employee stock purchase plan and stock option plan contributing $1,389,000. Accumulated other comprehensive income decreased $3,211,000, resulting from the decrease in fair value of the available-for-sale investment portfolio caused by increasing interest rates at the end of 2016. QNB remains well capitalized\u201d based on FDIC requirements.\nCapital Adequacy\nA strong capital position is fundamental to support continued growth and profitability and to serve the needs of depositors. QNB's shareholders' equity at December 31, 2016 was $93,567,000, or 8.80% of total assets, compared with shareholders' equity of\n- 43 -\n$90,443,000, or 8.86% of total assets, at December 31, 2015. Shareholders' equity at December 31, 2016 included a negative adjustment of $3,757,000 related to unrealized holding losses, net of taxes, on investment securities available for sale. At December 31, 2015 shareholders' equity included a negative adjustment of $546,000, related to unrealized holding losses, net of taxes, on investment securities available-for-sale. Excluding these adjustments, shareholders' equity to total assets would have been 9.12% and 8.91% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAverage shareholders' equity and average total assets were $94,472,000 and $1,031,198,000 for 2016, an increase of 6.6% and 4.4%, respectively, from 2015 average equity and average total assets of $88,642,000 and $987,894,000, respectively. The ratio of average total equity to total average assets was 9.16% for 2016, compared with 8.97% for 2015.\nQNB is subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends to its shareholders pursuant to the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law as amended (the BCL). The BCL operates generally to preclude dividend payments, if the effect thereof would render QNB insolvent, as defined. As a practical matter, QNB's payment of dividends is contingent upon its ability to obtain funding in the form of dividends from the Bank. Under Pennsylvania banking law, the Bank is subject to certain restrictions on the amount of dividends that it may declare without prior regulatory approval. At December 31, 2016, the retained earnings of the Bank, totaling $86,430,000 was available for dividends without prior regulatory approval, subject to the regulatory capital requirements discussed below. QNB paid dividends to its shareholders of $1.20 per share, $1.16 per share, and $1.12 per share, in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nQNB is subject to various regulatory capital requirements as issued by Federal regulatory authorities. Regulatory capital is defined in terms of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2. Risk-based capital ratios are expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. Risk-weighted assets are determined by assigning various weights to all assets and off-balance sheet arrangements, such as letters of credit and loan commitments, based on associated risk. QNB is subject to various regulatory capital requirements as issued by Federal regulatory authorities. The final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital guidelines for U.S. banks ( Basel III\u201d) became effective for QNB on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all the of final rule's requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule, to be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019.\nUnder the final rules, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banks. The rules included a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.5%, raised the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0%, required a minimum ratio of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, and required a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. A new capital conservation buffer, comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital, is also established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements. This capital conservation buffer will be phased in beginning January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increase each subsequent year by an additional 0.625% until reaching its final level of 2.5% on January 1, 2019. Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented. The final rules also revised the definition and calculation of Tier 1 capital, Total Capital, and risk-weighted assets. QNB continues to monitor the effect of these new rules on the business, operations and capital levels of the Company and the Bank.\nContinuing to impact risk-weighted assets is the $22,865,000 of risk-weighted assets due to mezzanine tranches of pooled trust preferred securities that were downgraded below investment grade during the first quarter of 2009. Although the amortized cost of these securities was only $2,909,000 at December 31, 2016, regulatory guidance required an additional $19,956,000 to be included in risk-weighted assets. The Bank utilized the method as outlined in the Call Report Instructions for an available-for-sale bond that has not triggered the Low Level Exposure (LLE) rule. The mezzanine tranches of CDOs that utilized this method of risk-weighting are five out of six pooled trust preferred securities (PreTSLs) held by the Bank as of December 31, 2016. The other pooled trust preferred security has only one tranche remaining so the treatment noted above does not apply.\nQNB offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the Plan\u201d) to provide participants a convenient and economical method for investing cash dividends paid on the Company's common stock in additional shares at a discount. The Plan also allows participants to make additional cash purchases of stock at a discount.

QNB's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and liquidity risk. QNB's liquidity position was discussed in a prior section.\nQNB's largest source of revenue is net interest income, which is subject to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk management seeks to minimize the effect of interest rate changes on net interest margins and interest rate spreads and to provide growth in net interest income through periods of changing interest rates. QNB's Asset/Liability and Investment Management Committee (ALCO) is responsible for managing interest rate risk and for evaluating the impact of changing interest rate conditions on net interest income.\nQNB uses computer simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of projected earnings to changes in interest rates. Simulation considers current balance sheet volumes and the scheduled repricing dates, instrument level optionality, and maturities of assets and liabilities. It incorporates assumptions for growth, changes in the mix of assets and liabilities, prepayments, and average rates earned and paid. Based on this information, management uses the model to project net interest income under multiple interest rate scenarios.\nA balance sheet is considered liability sensitive when its liabilities (deposits and borrowings) reprice faster or to a greater extent than its earning assets (loans and securities). A liability sensitive balance sheet will produce relatively less net interest income when interest rates rise and more net interest income when they decline. Based on our simulation analysis, management believes QNB's interest sensitivity position at December 31, 2016 is liability sensitive. Management expects that market interest rates may gradually increase in the next 12 months, based on the economic environment and policy of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\nThe following table shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 assuming instantaneous rate shocks, and consistent levels of assets and liabilities. Net interest income for the subsequent twelve months is projected to decrease when interest rates are higher than current rates.\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> Estimated change in net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in interest rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (basis points)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -10.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -11.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -6.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -7.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -3.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -3.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td> certain short-term rates are below 1%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComputations of future effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Assets and liabilities may react differently than projected to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag changes in market interest rates. Interest rate shifts may not be parallel.\nChanges in interest rates can cause substantial changes in the amount of prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, which may in turn affect QNB's interest rate sensitivity position. Additionally, credit risk may rise if an interest rate increase adversely affects the ability of borrowers to service their debt.\nQNB is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk. At December 31, 2016 QNB did not have any hedging transactions in place such as interest rate swaps, caps or floors.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recently issued accounting standards.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nDisclosure of the Company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Additional information is contained in Management's Discussion and Analysis and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the most sensitive of these issues. The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements of QNB, which are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and predominant practices within the banking industry. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires QNB to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. QNB evaluates estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to the determination of the\n- 46 -\nallowance for loan losses, the determination of the valuation of other real estate owned, other-than-temporary impairments on investment securities, the determination of impairment of restricted bank stock, the valuation of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and income taxes. QNB bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOther-than-Temporary Investment Security Impairment\nSecurities are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other-than-temporary. Management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline, in addition to the reasons underlying the decline, to determine whether the loss in value is other-than-temporary. The term other-than-temporary\u201d is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospect for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment. For equity securities, once a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary, the value of the equity security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized.\nThe Company follows the accounting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 320-10 as it relates to the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d). This accounting guidance specifies that (a) if a company does not have the intent to sell a debt security prior to recovery and (b) it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the debt security prior to recovery, the security would not be considered other-than-temporarily impaired unless there is a credit loss. When an entity does not intend to sell the security, and it is more likely than not, the entity will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, it will recognize the credit component of an other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income. For held to maturity debt securities, the amount of an other-than-temporary impairment recorded in other comprehensive income for the non-credit portion of a previous other-than-temporary impairment should be amortized prospectively over the remaining life of the security on the basis of the timing of future estimated cash flows of the security.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nQNB considers that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies. The allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb probable known and inherent losses in the outstanding loan portfolio. The allowance is reduced by actual credit losses and is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries of previous losses. The provisions for loan losses are charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered necessary by management.\nThe allowance for loan losses is based on management's continual review and evaluation of the loan portfolio. The level of the allowance is determined by assigning specific reserves to individually identified problem credits and general reserves to all other loans. The portion of the allowance that is allocated to impaired loans is determined by estimating the inherent loss on each credit after giving consideration to the value of underlying collateral. The general reserves are based on the composition and risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, including the nature of the loan portfolio, credit concentration trends, delinquency and loss experience, as well as other qualitative factors such as current economic trends.\nManagement emphasizes loan quality and close monitoring of potential problem credits. Credit risk identification and review processes are utilized in order to assess and monitor the degree of risk in the loan portfolio. QNB's lending and credit administration staff are charged with reviewing the loan portfolio and identifying changes in the economy or in a borrower's circumstances which may affect the ability to repay debt or the value of pledged collateral. A loan classification and review system exists that identifies those loans with a higher than normal risk of collection. Each commercial loan is assigned a grade based upon an assessment of the borrower's financial capacity to service the debt and the presence and value of collateral for the loan. An independent loan review group tests risk assessments and evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Management meets monthly to review the credit quality of the loan portfolio and quarterly to review the allowance for loan losses.\nIn addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review QNB's allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require QNB to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Management believes that it uses the best information available to make determinations about the adequacy of the allowance and that it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with GAAP. If circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making determinations, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be affected. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, increases to the allowance may be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above.\n- 47 -\nForeclosed Assets\nAssets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Revenue and expenses and changes in the valuation allowance are included in net expenses from foreclosed assets.\nStock-Based Compensation\nAt December 31, 2016, QNB sponsored stock-based compensation plans, administered by a Board committee, under which both qualified and nonqualified stock options may be granted periodically to certain employees. QNB accounts for all awards granted under stock-based compensation plans in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Compensation cost has been measured using the fair value of an award on the grant date and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. The fair value of each option is amortized into compensation expense on a straight-line basis between the grant date for the option and each vesting date. QNB estimates the fair value of stock options on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model requires the use of numerous assumptions, many of which are highly subjective in nature.\nIncome Taxes\nQNB accounts for income taxes under the asset/liability method in accordance with income tax accounting guidance, ASC 740 - Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when, in the judgment of management, it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not become available. Because the judgment about the level of future taxable income is dependent to a great extent on matters that may, at least in part, be beyond QNB's control, it is at least reasonably possible that management's judgment about the need for a valuation allowance for deferred taxes could change in the near term.", "summary": "The management's discussion and analysis report provides an overview of QNB Corp's financial condition and results of operations. The primary source of operating income for QNB is net interest income, which increased by $1,135,000 in 2016 compared to the previous year. The report also highlights changes in non-interest income, non-interest expense, loans receivable, and deposits.

Net interest income is interest income, dividends, and fees on earning assets, less interest expense incurred for funding sources. Earning assets primarily include loans, investment securities and interest bearing balances at the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed). Sources used to fund these assets include deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates, the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the amount of earning assets funded by non-interest bearing deposits.\nFor purposes of this discussion, interest income and the average yield earned on loans and investment securities are adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis as detailed in the table that appears above. This adjustment to interest income is made for analysis purposes only. Interest income is increased by the amount of savings of Federal income taxes, which QNB realizes by investing in certain tax-exempt state and municipal securities and by making loans to certain tax-exempt organizations. In this way, the ultimate economic impact of earnings from various assets can be more easily compared.\nThe net interest rate spread is the difference between average rates received on earning assets and average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, while the net interest margin, which includes interest-free sources of funds, is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The Asset/Liability and Investment Management Committee works to manage and maximize the net interest margin for the Company.\n2016 versus 2015\nOn a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2016 increased $991,000, or 3.4%, to $30,145,000. The net interest margin, which declined to 3.03% was negatively impacted by declining yields on earning assets resulting from the prolonged low interest rate environment. The average rate earned on earning assets declined three basis points from 3.53% for 2015 to 3.50% for 2016 with the yield on loans declining by five basis points while the yield on investment securities remained steady at 2.42%. In comparison, the interest rate paid on total average interest-bearing liabilities increased by one basis point from 0.56% for 2015 to 0.57% for 2016 with the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increasing from 0.57% to 0.58% for the same time period, respectively.\nNet interest income and net interest margin continue to be negatively impacted by declining yields on earning assets resulting from the prolonged low interest rate environment that banks have been operating in since 2008. At the beginning of this low interest rate cycle, funding costs declined at a faster pace and to a greater degree than rates on earning assets, resulting in an increasing net interest margin. However, this trend has reversed as funding costs have approached bottom while yields on earning assets continue to reprice lower, resulting in a decline in the net interest margin, despite two Federal Funds rate increases of 25 basis points each in December 2015 and 2016. The competitive local interest rate market for quality loans has also negatively impacted net interest income and net interest margin. Partially offsetting the impact of declining yields on earning assets was growth in earning assets, primarily loans. Average earning assets increased by $41,265,000, or 4.3%, to $995,846,000 for 2016, with average loans increasing $30,701,000, or 5.3%, to $605,040,000, while average investment securities increased $4,337,000, or 1.2%, to $359,310,000. However, with the growth in earning assets occurring primarily in the loan portfolio, the mix of earning assets changed, which also contributed to relative stability of the net interest margin, as investment securities generally earn a lower yield than loans. The growth in earning assets was also funded by a $28,740,000, or 3.3%, increase in average total deposits to $892,541,000, and the increase in short-term borrowing, primarily sweep accounts structured as repurchase agreements with our commercial customers, of $8,289,000, or 26.0%.\n2015 versus 2014\nOn a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2015 increased $1,125,000, or 4.0%, to $29,154,000, with net interest margin declining two basis points, for the reasons detailed in the discussion above. The average rate earned on earning assets declined four basis points from 3.57% for 2014 to 3.53% for 2015, with the yield on loans declining by eleven basis points while the yield on investment securities decreased five basis points. In comparison, the interest rate paid on total average interest-bearing liabilities declined two basis points from 0.58% for 2014 to 0.56% for 2015, with the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits declining from 0.58% to 0.57% over the same time period.\n- 20 -\nAverage Balances, Rates, and Interest Income and Expense Summary (Tax-Equivalent Basis)\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.
