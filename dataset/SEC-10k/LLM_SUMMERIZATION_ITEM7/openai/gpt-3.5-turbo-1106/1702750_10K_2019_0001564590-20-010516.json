Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this report. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d. Byline assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and to general practices within the Banking industry. To prepare financial statements and interim financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates, assumptions and judgments based on available information. These estimates, assumptions and judgments affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes; and are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. As this information changes, actual results could differ from the estimates, assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements. In particular, management has identified several accounting policies that, due to the estimates, assumptions and judgements inherent in those policies, are critical in understanding our financial statements.\nThese critical accounting policies and estimates include (i) acquisition-related fair value computations, (ii) the carrying value of loans and leases, (iii) determining the provision and allowance for loan and lease losses, (iv) the valuation of intangible assets such as goodwill, servicing assets and core deposit intangibles, (v) the determination of fair value for financial instruments, including other-than-temporary-impairment losses, (vi) the valuation of real estate held for sale and (vii) the valuation of or recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe JOBS Act permits us an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards affecting public companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period, which means that the financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as any financial statements that we file in the future, will not be subject to all new or revised accounting standards generally applicable to public companies for the transition period for so long as we remain an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided for under the JOBS Act.\nThe following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and significant estimates that require us to make complex and subjective judgments. Additional information about these policies can be found in Note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report.\nBusiness combinations\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations ( ASC 805\u201d). We recognize the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition, with any excess of the fair value of consideration provided over the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Application of the acquisition method requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgements to determine the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.\nIn accordance with ASC 805, the acquiring company retains the right to make appropriate adjustments to the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity for information obtained during the measurement period about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The measurement period ends as of the earlier of (i) one year from the acquisition date or (ii) the date when the acquirer receives the information necessary to complete the business combination accounting.\nCarrying value of loans and leases\nOur accounting methods for loans and leases differ depending on whether they are new or acquired loans and leases; and for acquired loans, whether the loans were acquired at a discount as a result of credit deterioration since the date of origination.\nOriginated loans and leases\nWe account for originated loans and leases and purchased loans and leases not acquired through business combinations as originated loans and leases. The new loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any allowance for loan and lease losses, unamortized deferred fees and costs and unamortized premiums or discounts. The net amount of nonrefundable loan origination fees and certain direct costs associated with the lending process are deferred and amortized to interest income over the contractual lives of the new loans using methods which approximate the level yield method. Discounts and premiums are amortized or accreted to interest income over the estimated term of the new loans using methods that approximate the effective yield method. Interest income on new loans is accrued based on the unpaid principal balance outstanding. Additionally, once an acquired non-impaired loan reaches its contractual maturity date, it is re-underwritten, and if renewed, it is classified as an originated loan.\nAcquired loans and leases\nAcquired loans and leases are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value; therefore, an allowance for loan and lease losses is not recorded at the acquisition date. Acquired loans are evaluated upon acquisition and classified as either acquired impaired or acquired non-impaired. Acquired impaired loans reflect evidence of credit deterioration since origination for which it is probable that all contractually required principal and interest will not be collected by us. Subsequent to acquisition, we periodically update for changes in cash flow expectations, which are reflected in interest income over the life of the loan as accretable yield. Any subsequent decreases in expected cash flow attributable to credit deterioration are recognized by recording a provision for loan losses.\nFor acquired non-impaired loans and leases, the excess or deficit of the loan and lease principal balance over the fair value is recorded as a discount or premium at acquisition and is accreted through interest income over the life of the loan or lease. Subsequent to acquisition, these loans and leases are evaluated for credit deterioration and a provision for loan and lease losses would be recorded when probable loss is incurred. These loans and leases are evaluated for impairment consistent with originated loans and leases.\nProvision and allowance for loan and lease losses\nThe provision for loan and lease losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses ( ALLL\u201d) at an appropriate level based upon management's evaluation of the adequacy of general and specific loss reserves.\nThe ALLL is maintained at a level that management believes is appropriate to provide for known and inherent incurred loan and lease losses as of the dates of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, and we have established methodologies for the determination of its adequacy. The methodologies are set forth in a formal policy and take into consideration the need for an overall general valuation allowance as well as specific allowances that are determined on an individual loan basis. We increase our ALLL by charging provisions for probable losses against our income and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries.\nThe evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans and leases, changes in economic or other conditions may necessitate revision of the estimate in future periods.\nThe ALLL is maintained at a level management believes is sufficient to provide for probable losses based upon an ongoing review of the originated and acquired non-impaired loan and lease portfolios by portfolio category, which include consideration of actual loss experience, peer loss experience, changes in the size and risk profile of the portfolio, identification of individual problem loan and lease situations which may affect a borrower's ability to repay, and evaluation of prevailing economic conditions.\nFor acquired impaired loans, a specific valuation allowance is established when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all of the cash flows expected at acquisition, plus the additional cash flows expected to be collected arising from changes in estimates after acquisition.\nThe originated and non-impaired acquired loans have experienced increasing delinquency and credit loss history that have trended upward, primarily in the U.S. government guaranteed portfolio. The credit quality of loans in these loan portfolios are impacted by delinquency status and debt service coverage generated by the borrowers' businesses and fluctuations in the value of real estate collateral.\nAcquired non-impaired loans and originated loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due, according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements. All acquired non-impaired loans and originated loans of $100,000 or greater with an internal risk rating of substandard or below, or on nonaccrual, as well as loans classified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDR\u201d), are reviewed individually for impairment on a quarterly basis.\nGoodwill and intangible assets\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with our recapitalization and acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized but is periodically evaluated for impairment under the provisions of ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350\u201d).\nImpairment testing is performed using either a qualitative or quantitative approach at the reporting unit level. Our goodwill is allocated to Byline Bank, which is our only applicable reporting unit for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. We have selected November 30 as the date to perform the annual goodwill impairment test. Additionally, we perform a goodwill impairment evaluation on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate impairment potentially exists.\nServicing assets. Servicing assets are recognized separately when they are acquired through sales of loans or when the rights to service loans are purchased. When loans are sold with servicing rights retained, servicing assets are recorded at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing ( ASC 860\u201d). Fair value is based on market prices for comparable servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The fair value of servicing rights is highly sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions. Changes in the prepayment speed and discount rate assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of servicing rights. See Note 7 and Note 18 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nCore deposit intangible assets. Other intangible assets primarily consist of core deposit intangible assets. In valuing core deposit intangibles, we consider variables such as deposit servicing costs, attrition rates and market discount rates. Core deposit intangibles are reviewed annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. If the recoverable amount of the core deposit intangibles is determined to be less than its carrying value, we would then measure the amount of impairment based on an estimate of the fair value at that time. We also evaluate whether the events or circumstances have occurred that warrant a revision to the remaining useful lives of intangible assets. In cases where a revision is deemed appropriate, the remaining carrying amounts of the intangible assets are amortized over the revised remaining useful life. Core deposit intangibles are currently amortized over an approximate ten year period.\nCustomer relationship intangible. Other intangible assets also include our customer relationship intangible asset. In valuing our customer relationship intangibles, we consider variables such as assets under management, attrition rates, and fee structure. Customer relationship intangibles are currently amortized over a 12 year period.\nFair value of financial instruments\nASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement.\nSee Note 18 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for a complete discussion of our use of fair value of financial assets and liabilities and their related measurement practices.\nValuation of real estate held for sale\nOther real estate owned (OREO). OREO includes real estate assets that have been acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure or repossession and are to be sold. OREO assets are initially recorded at fair value, less estimated costs to sell, of the collateral of the loan, on the date of foreclosure or repossession, establishing a new cost basis. Adjustments that reduce loan balances to fair value at the time of foreclosure or repossession are recognized as charge-offs in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Positive adjustments, if any, at the time of foreclosure or repossession are recognized in non-interest expense. After foreclosure or repossession, management periodically obtains new valuations and real estate or other assets may be adjusted to a lower carrying amount, determined by the fair value of the asset, less estimated costs to sell. Any subsequent write-downs are recorded as a decrease in the asset and charged against other real estate owned valuation adjustments, included within non-interest expense. Operating expenses of such properties, net of related income, are included in non-interest expense, and gains and losses on their disposition are included in non-interest expense. Gains on internally financed other real estate owned sales are accounted for in accordance with the methods stated in ASC Topic 360-20, Real Estate Sales ( ASC 360-20\u201d). Any losses on the sales of other real estate owned properties are recognized immediately.\nAssets held for sale. Assets held for sale consist of former branch locations and real estate purchased for expansion. Assets are considered held for sale when management has approved a plan to sell the assets following a branch closure or other events. The properties are being actively marketed and transferred to assets held for sale based at the lower of its carrying value or its fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Adjustments to reduce the asset balances to fair value are recorded at the time of transfer and are recognized through a charge against income. An assessment of the recoverability of other long-lived assets associated with all branches is periodically performed, resulting in impairment losses which are reflected in other non-interest expense.\nIncome taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. The objective of the asset and liability method is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the income tax basis of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and available tax planning opportunities. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties.\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss carryforwards. We review our deferred tax positions quarterly for changes which may impact realizability. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. We use short and long-range business forecasts to provide additional information for its evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets. It is our policy to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions, if applicable, as components of non-interest expense.\nA deferred tax valuation allowance is established to reduce the net carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is determined to be more likely than not that all or some of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. See Note 11 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for further information on income taxes.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, including the effective dates of adoption and anticipated effects on our results of operations and finance as condition, see Note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report.\nPrimary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Business\nAs a financial institution, we manage and evaluate various aspects of both our results of operations and our financial condition. We evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our consolidated financial statements as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry. We analyze these ratios and financial trends against our own historical performance, our budgeted performance and the final condition and performance of comparable financial institutions in our region. Comparison of our financial performance against other financial institutions is impacted by the accounting for acquired non-impaired and acquired impaired loans.\nThese factors and metrics described in this annual report on Form 10-K may not provide an appropriate basis to compare our results or financial condition to the results or financial condition of other financial services companies, given our limited operating history and strategic acquisitions since our recapitalization.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nOur results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of interest income on loans and lease receivables, including accretion income on loans, investment securities and other short-term investments and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits and borrowings. Our results of operations are also dependent upon our generation of non-interest income, consisting primarily of income from fees and service charges on deposits, loan servicing revenue, wealth management and trust income, ATM and interchange fees, and net gains on sales of investment securities and loans. Other factors contributing to our results of operations include our provisions for loan and lease losses, provision for income taxes, and non-interest expenses, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses and other miscellaneous operating costs.\nWe reported consolidated net income of $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to net income of $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $15.8 million. The increase in net income was attributable to a $37.7 million increase in net interest income and a $5.0 million increase in non-interest income, offset by a $6.0 million increase in provision for income taxes, a $18.9 million increase in non-interest expense, and a $1.9 million increase in provision for loan and lease losses. The increase in net interest income during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily a result of our recent acquisitions, organic loan and lease growth, and security purchases, offset by increases in the costs of interest-bearing deposits and increases in average FHLB advances during the current period. The increase in non-interest income was primarily driven by a decreased downward loan servicing asset revaluation, security sales during the period, an increase in the fair value of equity securities, net, and the acquisitions. The increase in provision for income taxes was mostly driven by an increase in net income before provision for income taxes during the period. The increase in non-interest expense was mainly due to additional costs associated with the acquisitions, primarily salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by a decrease in data processing of $4.5 million resulting from the core system conversion charges incurred in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in provision for loan and lease losses was mainly driven by increases in the general reserves driven by loan and lease originations.\nWe reported consolidated net income of $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to net income of $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $19.5 million. The increase in net income was attributable to a $55.7 million increase in net interest income, a $4.9 million decrease in provision for income taxes, and a $1.5 million increase in non-interest income, offset by a $36.4 million increase in non-interest expense and a $6.1 million increase in provision for loan and lease losses. The increase in net interest income during the year ended December 31, 2018 was a result of the First Evanston acquisition, organic loan growth, and recent market interest rate increases, slightly offset by increases in interest-bearing deposit costs during the current period. The decrease in provision for income taxes was primarily driven by the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets resulting from federal tax reform during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in non-interest income was primarily driven by increased fees and service charges as well as wealth management and trust income as a result of the First Evanston acquisition. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $13.1 million due to organizational growth as a result of the First Evanston acquisition, an increase in data processing of $8.7 million due to expenses incurred in 2018 related to the core banking system conversion we completed in the first quarter of 2019, and an increase in legal, audit and other professional fees of $4.3 million partially due to merger-related expenses. The increase in provision for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by new loan and lease originations.\nDividends declared and paid on preferred shares were $783,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. During the second quarter of 2017, and in connection with our initial public offering, we agreed to repurchase all $15.0 million of our outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock for $25.5 million. The $10.5 million excess of consideration paid over the $15.0 million carrying amount of the Series A Preferred Stock was treated as a one-time dividend declaration on the Series A Preferred Stock. Both the dividend declared on the Series A Preferred Stock and the regular quarterly dividends paid on our Series B Preferred Stock are reflected in the reported net income available to common stockholders. For the year ended December 31, 2017, dividends on the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock were $11.3 million, or $0.42 per basic and $0.41 per diluted common share.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, net income available to common stockholders was $56.2 million, or $1.51 per basic and $1.48 per diluted common share, $40.4 million, or $1.21 per basic and $1.18 per diluted common share, and $10.4 million, or $0.39 per basic and $0.38 per diluted common share, respectively.\nOur results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 produced an annual return on average assets of 1.08%, 0.97% and 0.66%, and a return on average stockholders' equity of 8.05%, 7.34% and 5.08%, respectively.\nNet interest income\nNet interest income, representing interest income less interest expense, is a significant contributor to our revenues and earnings. We generate interest income from interest and dividends on interest-earning assets, which include loans, leases and investment securities we own. We incur interest expense from interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which include interest-bearing deposits, FHLB advances, junior subordinated debentures and other borrowings. To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor (i) yields on our loans and other interest-earning assets, (ii) the costs of our deposits and other funding sources, (iii) our net interest spread and (iv) our net interest margin. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as the net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because non-interest-bearing sources of funds, such as non-interest-bearing deposits and stockholders' equity, also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these non-interest-bearing sources.\nWe also recognize income from the accretable discounts associated with the purchase of interest-earning assets. Because of our recapitalization and acquisitions, we derive a portion of our interest income from the accretable discounts on acquired loans. The accretion is generally recognized over the life of the loan and is impacted by changes in expected cash flows on the loan. This accretion will continue to have an impact on our net interest income as long as loans acquired with a discount at acquisition represent a meaningful portion of our interest-earning assets. As of December 31, 2019, acquired loans with evidence of credit deterioration accounted for under ASC Topic 310-30, Accounting for Purchased Loans with Deteriorated Credit Quality, represented 6.8% of our total loan portfolio, compared to 8.0 % at December 31, 2018 and 14.4% at December 31, 2017.\nChanges in the market interest rates we earn on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing liabilities, are usually the largest drivers of periodic changes in net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income. In addition, our interest income includes the accretion of the discounts on our acquired loans, which will also affect our net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income.\nThe following tables present, for the periods indicated, information about (i) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rates; (iii) net interest income; (iv) the interest rate spread; and (v) the net interest margin. Yields have been calculated on a pre-tax basis (dollars in thousands):\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td>

interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $216.3 million, an increase of $37.7 million, or 21.1% compared to the same period in 2018. The increase in interest income of $57.9 million was principally a result of an increase in loans as a result of the acquisitions, organic loan and lease growth, and an increase in the securities portfolio. The average balance of interest-earning assets was $4.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $952.1 million, or 24.5%, compared to 2018. Interest expense increased by $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, mostly due to deposits assumed as a result of the acquisitions, increased FHLB advances to fund organic growth, and increased interest cost of interest-bearing deposits and FHLB advances resulting from higher market interest rates. Average total interest-bearing deposits increased $571.5 million, or 25.9%, and average total FHLB advances increased $74.9 million, or 20.5%, during 2019, compared to the same period in 2018.\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $178.6 million, an increase of $55.7 million, or 45.3% compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in interest income of $70.1 million was primarily a result of an increase in loans as a result of the First Evanston acquisition, organic loan and lease growth, an increase in average yield on loans and leases, and an increase in average yield on securities available-for-sale. The average balance of interest-earning assets was $3.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $898.6 million, or 30.1%, compared to 2017. Interest expense increased by $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to increased interest expense on interest-bearing deposits resulting from increased yields as a result of an increase in market interest rates, promotional time deposit campaigns, deposits assumed as part of the First Evanston merger, and FHLB advances resulting from an increase in borrowings to fund growth. Average total interest-bearing deposits increased $430.9 million, or 24.3%, and average total FHLB advances increased $112.8 million, or 44.6%, during 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.\nInterest expense on borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $12.2 million compared to $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $3.2 million, or 35.3%. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in outstanding FHLB advances in the year ended December 31, 2019, which was a result of growth in the loan and lease portfolio. Interest expense on FHLB advances for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $9.0 million compared to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.8 million, or 45.5%. Interest expense on junior subordinated debentures issued to unconsolidated trusts and other borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $3.2 million compared to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $386,000 or 13.5%. Interest expense on the line of credit for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $36,000 compared to $2,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInterest expense on borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $9.0 million compared to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.9 million, or 46.5%. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in outstanding FHLB advances in the year ended December 31, 2018, which was a result of growth in the loan and lease portfolio. Interest expense on FHLB advances for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $6.2 million compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.9 million. Interest expense on junior subordinated debentures issued to unconsolidated trusts and other borrowings for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $2.9 million. Interest expense on the line of credit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $2,000 compared to $568,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 4.47%, a decrease of 13 basis points compared to 4.60% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 14 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, while the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 40 basis points, for a decrease in the interest rate spread of 26 basis points. The main driver of the decrease was increased average interest-bearing deposit costs resulting from increased market interest rates and increased costs on FHLB advances, partially offset by increased securities yields.\nThe net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 4.60%, an increase of 49 basis points compared to 4.11% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 75 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, while the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 42 basis points, for an increase in the interest rate spread of 33 basis points. The primary driver of the increase was an increase in average loan and lease yields and an increase in loan accretion income, partially offset by an increase in average interest-bearing deposit yields resulting from rising interest rates and our time deposit promotion strategy.\nProvision for loan and lease losses\nThe provision for loan and lease losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for loan and lease losses that, in management's evaluation, is appropriate to provide coverage for probable losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio. The allowance for loan and lease losses is increased by the provision for loan and lease losses and is decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries on prior charge-offs.\nProvisions for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $20.7 million compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.9 million, or 10.2%. The increase reflects the growth in our loan portfolio, particularly the unguaranteed portion of U.S. government guaranteed loans, the migration of the acquired portfolio into the originated portfolio, and increases to our general reserves. The ALLL as a percentage of loans and leases increased from 0.72% at December 31, 2018 to 0.84% at December 31, 2019.\nProvisions for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $18.8 million compared to $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $6.1 million or 48.5%, primarily due to an increase in loans as a result of organic growth. The increase is partially due to an increase in a specific reserve on a commercial loan relationship during the first quarter of 2018, additional specific impairment in the unguaranteed portion of the U.S. government guaranteed portfolio, and an increase to the general reserve driven by growth in the originated loan and lease portfolio. The ALLL as a percentage of loans and leases decreased slightly from 0.73% at December 31, 2017 to 0.72% at December 31, 2018.\nNon-interest income\nNon-interest income was $55.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $5.0 million or 9.8%. The increase in non-interest income was mostly due to a decreased downward loan servicing asset revaluation adjustment due to changes in fair value of the servicing asset, security sales during the period, an increase in the fair value of equity securities, net, and wealth management and trust income as a result of the full year impact of the First Evanston acquisition.\nNon-interest income was $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $49.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.5 million or 3.1%. The increase in non-interest income was primarily driven by increased fees and service charges and wealth management and trust income as a result of the First Evanston acquisition, increased derivative products fee income, and increased gains on sale of former branch properties, partially offset by an increased downward loan servicing asset revaluation and decreased gains on sales of government guaranteed loans.\nThe following table presents the major components of our non-interest income for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fees and service charges on deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan servicing revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan servicing asset revaluation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,639\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,269\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,941\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ATM and interchange fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net gains on sales of securities available-for-sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of equity securities, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net gains on sales of loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wealth management and trust income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other non-interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFees and service charges on deposits represent amounts charged to customers for banking services, such as fees on deposit accounts, and include, but are not limited to, maintenance fees, insufficient fund fees, overdraft protection fees, wire transfer fees and other charges. Fees and service charges on deposits were $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $13,000, or 0.2%.\nFees and service charges on deposits were $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.2 million, or 21.9%. The increase was primarily driven by additional business deposit accounts from the First Evanston acquisition.\nWhile portions of the loans that we originate are sold and generate gains on sale revenue, servicing rights for the majority of loans that we sell are retained by us. In exchange for continuing to service loans that have been sold, we receive servicing revenue from a portion of the interest cash flow of the loan. We generated $10.7 million in loan servicing revenue on the sold portion of U.S. government guaranteed loans for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $423,000, or 4.1%. We generated $10.3 million in loan servicing revenue on the sold portion of U.S. government guaranteed loans for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $673,000 or 7.0%. The increases were primarily driven by an increase in total loans serviced due to additional U.S government guaranteed loans sold with retained servicing rights. At December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, the outstanding balances of U.S. government guaranteed loans serviced, were $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively.\nLoan servicing asset revaluation represents net changes in the fair value of our servicing assets. Loan servicing asset revaluation had a downward adjustment of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $2.6 million, or 28.4%. Loan servicing asset revaluation had a downward adjustment of $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $3.3 million or 56.0%. The variances were primarily driven by the change in fair value of the servicing asset as a result of changes to valuation assumptions, including prepayment speeds, discount rates, and expected average loan life, on U.S. government guaranteed loans based on the current interest rate environment.\nATM and interchange fees were $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $528,000 or 12.2%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower interchange income, decreased transactional account volume, and a credit card agreement signing bonus in the prior period. ATM and interchange fees were $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $499,000 or 10.4%. The decrease was primarily driven by a revision to our fee assessment schedule offset by increased interchange fees resulting from a credit card vendor agreement signing bonus.\nGains on sales of securities were $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $164,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $987,000. Gains on sales of securities were $164,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $8,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $156,000. The variances were due to fluctuations in sales volume. We sold $92.1 million, $5.1 million, and $8,000 of securities during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nChange in fair value of equity securities, net, was a $1.4 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2019. Upon adoption of new accounting guidance as of January 1, 2019, changes in fair value of equity securities are recorded through net income rather than other comprehensive income. The amount recorded during the period is a result of the increase or decrease in the fair value of these securities.\nNet gains on sales of loans were $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $294,000, or 0.9%. We sold $336.2 million of U.S. government guaranteed loans during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $320.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net gains on sales was primarily driven by increased government guaranteed loan sales volume and partially offset by decreased average premiums.\nNet gains on sales of loans were $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.5 million or 4.6%. We sold $320.5 million of U.S. government guaranteed loans during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $311.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net gains on sales was primarily driven by a decrease in average premiums.\nWealth management and trust income represents fees charged to customers for investment, trust, or wealth management services and are primarily determined by total assets under management. Wealth management and trust income was $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.0 million or 66.9%. We did not offer these services prior to the First Evanston acquisition during the second quarter of 2018. Assets under management were $568.5 million and $571.5 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by market conditions and account closures.\nOther non-interest income was $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1.3 million or 23.7%. Customer derivative products fee income was $893,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $772,000. Losses on sales of assets held for sale were $55,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a gain of $951,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, a variance of $1.0 million.\nOther non-interest income was $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $3.3 million. Customer derivative products fee income was $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $393,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, and increase of $1.3 million. Gains on sales of assets held for sale were $951,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a loss of $327,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.3 million.\nNon-interest expense\nWe reported non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $173.8 million compared to $154.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $18.9 million or 12.2%. The increase was primarily due to the additional expenses as a result of our acquisition related activity, including salaries and employee benefits, system conversion expenses, other intangible asset amortization expense, and the core system conversion completed in the first and third quarters of 2019.\nNon-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $154.9 million compared to $118.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $36.4 million or 30.7%. The increase was primarily due to the additional expenses as a result of our acquisition related activity, including salaries and employee benefits, and contract termination costs related to the core system conversion completed in the first quarter of 2019.\nThe following table presents the major components of our non-interest expense for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 95,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 80,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equipment expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan and lease related expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal, audit and other professional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data processing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss (gain) recognized on other real estate owned and other\nrelated expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (294\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Regulatory assessments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other intangible assets amortization expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advertising and promotions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Telecommunications\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other non-interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 173,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 154,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 118,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries and employee benefits expense, the single largest component of our non-interest expense, for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $95.3 million compared to $80.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $14.9 million or 18.6%, primarily due to the acquisitions. Our staffing increased from 943 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2018 to 1,001 as of December 31, 2019.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $80.4 million compared to $67.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $13.1 million or 19.5%, primarily due to increased staffing as a result of the acquisition of First Evanston. Our staffing increased from 844 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2017 to 943 as of December 31, 2018.\nOccupancy expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $16.7 million compared to $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $839,000 or 5.3%. The increase was primarily a result of our additional branches resulting from the acquisitions.

The increase was primarily a result of increased investment in equipment and technology assets. Equipment expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $2.4 million compared to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $53,000 or 2.1%. The slight decrease was primarily due to equipment moved to assets held for sale.\nLoan and lease related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $8.0 million compared to $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.9 million or 31.2%. The increase was primarily driven by additional loans and leases from organic growth and increased collection expense. Loan and lease related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $6.1 million compared to $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.4 million or 65.8%. The increase was primarily driven by increased expenses associated with U.S. government guaranteed loan sales.\nLegal, audit and other professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $11.5 million compared to $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $80,000 or 0.7%. Legal, audit and other professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $11.4 million compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $4.3 million or 61.8%. These increases were primarily driven by increased legal and professional services incurred related to our core system conversion and our recent acquisitions.\nData processing expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $13.7 million compared to $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $4.5 million or 24.7%. The decrease was primarily due to contract termination expenses during the second quarter of 2018 related to our core system conversion, which was completed during the first quarter of 2019. Data processing expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $18.2 million compared to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $8.7 million or 91.2%. The increase was primarily due to $8.1 million of contract termination\nexpenses in connection with the core system conversion and increased data processing expenses related to the First Evanston acquisition.\nNet loss recognized on other real estate owned and other related expenses were $665,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $235,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase in expense of $430,000. This variance was primarily attributed to decreased gains on sales of other real estate owned assets. Net loss recognized on other real estate owned and other related expenses was $235,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a net gain of $294,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase in expense of $529,000. This variance was primarily attributed to decreased gains on sales of other real estate owned assets during the year offset by decreased other real estate owned related expenses due to decreased inventory of properties.\nRegulatory assessments for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $697,000 compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1.0 million, or 60.0%. The decrease was primarily driven by an FDIC credit and improved financial ratios. Regulatory assessments for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1.7 million compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $551,000, or 46.2%. The increase was primarily due to our increased asset size, offset by our improved risk profile as a result of improved financial ratios and performance.\nOther intangible assets amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $7.7 million, compared to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.1 million, or 37.5%. Other intangible assets amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $5.6 million compared to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.6 million, or 83.1%. The increases were attributed to additional core deposit intangible asset amortization resulting from the acquisitions and a customer relationship intangible asset amortization as a result of the acquisitions.\nAdvertising and promotions for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $3.4 million compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.7 million or 97.1%, primarily due to an increase in advertising attributable to deposit advertising campaigns and an increase in sponsorships. Advertising and promotions for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1.7 million compared to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $688,000 or 66.5%, primarily due to an increase in advertising attributable to our core deposit advertising campaigns.\nTelecommunications expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $2.0 million compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $253,000 or 14.8%. The increase was primarily a result of our larger branch network and integration expenses partially offset by cost savings initiatives. Telecommunications expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1.7 million compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $117,000 or 7.3%.\nOther non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $11.0 million compared to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.5 million, or 16.1%. The primary drivers of the increase were increases of $1.1 million in stationery, supplies, and postage expense as well as $371,000 in messenger and protection services expense.\nOther non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $9.5 million compared to $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.7 million, or 24.4%. This includes increases of $473,000 in ATM and debit card losses, $198,000 in operational insurance expenses, and $154,000 in provision for unfunded commitments, offset by a decrease of $323,000 in impairment charges on assets held for sale. The increases can also be attributed to the First Evanston acquisition.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our efficiency ratio was 61.09%, 65.15%, and 67.13%, respectively. The improvements in our efficiency ratio were primarily attributable to the increase in our net interest income resulting from our acquisitions and organic loan and lease growth, partially offset by increased non-interest expense primarily driven by increased salary and employee benefit expenses and core system conversion expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our adjusted efficiency ratio was 58.53%, 59.68%, and 65.83%, respectively. Please refer to the GAAP Reconciliation and Management Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d included in item 6 of this report, for more information on how our adjusted efficiency ratio is calculated.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to increased income before provision for income taxes during the period.\nAs part of a budget package passed by the Legislature of the State of Illinois, the corporate income tax rate increased from 5.25% to 7.00% effective July 1, 2017. As a result of the increase in the corporate income tax rate, we recorded a state income tax benefit of $4.8 million during 2017, primarily due to increased value of our deferred tax asset related to our Illinois net loss deduction.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017, and ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d), required us to reflect the changes associated with the Tax Act's provisions in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Tax Act is complex and has extensive implications for the Company's federal and state taxes. Among other things, the Tax Act reduced the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. Also on December 22, 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the Tax Act's impact. SAB 118 provides a measurement period, not to extend beyond one year from the date of enactment. As a result of the rate change, the Company's net deferred tax assets were required to be revalued during the period in which the new legislation was enacted, and the Company recorded net income tax expense of $7.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of this change, and recorded an additional discrete income tax benefit of $760,000 during 2018.\nOur effective tax rate was 26.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, 25.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018, and 46.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017. We expect our effective tax rate for 2020 to be approximately 26% to 28%.\nFinancial Condition\nBalance sheet analysis\nOur total assets increased by $579.2 million, or 11.7%, to $5.5 billion at December 31, 2019, compared to $4.9 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase in total assets includes an increase of $284.0 million, or 8.1%, in loans and leases from $3.5 billion at December 31, 2018 to $3.8 billion at December 31, 2019. Our originated loan and lease portfolio increased by $597.9 million and our acquired loan and lease portfolio decreased by $313.8 million. The increase in our originated portfolio is mostly attributed to organic loan and lease growth and renewals of acquired non-impaired loans that are now reflected with originated loans. The decrease in our acquired portfolio is attributed to renewals reflected in originated loans, payoffs, and pay downs during the period, partially offset by the Oak Park River Forest acquisition.\nTotal liabilities increased by $479.8 million, or 11.2%, to $4.8 billion at December 31, 2019 compared to $4.3 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase is a result of an increase in total deposits of $397.7 million, or 10.6%, primarily attributed to the Oak Park River Forest acquisition, time deposit growth as a result of deposit promotions to seek to expand our retail customer base, money market growth. Federal Home Loan Bank advances increased $65.0 million, or 15.3%, due to loan and lease growth and security purchases.\nInvestment portfolio\nOur investment securities portfolio consists of securities classified as equity and other securities, at fair value, available-for-sale, and held-to-maturity. There were no securities classified as trading in our investment portfolio as of or for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. All available-for sale securities are carried at fair value and may be used for liquidity purposes should management consider it to be in our best interest. Securities available-for-sale consist primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government agencies securities.\nSecurities available-for-sale increased $368.6 million, or 45.1%, from $817.7 million at December 31, 2018 to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributed to securities purchases and the adoption of the provisions of ASU No. 2017-12 during the year. Upon adoption, we elected to reclassify $94.8 million of securities held-to-maturity to securities available-for-sale. Additionally, we acquired $30.3 million of available-for-sale securities upon the acquisition of Oak Park River Forest, and there were additional purchases of agency, mortgage-backed, corporate, and U.S. Treasury securities during the year.\nOur held-to-maturity securities portfolio consists of mortgage-backed securities and obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions. We carry these securities at amortized cost. Securities held-to-maturity decreased $94.9 million, or 95.6%, from $99.3 million at December 31, 2018 to $4.4 million at December 31, 2019. This decrease was due to the adoption of ASU No. 2017-12, as discussed above.\nThe fair value of our equity and other securities portfolio was $8.0 million at December 31, 2019. We adopted the provisions of ASU No 2016-01 on January 1, 2019, which require changes in the value of certain equity securities and mutual fund investments to be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These securities were included in the available-for-sale portfolio as of December 31, 2018.\nWe had no securities that were classified as having other-than-temporary-impairment ( OTTI\u201d) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe following tables summarize the fair value of the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolio as of the dates presented (dollars in thousands):\nTable

securities have fair values less than amortized cost and, therefore, contain unrealized losses. At December 31, 2019, we evaluated the securities which had an unrealized loss for OTTI and determined all declines in value to be temporary. There were 99 investment securities with unrealized losses at December 31, 2019. We anticipate full recovery of amortized cost with respect to these securities by maturity, or sooner in the event of a more favorable market interest rate environment. We do not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell them before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.\nThe following tables (dollars in thousands) set forth certain information regarding contractual maturities and the weighted average yields of our investment securities as of the dates presented.

December 31, 2018.\nThere were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, with total outstanding balances greater than 10% of our stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nRestricted stock\nAs a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, Byline Bank is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB. No market exists for this stock, and it has no quoted market value. The stock is redeemable at par by the FHLB and is, therefore, carried at cost. In addition, Byline Bank owns stock of Bankers' Bank, which is redeemable at par and carried at cost. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we held $22.1 million and $19.2 million, respectively, in FHLB and Bankers' Bank stock. We evaluate impairment of our investment in FHLB and Bankers' Bank based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value. We did not identify any indicators of impairment of FHLB and Bankers' Bank stock as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nLoan and lease portfolio\nLending-related income is the most important component of our net interest income and is the main driver of the results of our operations. Total loans and leases at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $3.8 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, an increase of $284.0 million or 8.1%. The growth in the originated loan and lease portfolio was primarily driven by increases in commercial and industrial loans and leases. The decrease in the acquired loan and lease portfolio was driven by renewals that are reflected within originated loans, payoffs, and maturities during the period, partially offset by loans acquired as a result of the Oak Park River Forest acquisition.\nWe strive to maintain a relatively diversified loan portfolio to help reduce the risk inherent in concentration in certain types of collateral.

at fixed rates and 52.5% at floating rates. The expected life of our loan portfolio will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to curtail or prepay their loans with or without penalties. Because a portion of the portfolio is accounted for under ASC 310-30, the carrying value is significantly affected by estimates and it is impracticable to allocate scheduled payments for those loans based on those estimates. Consequently, the tables presented include information limited to contractual maturities of the underlying loans.\nAllowance for loan and lease losses\nThe ALLL is determined by us on a quarterly basis, although we are engaged in monitoring the appropriate level of the allowance on a more frequent basis. The ALLL reflects management's estimate of probable incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolios. The computation includes elements of judgement and high levels of subjectivity.\nFactors considered by us include, but are not limited to, actual loss experience, peer loss experience, changes in size and risk profile of the portfolio, identification of individual problem loan and lease situations which may affect a borrower's ability to repay, and evaluation of the prevailing economic conditions. Changes in conditions may necessitate revision of the estimate in future periods.\nWe assess the ALLL based on three categories: (i) originated loans and leases, (ii) acquired non-impaired loans and leases and (iii) acquired impaired loans with further credit deterioration after the acquisitions or our recapitalization.\nTotal ALLL was $31.9 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $25.2 million at December 31, 2018, an increase of $6.7 million, or 26.7%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in specific impairments in the unguaranteed portion of the U.S. government guaranteed portfolio and an increase in the general reserve driven by newly originated loans and leases and renewals of acquired non-impaired loans that are also reflected within originated loans and leases.\nTotal ALLL to total loans and leases held for investment, net before ALLL was 0.84% and 0.72% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in impaired loans and specific impairments in the unguaranteed portion of the U.S. government guaranteed loans.\nThe following table presents an analysis of the allowance of the loan and lease losses for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Commercial\nReal Estate\n</td>

</tr>\n</table>\nNon-performing assets\nNon-performing loans and leases include loans and leases 90 days past due and still accruing, loans and leases accounted for on a non-accrual basis and accruing restructured loans. Non-performing assets consist of non-performing loans and leases plus other real estate owned. Non-accrual loans and leases as December 31, 2019 and 2018 totaled $36.3 million and $25.8 million, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by downgrades in the U.S. government guaranteed loan portfolio and a commercial relationship. Non-performing assets consisted of $4.2 million and $4.6 million of U.S. government guaranteed balances at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nTotal OREO increased from $5.0 million as of December 31, 2018 to $9.9 million at December 31, 2019. The $4.9 million increase in OREO resulted primarily from net additions of $2.2 million to OREO as a result of the Oak Park River Forest acquisition, and loan foreclosures and deeds in lieu of loan foreclosures totaling $5.9 million, partially offset by dispositions of $3.2 million, and valuation adjustments of $511,000.\nThe following table sets forth the amounts of non-performing loans and leases, non-performing assets, and OREO at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-performing assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-accrual loans and leases(1)(2)(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Past due loans and leases 90 days or more and still\naccruing interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accruing troubled debt restructured loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing loans and leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other real estate owned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing loans and leases as a percentage of total\nloans and leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.79\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing assets as a percentage of\ntotal assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.87\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.67\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of\nnon-performing loans and leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83.95\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91.15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-performing loans guaranteed by U.S.\ngovernment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-accrual loans guaranteed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Past due loans 90 days or more and still accruing interest\nguaranteed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accruing troubled debt restructured loans guaranteed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing loans guaranteed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing loans and leases not guaranteed as\na percentage of total loans and leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.89\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.66\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing assets not guaranteed as a\npercentage of total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.79\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.57\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Includes $8.8 million and $7.3 million of non-accrual restructured loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> For the year ended December 31, 2019, $2.5 million in interest income would have been recorded had non-accrual loans been current.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> For the year ended December 31, 2019, $507,000 in interest income would have been recorded had troubled debt restructurings included within non-accrual loans been current.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquired impaired loans (accounted for under ASC 310-30) that are delinquent and/or on non-accrual status continue to accrue income provided the respective pool in which those assets reside maintains a discount and recognizes accretion income. The aforementioned loans are characterized as performing loans based on contractual delinquency. If the pool no longer has a discount and accretion income can no longer be recognized, any loan within that pool on non-accrual status will be classified as non-accrual for presentation purposes.\nTotal non-accrual loans increased by $10.4 million between December 31, 2019 and 2018 due to additional non-accrual loans primarily from the downgrades of U.S. government guaranteed loans and a commercial relationship. The U.S. government guaranteed portion of non-performing loans totaled $4.2 million and $4.6 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nTotal accruing loans past due increased from $24.5 million at December 31, 2018 to $40.2 million at December 31, 2019. This represents an increase of $15.7 million, or 64.2%, and can be attributed to increases in commercial real estate and construction, land development, and other land loans. See Note 6 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for further information.\nDeposits\nWe gather deposits primarily through each of our 56 branch locations in the Chicago metropolitan area and one branch in Brookfield, Wisconsin. Through our branch network, online, mobile and direct banking channels, we offer a variety of deposit products including demand deposit accounts, interest-bearing products, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit. We offer competitive online, mobile and direct banking channels. Small businesses are a significant source of low cost deposits as they value convenience, flexibility and access to local decision makers that are responsive to their needs. Deposits assumed from the Oak Park River Forest and First Evanston acquisitions were recorded at fair value using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805.\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2019 were $4.1 billion, representing an increase of $397.7 million, or 10.6%, compared to $3.7 billion at December 31, 2018. Non-interest-bearing deposits were $1.3 billion, or 30.9% of total deposits, at December 31, 2019, an increase of $86.8 million, or 7.3%, compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2018, or 31.8% of total deposits. Core deposits were 83.1% and 81.7% of total deposits at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe following tables show the average balance amounts and the average contractual rates paid on our deposits for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest-bearing demand deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,238,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,002,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest checking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 346,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.58\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 260,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.37\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Money market accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 709,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 522,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.74\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Savings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 474,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.09\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 465,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits (below $100,000)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 490,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.88\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 418,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.26\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits ($100,000 and above)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 753,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.33\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 535,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.64\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,012,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.91\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,205,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.60\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in time deposits was driven by promotional campaigns during the year ended December 31, 2019. Our average cost of deposits was 91 basis points during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 60 basis points during the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily attributed to higher rates on interest-bearing deposits as a result of local competition and the interest rate environment. We had $41.0 million and $50.0 million of brokered time deposits as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe following table shows time deposits and other time deposits of $100,000 or more by time remaining until maturity (dollars in thousands):\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> At December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Three months or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 326,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over three months through six months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 186,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over six months through 12 months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 141,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over 12 months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 702,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBorrowed funds\nIn addition to deposits, we also utilize FHLB advances as a supplementary funding source to finance our operations. The bank's advances from the FHLB are collateralized by residential and multi-family real estate loans and securities. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had maximum borrowing capacity from the FHLB of $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, subject to the availability of collateral. During the year ended December 31, 2019, outstanding FHLB advances increased to $490.0 million from $425.0 million at December 31, 2018, resulting from asset growth.\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding our short-term borrowings at the dates and for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal Home Loan Bank advances:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average balance outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 440,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 365,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 252,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maximum outstanding at any month-end period during\nthe year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 550,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 460,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 361,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance outstanding at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 490,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 425,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 361,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate during period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.03\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.69\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.30\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.70\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.56\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.49\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Line of credit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average balance outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maximum outstanding at any month-end period during\nthe year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance outstanding at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate during period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.39\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.92\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate at end of period(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> We amended the credit agreement, which extended the maturity date to October, 2020.

If we fail to provide timely notification, the interest rate will be Prime Rate minus 75 basis points.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2019, FHLB advances have maturities ranging from January 2020 to March 2020.\nCustomer repurchase agreements (sweeps)\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase represent a demand deposit product offered to customers that sweep balances in excess of the FDIC insurance limit into overnight repurchase agreements. We pledge securities as collateral for the repurchase agreements. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased by $15.5 million from $34.2 million at December 31, 2018 to $49.6 million at December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity\nWe manage liquidity based upon factors that include the amount of core deposits as a percentage of total deposits, the level of diversification of our funding sources, the amount of non-deposit funding used to fund assets, the availability of unused funding sources, off-balance sheet obligations, the availability of assets to be readily converted into cash without undue loss, the amount of cash and liquid securities we hold and the re-pricing characteristics and maturities of our assets when compared to the re-pricing characteristics of our liabilities, the ability to securitize and sell certain pools of assets and other factors.\nOur liquidity needs are primarily met by cash and investment securities positions, growth in deposits, cash flow from amortizing loan portfolios, and borrowings from the FHLB. For additional information regarding our operating, investing, and financing cash flows, see Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\u201d in our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Byline Bank had maximum borrowing capacity from the FHLB of $1.9 billion and $547.8 million from the Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB\u201d). As of December 31, 2019, Byline Bank had open advances of $490.0 million and open letters of credit of $20.8 million, leaving us with available aggregate borrowing capacity of $1.4 billion. In addition, Byline Bank had an uncommitted federal funds line available of $115.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Byline Bank had maximum borrowing capacity from the FHLB of $1.7 billion and $293.6 million from the Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB\u201d). As of December 31, 2018, Byline Bank had open advances of $425.0 million and open letters of credit of $32.6 million, leaving us with available aggregate borrowing capacity of $1.3 billion. In addition, Byline Bank had uncommitted federal funds lines available of $55.0 million.\nOn October 13, 2016, we entered into a $30.0 million revolving credit agreement with a correspondent bank. In April 2017, the revolving line of credit was amended to a non-revolving line of credit as long as the outstanding balance exceeds $5.0 million. When the outstanding balance was reduced to $5.0 million, the line of credit was converted to a revolving line of credit with credit availability up to $5.0 million until maturity. In July 2017, we repaid the outstanding balance, in full, under this line of credit of $16.2 million with proceeds from our initial public offering. On April 30, 2019, we drew on the line of credit for $5.7 million and selected the LIBOR plus 225 basis points interest rate option, which was the interest rate option at the time of the draw. The funds were utilized to repay a line of credit assumed as a result of the Oak Park River Forest acquisition. We repaid the $5.7 million outstanding balance of the line of credit in full on May 31, 2019. On October 10, 2019, the Company entered into a fourth amendment to the\nrevolving credit agreement, which increased the revolving loan commitment to $15.0 million and extended the maturity of the credit facility to October 9, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, no balance was outstanding on the line of credit.\nThere are regulatory limitations that affect the ability of Byline Bank to pay dividends to the Company. See Note 21 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information. Management believes that such limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing short-term cash obligations.\nWe expect that our cash and liquidity resources will be generated by the operations of Byline Bank, which we expect to be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months.\nCapital resources\nStockholders' equity at December 31, 2019 was $750.1 million compared to $650.7 million at December 31, 2018, an increase of $99.4 million, or 15.3%. The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Oak Park River Forest, the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options, retained earnings, and a decrease to other comprehensive loss.\nThe Company and Byline Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by federal banking regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements.\nUnder applicable bank regulatory capital requirements, each of the Company and Byline Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Byline Bank must also meet certain specific capital guidelines under the prompt corrective action framework. The capital amounts and classification are subject to qualitative judgments by the federal banking regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and Byline Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets, (referred to as the leverage ratio\u201d), as defined under these capital requirements. For further information, see Item 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation-Regulatory Capital Requirements\u201d and Business-Supervision and Regulation-Prompt Corrective Action Framework.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2019, Byline Bank exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements and was considered well-capitalized.\u201d There have been no conditions or events since December 31, 2019 that management believes have changed Byline Bank's classifications.\nThe regulatory capital ratios for the Company and Byline Bank to meet the minimum capital adequacy standards and for Byline Bank to be considered well capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework and the Company's and Byline Bank's actual capital amounts and ratios are set forth in the following tables as of the periods indicated (dollars in

of CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum risk-based capital levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying discretionary bonuses. The conservation buffers for the Company and Byline Bank exceed the minimum capital requirement as of December 31, 2019.\nProvisions of state and federal banking regulations may limit, by statute, the amount of dividends that may be paid to the Company by Byline Bank without prior approval of Byline Bank's regulatory agencies. The Company is economically dependent on the cash dividends received from Byline Bank. These dividends represent the Company's primary cash flow from operating activities used to service its obligations. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company received $13.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively, in cash dividends from Byline Bank in order to pay the required interest on its outstanding junior subordinated debentures in connection with its trust preferred securities interest, dividends on the Series B preferred stock outstanding, and to fund other Company-related activities.\nOn November 1, 2019, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a program authorizing the purchase of up to an aggregate of 1,250,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. The shares may, at the discretion of management, be repurchased from time to time in open market purchases as market conditions warrant or in privately negotiated transactions, including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, all as effected to the extent permitted by applicable law, including pursuant to the safe harbor provided under Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company is not obligated to purchase any shares under the program, and the program may be discontinued at any time. The actual timing, number and share price of shares purchased under the repurchase program will be determined by the Company at its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the Company's stock, general market and economic conditions and applicable legal requirements. The shares authorized to be repurchased represent approximately 3.3% of the Company's currently outstanding common stock. Shares repurchased, if any, would be available for issuance under the Company's equity incentive plans and for other general corporate purposes. The program will be in effect until December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier.\nOn December 12, 2019, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared the first cash dividend on its common stock of $0.03 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019, which totaled $1.1 million. The dividend was paid on January 7, 2020 to stockholders of record on December 24, 2019.\nContractual obligations\nThe following table presents our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019.

These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The contractual or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by Byline Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral is primarily obtained in the form of commercial and residential real estate (including income producing commercial properties).\nLetters of credit are conditional commitments issued by Byline Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, bond financing and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers.\nCommitments to make loans are generally made for periods of 90 days or less. The fixed rate loan commitments have interest rates ranging from 2.50% to 19.50% and maturities up to 2043. Variable rate loan commitments have interest rates ranging from 2.75% to 10.00% and maturities up to 2048.\nOur exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as for funded instruments. We do not anticipate any material losses as a result of the commitments and standby letters of credit.\nWe enter into interest rate swaps that are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to certain variable rate borrowings. We also enter into interest rate derivatives with certain qualified borrowers to facilitate the borrowers' risk management strategies and concurrently entered into mirror-image derivatives with a third party counterparty.\nWe recognize derivative financial instruments at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the instrument. We record derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition within other assets and other liabilities, respectively. See Note 22 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information. Because the derivative assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2019 do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts, these assets and liabilities are listed in the table below (dollars in thousands):\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Notional\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest rate contracts-pay fixed, receive floating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other interest rate swaps-pay fixed, receive floating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 332,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other credit derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "summary": "The report provides an overview of the company's financial condition and results of operations.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this report. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d. Byline assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and to general practices within the Banking industry. To prepare financial statements and interim financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates, assumptions and judgments based on available information. These estimates, assumptions and judgments affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes; and are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. As this information changes, actual results could differ from the estimates, assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements. In particular, management has identified several accounting policies that, due to the estimates, assumptions and judgements inherent in those policies, are critical in understanding our financial statements.\nThese critical accounting policies and estimates include (i) acquisition-related fair value computations, (ii) the carrying value of loans and leases, (iii) determining the provision and allowance for loan and lease losses, (iv) the valuation of intangible assets such as goodwill, servicing assets and core deposit intangibles, (v) the determination of fair value for financial instruments, including other-than-temporary-impairment losses, (vi) the valuation of real estate held for sale and (vii) the valuation of or recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe JOBS Act permits us an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards affecting public companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period, which means that the financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as any financial statements that we file in the future, will not be subject to all new or revised accounting standards generally applicable to public companies for the transition period for so long as we remain an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided for under the JOBS Act.\nThe following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and significant estimates that require us to make complex and subjective judgments. Additional information about these policies can be found in Note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report.\nBusiness combinations\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations ( ASC 805\u201d). We recognize the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition, with any excess of the fair value of consideration provided over the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Application of the acquisition method requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgements to determine the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.\nIn accordance with ASC 805, the acquiring company retains the right to make appropriate adjustments to the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity for information obtained during the measurement period about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The measurement period ends as of the earlier of (i) one year from the acquisition date or (ii) the date when the acquirer receives the information necessary to complete the business combination accounting.\nCarrying value of loans and leases\nOur accounting methods for loans and leases differ depending on whether they are new or acquired loans and leases; and for acquired loans, whether the loans were acquired at a discount as a result of credit deterioration since the date of origination.\nOriginated loans and leases\nWe account for originated loans and leases and purchased loans and leases not acquired through business combinations as originated loans and leases. The new loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any allowance for loan and lease losses, unamortized deferred fees and costs and unamortized premiums or discounts. The net amount of nonrefundable loan origination fees and certain direct costs associated with the lending process are deferred and amortized to interest income over the contractual lives of the new loans using methods which approximate the level yield method. Discounts and premiums are amortized or accreted to interest income over the estimated term of the new loans using methods that approximate the effective yield method. Interest income on new loans is accrued based on the unpaid principal balance outstanding. Additionally, once an acquired non-impaired loan reaches its contractual maturity date, it is re-underwritten, and if renewed, it is classified as an originated loan.\nAcquired loans and leases\nAcquired loans and leases are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value; therefore, an allowance for loan and lease losses is not recorded at the acquisition date. Acquired loans are evaluated upon acquisition and classified as either acquired impaired or acquired non-impaired. Acquired impaired loans reflect evidence of credit deterioration since origination for which it is probable that all contractually required principal and interest will not be collected by us. Subsequent to acquisition, we periodically update for changes in cash flow expectations, which are reflected in interest income over the life of the loan as accretable yield. Any subsequent decreases in expected cash flow attributable to credit deterioration are recognized by recording a provision for loan losses.\nFor acquired non-impaired loans and leases, the excess or deficit of the loan and lease principal balance over the fair value is recorded as a discount or premium at acquisition and is accreted through interest income over the life of the loan or lease. Subsequent to acquisition, these loans and leases are evaluated for credit deterioration and a provision for loan and lease losses would be recorded when probable loss is incurred. These loans and leases are evaluated for impairment consistent with originated loans and leases.\nProvision and allowance for loan and lease losses\nThe provision for loan and lease losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses ( ALLL\u201d) at an appropriate level based upon management's evaluation of the adequacy of general and specific loss reserves.\nThe ALLL is maintained at a level that management believes is appropriate to provide for known and inherent incurred loan and lease losses as of the dates of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, and we have established methodologies for the determination of its adequacy. The methodologies are set forth in a formal policy and take into consideration the need for an overall general valuation allowance as well as specific allowances that are determined on an individual loan basis. We increase our ALLL by charging provisions for probable losses against our income and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries.\nThe evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans and leases, changes in economic or other conditions may necessitate revision of the estimate in future periods.\nThe ALLL is maintained at a level management believes is sufficient to provide for probable losses based upon an ongoing review of the originated and acquired non-impaired loan and lease portfolios by portfolio category, which include consideration of actual loss experience, peer loss experience, changes in the size and risk profile of the portfolio, identification of individual problem loan and lease situations which may affect a borrower's ability to repay, and evaluation of prevailing economic conditions.\nFor acquired impaired loans, a specific valuation allowance is established when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all of the cash flows expected at acquisition, plus the additional cash flows expected to be collected arising from changes in estimates after acquisition.\nThe originated and non-impaired acquired loans have experienced increasing delinquency and credit loss history that have trended upward, primarily in the U.S. government guaranteed portfolio. The credit quality of loans in these loan portfolios are impacted by delinquency status and debt service coverage generated by the borrowers' businesses and fluctuations in the value of real estate collateral.\nAcquired non-impaired loans and originated loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due, according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements. All acquired non-impaired loans and originated loans of $100,000 or greater with an internal risk rating of substandard or below, or on nonaccrual, as well as loans classified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDR\u201d), are reviewed individually for impairment on a quarterly basis.\nGoodwill and intangible assets\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with our recapitalization and acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized but is periodically evaluated for impairment under the provisions of ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350\u201d).\nImpairment testing is performed using either a qualitative or quantitative approach at the reporting unit level. Our goodwill is allocated to Byline Bank, which is our only applicable reporting unit for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. We have selected November 30 as the date to perform the annual goodwill impairment test. Additionally, we perform a goodwill impairment evaluation on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate impairment potentially exists.\nServicing assets. Servicing assets are recognized separately when they are acquired through sales of loans or when the rights to service loans are purchased. When loans are sold with servicing rights retained, servicing assets are recorded at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing ( ASC 860\u201d). Fair value is based on market prices for comparable servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The fair value of servicing rights is highly sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions. Changes in the prepayment speed and discount rate assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of servicing rights. See Note 7 and Note 18 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nCore deposit intangible assets. Other intangible assets primarily consist of core deposit intangible assets. In valuing core deposit intangibles, we consider variables such as deposit servicing costs, attrition rates and market discount rates. Core deposit intangibles are reviewed annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. If the recoverable amount of the core deposit intangibles is determined to be less than its carrying value, we would then measure the amount of impairment based on an estimate of the fair value at that time. We also evaluate whether the events or circumstances have occurred that warrant a revision to the remaining useful lives of intangible assets. In cases where a revision is deemed appropriate, the remaining carrying amounts of the intangible assets are amortized over the revised remaining useful life. Core deposit intangibles are currently amortized over an approximate ten year period.\nCustomer relationship intangible. Other intangible assets also include our customer relationship intangible asset. In valuing our customer relationship intangibles, we consider variables such as assets under management, attrition rates, and fee structure. Customer relationship intangibles are currently amortized over a 12 year period.\nFair value of financial instruments\nASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement.\nSee Note 18 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for a complete discussion of our use of fair value of financial assets and liabilities and their related measurement practices.\nValuation of real estate held for sale\nOther real estate owned (OREO). OREO includes real estate assets that have been acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure or repossession and are to be sold. OREO assets are initially recorded at fair value, less estimated costs to sell, of the collateral of the loan, on the date of foreclosure or repossession, establishing a new cost basis. Adjustments that reduce loan balances to fair value at the time of foreclosure or repossession are recognized as charge-offs in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Positive adjustments, if any, at the time of foreclosure or repossession are recognized in non-interest expense. After foreclosure or repossession, management periodically obtains new valuations and real estate or other assets may be adjusted to a lower carrying amount, determined by the fair value of the asset, less estimated costs to sell. Any subsequent write-downs are recorded as a decrease in the asset and charged against other real estate owned valuation adjustments, included within non-interest expense. Operating expenses of such properties, net of related income, are included in non-interest expense, and gains and losses on their disposition are included in non-interest expense. Gains on internally financed other real estate owned sales are accounted for in accordance with the methods stated in ASC Topic 360-20, Real Estate Sales ( ASC 360-20\u201d). Any losses on the sales of other real estate owned properties are recognized immediately.\nAssets held for sale. Assets held for sale consist of former branch locations and real estate purchased for expansion. Assets are considered held for sale when management has approved a plan to sell the assets following a branch closure or other events. The properties are being actively marketed and transferred to assets held for sale based at the lower of its carrying value or its fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Adjustments to reduce the asset balances to fair value are recorded at the time of transfer and are recognized through a charge against income. An assessment of the recoverability of other long-lived assets associated with all branches is periodically performed, resulting in impairment losses which are reflected in other non-interest expense.\nIncome taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. The objective of the asset and liability method is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the income tax basis of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and available tax planning opportunities. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties.\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss carryforwards. We review our deferred tax positions quarterly for changes which may impact realizability. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. We use short and long-range business forecasts to provide additional information for its evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets. It is our policy to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions, if applicable, as components of non-interest expense.\nA deferred tax valuation allowance is established to reduce the net carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is determined to be more likely than not that all or some of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. See Note 11 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for further information on income taxes.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, including the effective dates of adoption and anticipated effects on our results of operations and finance as condition, see Note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report.\nPrimary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Business\nAs a financial institution, we manage and evaluate various aspects of both our results of operations and our financial condition. We evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our consolidated financial statements as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry. We analyze these ratios and financial trends against our own historical performance, our budgeted performance and the final condition and performance of comparable financial institutions in our region. Comparison of our financial performance against other financial institutions is impacted by the accounting for acquired non-impaired and acquired impaired loans.\nThese factors and metrics described in this annual report on Form 10-K may not provide an appropriate basis to compare our results or financial condition to the results or financial condition of other financial services companies, given our limited operating history and strategic acquisitions since our recapitalization.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nOur results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of interest income on loans and lease receivables, including accretion income on loans, investment securities and other short-term investments and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits and borrowings. Our results of operations are also dependent upon our generation of non-interest income, consisting primarily of income from fees and service charges on deposits, loan servicing revenue, wealth management and trust income, ATM and interchange fees, and net gains on sales of investment securities and loans. Other factors contributing to our results of operations include our provisions for loan and lease losses, provision for income taxes, and non-interest expenses, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses and other miscellaneous operating costs.\nWe reported consolidated net income of $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to net income of $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $15.8 million. The increase in net income was attributable to a $37.7 million increase in net interest income and a $5.0 million increase in non-interest income, offset by a $6.0 million increase in provision for income taxes, a $18.9 million increase in non-interest expense, and a $1.9 million increase in provision for loan and lease losses. The increase in net interest income during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily a result of our recent acquisitions, organic loan and lease growth, and security purchases, offset by increases in the costs of interest-bearing deposits and increases in average FHLB advances during the current period. The increase in non-interest income was primarily driven by a decreased downward loan servicing asset revaluation, security sales during the period, an increase in the fair value of equity securities, net, and the acquisitions. The increase in provision for income taxes was mostly driven by an increase in net income before provision for income taxes during the period. The increase in non-interest expense was mainly due to additional costs associated with the acquisitions, primarily salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by a decrease in data processing of $4.5 million resulting from the core system conversion charges incurred in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in provision for loan and lease losses was mainly driven by increases in the general reserves driven by loan and lease originations.\nWe reported consolidated net income of $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to net income of $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $19.5 million. The increase in net income was attributable to a $55.7 million increase in net interest income, a $4.9 million decrease in provision for income taxes, and a $1.5 million increase in non-interest income, offset by a $36.4 million increase in non-interest expense and a $6.1 million increase in provision for loan and lease losses. The increase in net interest income during the year ended December 31, 2018 was a result of the First Evanston acquisition, organic loan growth, and recent market interest rate increases, slightly offset by increases in interest-bearing deposit costs during the current period. The decrease in provision for income taxes was primarily driven by the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets resulting from federal tax reform during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in non-interest income was primarily driven by increased fees and service charges as well as wealth management and trust income as a result of the First Evanston acquisition. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $13.1 million due to organizational growth as a result of the First Evanston acquisition, an increase in data processing of $8.7 million due to expenses incurred in 2018 related to the core banking system conversion we completed in the first quarter of 2019, and an increase in legal, audit and other professional fees of $4.3 million partially due to merger-related expenses. The increase in provision for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by new loan and lease originations.\nDividends declared and paid on preferred shares were $783,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. During the second quarter of 2017, and in connection with our initial public offering, we agreed to repurchase all $15.0 million of our outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock for $25.5 million. The $10.5 million excess of consideration paid over the $15.0 million carrying amount of the Series A Preferred Stock was treated as a one-time dividend declaration on the Series A Preferred Stock. Both the dividend declared on the Series A Preferred Stock and the regular quarterly dividends paid on our Series B Preferred Stock are reflected in the reported net income available to common stockholders. For the year ended December 31, 2017, dividends on the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock were $11.3 million, or $0.42 per basic and $0.41 per diluted common share.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, net income available to common stockholders was $56.2 million, or $1.51 per basic and $1.48 per diluted common share, $40.4 million, or $1.21 per basic and $1.18 per diluted common share, and $10.4 million, or $0.39 per basic and $0.38 per diluted common share, respectively.\nOur results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 produced an annual return on average assets of 1.08%, 0.97% and 0.66%, and a return on average stockholders' equity of 8.05%, 7.34% and 5.08%, respectively.\nNet interest income\nNet interest income, representing interest income less interest expense, is a significant contributor to our revenues and earnings. We generate interest income from interest and dividends on interest-earning assets, which include loans, leases and investment securities we own. We incur interest expense from interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which include interest-bearing deposits, FHLB advances, junior subordinated debentures and other borrowings. To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor (i) yields on our loans and other interest-earning assets, (ii) the costs of our deposits and other funding sources, (iii) our net interest spread and (iv) our net interest margin. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as the net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because non-interest-bearing sources of funds, such as non-interest-bearing deposits and stockholders' equity, also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these non-interest-bearing sources.\nWe also recognize income from the accretable discounts associated with the purchase of interest-earning assets. Because of our recapitalization and acquisitions, we derive a portion of our interest income from the accretable discounts on acquired loans. The accretion is generally recognized over the life of the loan and is impacted by changes in expected cash flows on the loan. This accretion will continue to have an impact on our net interest income as long as loans acquired with a discount at acquisition represent a meaningful portion of our interest-earning assets. As of December 31, 2019, acquired loans with evidence of credit deterioration accounted for under ASC Topic 310-30, Accounting for Purchased Loans with Deteriorated Credit Quality, represented 6.8% of our total loan portfolio, compared to 8.0 % at December 31, 2018 and 14.4% at December 31, 2017.\nChanges in the market interest rates we earn on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing liabilities, are usually the largest drivers of periodic changes in net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income. In addition, our interest income includes the accretion of the discounts on our acquired loans, which will also affect our net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income.\nThe following tables present, for the periods indicated, information about (i) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rates; (iii) net interest income; (iv) the interest rate spread; and (v) the net interest margin. Yields have been calculated on a pre-tax basis (dollars in thousands):\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this report. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d. Byline assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and to general practices within the Banking industry. To prepare financial statements and interim financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates, assumptions and judgments based on available information. These estimates, assumptions and judgments affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes; and are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. As this information changes, actual results could differ from the estimates, assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements. In particular, management has identified several accounting policies that, due to the estimates, assumptions and judgements inherent in those policies, are critical in understanding our financial statements.\nThese critical accounting policies and estimates include (i) acquisition-related fair value computations, (ii) the carrying value of loans and leases, (iii) determining the provision and allowance for loan and lease losses, (iv) the valuation of intangible assets such as goodwill, servicing assets and core deposit intangibles, (v) the determination of fair value for financial instruments, including other-than-temporary-impairment losses, (vi) the valuation of real estate held for sale and (vii) the valuation of or recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe JOBS Act permits us an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards affecting public companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period, which means that the financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as any financial statements that we file in the future, will not be subject to all new or revised accounting standards generally applicable to public companies for the transition period for so long as we remain an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided for under the JOBS Act.\nThe following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and significant estimates that require us to make complex and subjective judgments. Additional information about these policies can be found in Note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report.\nBusiness combinations\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations ( ASC 805\u201d). We recognize the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition, with any excess of the fair value of consideration provided over the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Application of the acquisition method requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgements to determine the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.\nIn accordance with ASC 805, the acquiring company retains the right to make appropriate adjustments to the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity for information obtained during the measurement period about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The measurement period ends as of the earlier of (i) one year from the acquisition date or (ii) the date when the acquirer receives the information necessary to complete the business combination accounting.\nCarrying value of loans and leases\nOur accounting methods for loans and leases differ depending on whether they are new or acquired loans and leases; and for acquired loans, whether the loans were acquired at a discount as a result of credit deterioration since the date of origination.\nOriginated loans and leases\nWe account for originated loans and leases and purchased loans and leases not acquired through business combinations as originated loans and leases. The new loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any allowance for loan and lease losses, unamortized deferred fees and costs and unamortized premiums or discounts. The net amount of nonrefundable loan origination fees and certain direct costs associated with the lending process are deferred and amortized to interest income over the contractual lives of the new loans using methods which approximate the level yield method. Discounts and premiums are amortized or accreted to interest income over the estimated term of the new loans using methods that approximate the effective yield method. Interest income on new loans is accrued based on the unpaid principal balance outstanding. Additionally, once an acquired non-impaired loan reaches its contractual maturity date, it is re-underwritten, and if renewed, it is classified as an originated loan.\nAcquired loans and leases\nAcquired loans and leases are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value; therefore, an allowance for loan and lease losses is not recorded at the acquisition date. Acquired loans are evaluated upon acquisition and classified as either acquired impaired or acquired non-impaired. Acquired impaired loans reflect evidence of credit deterioration since origination for which it is probable that all contractually required principal and interest will not be collected by us. Subsequent to acquisition, we periodically update for changes in cash flow expectations, which are reflected in interest income over the life of the loan as accretable yield. Any subsequent decreases in expected cash flow attributable to credit deterioration are recognized by recording a provision for loan losses.\nFor acquired non-impaired loans and leases, the excess or deficit of the loan and lease principal balance over the fair value is recorded as a discount or premium at acquisition and is accreted through interest income over the life of the loan or lease. Subsequent to acquisition, these loans and leases are evaluated for credit deterioration and a provision for loan and lease losses would be recorded when probable loss is incurred. These loans and leases are evaluated for impairment consistent with originated loans and leases.\nProvision and allowance for loan and lease losses\nThe provision for loan and lease losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses ( ALLL\u201d) at an appropriate level based upon management's evaluation of the adequacy of general and specific loss reserves.\nThe ALLL is maintained at a level that management believes is appropriate to provide for known and inherent incurred loan and lease losses as of the dates of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, and we have established methodologies for the determination of its adequacy. The methodologies are set forth in a formal policy and take into consideration the need for an overall general valuation allowance as well as specific allowances that are determined on an individual loan basis. We increase our ALLL by charging provisions for probable losses against our income and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries.\nThe evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans and leases, changes in economic or other conditions may necessitate revision of the estimate in future periods.\nThe ALLL is maintained at a level management believes is sufficient to provide for probable losses based upon an ongoing review of the originated and acquired non-impaired loan and lease portfolios by portfolio category, which include consideration of actual loss experience, peer loss experience, changes in the size and risk profile of the portfolio, identification of individual problem loan and lease situations which may affect a borrower's ability to repay, and evaluation of prevailing economic conditions.\nFor acquired impaired loans, a specific valuation allowance is established when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all of the cash flows expected at acquisition, plus the additional cash flows expected to be collected arising from changes in estimates after acquisition.\nThe originated and non-impaired acquired loans have experienced increasing delinquency and credit loss history that have trended upward, primarily in the U.S. government guaranteed portfolio. The credit quality of loans in these loan portfolios are impacted by delinquency status and debt service coverage generated by the borrowers' businesses and fluctuations in the value of real estate collateral.\nAcquired non-impaired loans and originated loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due, according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements. All acquired non-impaired loans and originated loans of $100,000 or greater with an internal risk rating of substandard or below, or on nonaccrual, as well as loans classified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDR\u201d), are reviewed individually for impairment on a quarterly basis.\nGoodwill and intangible assets\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with our recapitalization and acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized but is periodically evaluated for impairment under the provisions of ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350\u201d).\nImpairment testing is performed using either a qualitative or quantitative approach at the reporting unit level. Our goodwill is allocated to Byline Bank, which is our only applicable reporting unit for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. We have selected November 30 as the date to perform the annual goodwill impairment test. Additionally, we perform a goodwill impairment evaluation on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate impairment potentially exists.\nServicing assets. Servicing assets are recognized separately when they are acquired through sales of loans or when the rights to service loans are purchased. When loans are sold with servicing rights retained, servicing assets are recorded at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing ( ASC 860\u201d). Fair value is based on market prices for comparable servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The fair value of servicing rights is highly sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions. Changes in the prepayment speed and discount rate assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of servicing rights. See Note 7 and Note 18 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nCore deposit intangible assets. Other intangible assets primarily consist of core deposit intangible assets. In valuing core deposit intangibles, we consider variables such as deposit servicing costs, attrition rates and market discount rates. Core deposit intangibles are reviewed annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. If the recoverable amount of the core deposit intangibles is determined to be less than its carrying value, we would then measure the amount of impairment based on an estimate of the fair value at that time. We also evaluate whether the events or circumstances have occurred that warrant a revision to the remaining useful lives of intangible assets. In cases where a revision is deemed appropriate, the remaining carrying amounts of the intangible assets are amortized over the revised remaining useful life. Core deposit intangibles are currently amortized over an approximate ten year period.\nCustomer relationship intangible. Other intangible assets also include our customer relationship intangible asset. In valuing our customer relationship intangibles, we consider variables such as assets under management, attrition rates, and fee structure. Customer relationship intangibles are currently amortized over a 12 year period.\nFair value of financial instruments\nASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement.\nSee Note 18 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for a complete discussion of our use of fair value of financial assets and liabilities and their related measurement practices.\nValuation of real estate held for sale\nOther real estate owned (OREO). OREO includes real estate assets that have been acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure or repossession and are to be sold. OREO assets are initially recorded at fair value, less estimated costs to sell, of the collateral of the loan, on the date of foreclosure or repossession, establishing a new cost basis. Adjustments that reduce loan balances to fair value at the time of foreclosure or repossession are recognized as charge-offs in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Positive adjustments, if any, at the time of foreclosure or repossession are recognized in non-interest expense. After foreclosure or repossession, management periodically obtains new valuations and real estate or other assets may be adjusted to a lower carrying amount, determined by the fair value of the asset, less estimated costs to sell. Any subsequent write-downs are recorded as a decrease in the asset and charged against other real estate owned valuation adjustments, included within non-interest expense. Operating expenses of such properties, net of related income, are included in non-interest expense, and gains and losses on their disposition are included in non-interest expense. Gains on internally financed other real estate owned sales are accounted for in accordance with the methods stated in ASC Topic 360-20, Real Estate Sales ( ASC 360-20\u201d). Any losses on the sales of other real estate owned properties are recognized immediately.\nAssets held for sale. Assets held for sale consist of former branch locations and real estate purchased for expansion. Assets are considered held for sale when management has approved a plan to sell the assets following a branch closure or other events. The properties are being actively marketed and transferred to assets held for sale based at the lower of its carrying value or its fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Adjustments to reduce the asset balances to fair value are recorded at the time of transfer and are recognized through a charge against income. An assessment of the recoverability of other long-lived assets associated with all branches is periodically performed, resulting in impairment losses which are reflected in other non-interest expense.\nIncome taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. The objective of the asset and liability method is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the income tax basis of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and available tax planning opportunities. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties.\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss carryforwards. We review our deferred tax positions quarterly for changes which may impact realizability. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. We use short and long-range business forecasts to provide additional information for its evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets. It is our policy to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions, if applicable, as components of non-interest expense.\nA deferred tax valuation allowance is established to reduce the net carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is determined to be more likely than not that all or some of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. See Note 11 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for further information on income taxes.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, including the effective dates of adoption and anticipated effects on our results of operations and finance as condition, see Note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report.\nPrimary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Business\nAs a financial institution, we manage and evaluate various aspects of both our results of operations and our financial condition. We evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our consolidated financial statements as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry. We analyze these ratios and financial trends against our own historical performance, our budgeted performance and the final condition and performance of comparable financial institutions in our region. Comparison of our financial performance against other financial institutions is impacted by the accounting for acquired non-impaired and acquired impaired loans.\nThese factors and metrics described in this annual report on Form 10-K may not provide an appropriate basis to compare our results or financial condition to the results or financial condition of other financial services companies, given our limited operating history and strategic acquisitions since our recapitalization.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nOur results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of interest income on loans and lease receivables, including accretion income on loans, investment securities and other short-term investments and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits and borrowings. Our results of operations are also dependent upon our generation of non-interest income, consisting primarily of income from fees and service charges on deposits, loan servicing revenue, wealth management and trust income, ATM and interchange fees, and net gains on sales of investment securities and loans. Other factors contributing to our results of operations include our provisions for loan and lease losses, provision for income taxes, and non-interest expenses, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses and other miscellaneous operating costs.\nWe reported consolidated net income of $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to net income of $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $15.8 million. The increase in net income was attributable to a $37.7 million increase in net interest income and a $5.0 million increase in non-interest income, offset by a $6.0 million increase in provision for income taxes, a $18.9 million increase in non-interest expense, and a $1.9 million increase in provision for loan and lease losses. The increase in net interest income during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily a result of our recent acquisitions, organic loan and lease growth, and security purchases, offset by increases in the costs of interest-bearing deposits and increases in average FHLB advances during the current period. The increase in non-interest income was primarily driven by a decreased downward loan servicing asset revaluation, security sales during the period, an increase in the fair value of equity securities, net, and the acquisitions. The increase in provision for income taxes was mostly driven by an increase in net income before provision for income taxes during the period. The increase in non-interest expense was mainly due to additional costs associated with the acquisitions, primarily salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by a decrease in data processing of $4.5 million resulting from the core system conversion charges incurred in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in provision for loan and lease losses was mainly driven by increases in the general reserves driven by loan and lease originations.\nWe reported consolidated net income of $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to net income of $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $19.5 million. The increase in net income was attributable to a $55.7 million increase in net interest income, a $4.9 million decrease in provision for income taxes, and a $1.5 million increase in non-interest income, offset by a $36.4 million increase in non-interest expense and a $6.1 million increase in provision for loan and lease losses. The increase in net interest income during the year ended December 31, 2018 was a result of the First Evanston acquisition, organic loan growth, and recent market interest rate increases, slightly offset by increases in interest-bearing deposit costs during the current period. The decrease in provision for income taxes was primarily driven by the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets resulting from federal tax reform during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in non-interest income was primarily driven by increased fees and service charges as well as wealth management and trust income as a result of the First Evanston acquisition. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $13.1 million due to organizational growth as a result of the First Evanston acquisition, an increase in data processing of $8.7 million due to expenses incurred in 2018 related to the core banking system conversion we completed in the first quarter of 2019, and an increase in legal, audit and other professional fees of $4.3 million partially due to merger-related expenses. The increase in provision for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by new loan and lease originations.\nDividends declared and paid on preferred shares were $783,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. During the second quarter of 2017, and in connection with our initial public offering, we agreed to repurchase all $15.0 million of our outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock for $25.5 million. The $10.5 million excess of consideration paid over the $15.0 million carrying amount of the Series A Preferred Stock was treated as a one-time dividend declaration on the Series A Preferred Stock. Both the dividend declared on the Series A Preferred Stock and the regular quarterly dividends paid on our Series B Preferred Stock are reflected in the reported net income available to common stockholders. For the year ended December 31, 2017, dividends on the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock were $11.3 million, or $0.42 per basic and $0.41 per diluted common share.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, net income available to common stockholders was $56.2 million, or $1.51 per basic and $1.48 per diluted common share, $40.4 million, or $1.21 per basic and $1.18 per diluted common share, and $10.4 million, or $0.39 per basic and $0.38 per diluted common share, respectively.\nOur results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 produced an annual return on average assets of 1.08%, 0.97% and 0.66%, and a return on average stockholders' equity of 8.05%, 7.34% and 5.08%, respectively.\nNet interest income\nNet interest income, representing interest income less interest expense, is a significant contributor to our revenues and earnings. We generate interest income from interest and dividends on interest-earning assets, which include loans, leases and investment securities we own. We incur interest expense from interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which include interest-bearing deposits, FHLB advances, junior subordinated debentures and other borrowings. To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor (i) yields on our loans and other interest-earning assets, (ii) the costs of our deposits and other funding sources, (iii) our net interest spread and (iv) our net interest margin. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as the net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because non-interest-bearing sources of funds, such as non-interest-bearing deposits and stockholders' equity, also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these non-interest-bearing sources.\nWe also recognize income from the accretable discounts associated with the purchase of interest-earning assets. Because of our recapitalization and acquisitions, we derive a portion of our interest income from the accretable discounts on acquired loans. The accretion is generally recognized over the life of the loan and is impacted by changes in expected cash flows on the loan. This accretion will continue to have an impact on our net interest income as long as loans acquired with a discount at acquisition represent a meaningful portion of our interest-earning assets. As of December 31, 2019, acquired loans with evidence of credit deterioration accounted for under ASC Topic 310-30, Accounting for Purchased Loans with Deteriorated Credit Quality, represented 6.8% of our total loan portfolio, compared to 8.0 % at December 31, 2018 and 14.4% at December 31, 2017.\nChanges in the market interest rates we earn on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing liabilities, are usually the largest drivers of periodic changes in net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income. In addition, our interest income includes the accretion of the discounts on our acquired loans, which will also affect our net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income.\nThe following tables present, for the periods indicated, information about (i) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rates; (iii) net interest income; (iv) the interest rate spread; and (v) the net interest margin. Yields have been calculated on a pre-tax basis (dollars in thousands):\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td>
