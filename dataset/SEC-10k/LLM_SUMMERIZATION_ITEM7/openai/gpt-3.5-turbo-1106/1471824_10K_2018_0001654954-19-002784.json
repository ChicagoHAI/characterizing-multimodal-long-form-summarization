Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto of the Teucrium Commodity Trust and all of the Funds which are series of the Trust included elsewhere in the annual report on Form 10-K.\nThis annual report on Form 10-K, including this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d contains forward-looking statements by terminology such as may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d expect,\u201d plan,\u201d anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d predict,\u201d potential\u201d or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. All statements (other than statements of historical fact) included in this filing that address activities, events or developments that will or may occur in the future, including such matters as movements in the commodities markets and indexes that track such movements, operations of the Funds, the Sponsor's plans and references to the future success of a Fund or the Funds and other similar matters, are forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially.\nThese statements are based upon certain assumptions and analyses the Sponsor has made based on its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors appropriate in the circumstances. Whether or not actual results and developments will conform to the Sponsor's expectations and predictions, however, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the special considerations discussed in this prospectus, general economic, market and business conditions, changes in laws or regulations, including those concerning taxes, made by governmental authorities or regulatory bodies, and other world economic and political developments. Consequently, all the forward-looking statements made in this filing are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that actual results or developments the Sponsor anticipates will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the expected consequences to, or have the expected effects on, the operations of the Funds or the value of the Shares of the Funds.\nTrust Overview\nThe business and operations of the Trust and each Fund are described above under Part I, Item I entitled Business.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Trust's critical accounting policies for all the Funds are as follows:\n1.\nPreparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally-accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates, and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period of the combined financial statements and accompanying notes. The Trust's application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used.\n2.\nThe Sponsor has determined that the valuation of Commodity Interests that are not traded on a U.S. or internationally recognized futures exchange (such as swaps and other over-the-counter contracts) involves a critical accounting policy. The values which are used by the Funds for futures contracts will be provided by the commodity broker who will use market prices when available, while over-the-counter contracts will be valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date. Values will be determined on a daily basis.\n3.\nCommodity futures contracts held by the Funds are recorded on the trade date. All such transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis and marked to market daily. Unrealized appreciation or depreciation on commodity futures contracts are reflected in the statement of operations as the difference between the original contract amount and the fair market value as of the last business day of the year or as of the last date of the financial statements. Changes in the appreciation or depreciation between periods are reflected in the statement of operations. Interest on cash equivalents and deposits are recognized on the accrual basis. The Funds earn interest on funds held at the custodian or other financial institutions at prevailing market rates for such investments.\n4.\nCash and cash equivalents are cash held at financial institutions in demand-deposit accounts or highly-liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less at inception. The Funds reported cash equivalents in the statements of assets and liabilities at market value, or at carrying amounts that approximate fair value, because of their highly-liquid nature and short-term maturities. The Funds have a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with banks. Assets deposited with financial institutions may, at times, exceed federally insured limits.\n5.\nThe use of fair value to measure financial instruments, with related unrealized gains or losses recognized in earnings in each period is fundamental to the Trust's financial statements. In accordance with GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price\u201d) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nIn determining fair value, the Trust uses various valuation approaches. In accordance with GAAP, a fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Trust. Unobservable inputs reflect the Trust's assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels: a) Level 1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Trust has the ability to access. Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to Level 1 securities and financial instruments. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these securities and financial instruments does not entail a significant degree of judgment, b) Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, and c) Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. See the notes within the financial statements for further information.\nThe Funds and the Trust record their derivative activities at fair value. Gains and losses from derivative contracts are included in the statement of operations. Derivative contracts include futures contracts related to commodity prices. Futures, which are listed on a national securities exchange, such as the CBOT or the Intercontinental Exchange ( ICE\u201d), or reported on another national market, are generally categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. OTC derivatives contracts (such as forward and swap contracts) which may be valued using models, depending on whether significant inputs are observable or unobservable, are categorized in Levels 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n6.\nBrokerage commissions on all open commodity futures contracts are accrued on a full-turn basis.\n7.\nMargin is the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited by a commodity interest trader with the trader's broker to initiate and maintain an open position in futures contracts. A margin deposit acts to assure the trader's performance of the futures contracts purchased or sold. Futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on initial margin that represents a very small percentage of the aggregate purchase or sales price of the contract. Because of such low margin requirements, price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that, in relation to the amount invested, are greater than are customary in other forms of investment or speculation. As discussed below, adverse price changes in the futures contract may result in margin requirements that greatly exceed the initial margin. In addition, the amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract. Brokerage firms, such as the Funds' clearing brokers, carrying accounts for traders in commodity interest contracts generally require higher amounts of margin as a matter of policy to further protect themselves. Over-the-counter trading generally involves the extension of credit between counterparties, so the counterparties may agree to require the posting of collateral by one or both parties to address credit exposure.\nWhen a trader purchases an option, there is no margin requirement; however, the option premium must be paid in full. When a trader sells an option, on the other hand, he or she is required to deposit margin in an amount determined by the margin requirements established for the underlying interest and, in addition, an amount substantially equal to the current premium for the option. The margin requirements imposed on the selling of options, although adjusted to reflect the probability that out-of-the-money options will not be exercised, can in fact be higher than those imposed in dealing in the futures markets directly. Complicated margin requirements apply to spreads and conversions, which are complex trading strategies in which a trader acquires a mixture of options positions and positions in the underlying interest.\nOngoing or maintenance\u201d margin requirements are computed each day by a trader's clearing broker. When the market value of a particular open futures contract changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements, a margin call is made by the broker. If the margin call is not met within a reasonable time, the broker may close out the trader's position. With respect to the Funds' trading, the Funds (and not its shareholders personally) are subject to margin calls.\nFinally, many major U.S. exchanges have passed certain cross margining arrangements involving procedures pursuant to which the futures and options positions held in an account would, in the case of some accounts, be aggregated, and margin requirements would be assessed on a portfolio basis, measuring the total risk of the combined positions.\n8.\nDue from/to broker for investments in financial instruments are securities transactions pending settlement. The Trust and TAGS are subject to credit risk to the extent any broker with whom it conducts business is unable to fulfill contractual obligations on its behalf. The management of the Trust and the Funds monitors the financial condition of such brokers and does not anticipate any losses from these counterparties. Since the inception of the Fund, the principal broker through which the Trust and TAGS clear securities transactions for TAGS is the Bank of New York Mellon Capital Markets.\n9.\nThe investment objective of TAGS is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the Net Asset Value ( NAV\u201d) of its common units ( Shares\u201d) reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average (the Underlying Fund Average\u201d) of the NAVs per share of four other commodity pools that are series of the Trust and are sponsored by the Sponsor: the Teucrium Corn Fund, the Teucrium Wheat Fund, the Teucrium Soybean Fund and the Teucrium Sugar Fund (collectively, the Underlying Funds\u201d). The Underlying Fund Average will have a weighting of 25% to each Underlying Fund, and the Fund's assets will be rebalanced, generally on a daily basis, to maintain the approximate 25% allocation to each Underlying Fund. As such, TAGS will buy, sell and hold as part of its normal operations shares of the four Underlying Funds. The Trust excludes the shares of the other series of the Trust owned by the Teucrium Agricultural Fund from its statements of assets and liabilities. The Trust excludes the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on securities owned by the Teucrium Agricultural Fund from its statements of operations. Upon the sale of the Underlying Funds by the Teucrium Agricultural Fund, the Trust includes any realized gain or loss in its statements of changes in net assets.\n10.\nFor tax purposes, the Funds will be treated as partnerships. Therefore, the Funds do not record a provision for income taxes because the partners report their share of a Fund's income or loss on their income tax returns. The financial statements reflect the Funds' transactions without adjustment, if any, required for income tax purposes.\n11.\nThe Sponsor is responsible for investing the assets of the Funds in accordance with the objectives and policies of each Fund. The Funds pay for all brokerage fees, taxes and other expenses, including licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, registration or other fees paid to the SEC, FINRA, formerly the National Association of Securities Dealers, or any other regulatory agency in connection with the offer and sale of subsequent Shares after its initial registration and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated therewith. The Fund also pays its portion of the fees and expenses for services directly attributable to the Fund such as accounting, financial reporting, regulatory compliance and trading activities, which the Sponsor elected not to outsource. Certain aggregate expenses common to all Teucrium Funds within the Trust are allocated by the Sponsor to the respective funds based on activity drivers deemed most appropriate by the Sponsor for such expenses, including but not limited to relative assets under management and creation order activity. These aggregate common expenses include, but are not limited to, legal, auditing, accounting and financial reporting, tax-preparation, regulatory compliance, trading activities, and insurance costs, as well as fees paid to the Distributor. A portion of these aggregate common expenses are related to the Sponsor or related parties of principals of the Sponsor; these are necessary services to the Teucrium Funds, which are primarily the cost of performing certain accounting and financial reporting, regulatory compliance, and trading activities that are directly attributable to the Fund and are included, primarily, in distribution and marketing fees. In addition, the Funds, except for TAGS which has no such fee, are contractually obligated to pay a monthly management fee to the Sponsor, based on average daily net assets, at a rate equal to 1.00% per annum.\n12.\nThe Funds pay for all brokerage fees, taxes and other expenses, including licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, registration or other fees paid to the SEC, FINRA, formerly the National Association of Securities Dealers, or any other regulatory agency in connection with the offer and sale of subsequent Shares, after its initial registration, and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated therewith. The Funds also pay the fees and expenses associated with the Trust's tax accounting and reporting requirements. Certain aggregate expenses common to all Funds within the Trust are allocated by the Sponsor to the respective Fund based on activity drivers deemed most appropriate by the Sponsor for such expenses, including but not limited to relative assets under management and creation and redeem order activity. These aggregate common expenses include, but are not limited to, legal, auditing, accounting and financial reporting, tax-preparation, regulatory compliance, trading activities, and insurance costs, as well as fees paid to the Distributor, which are included in the related line item in the combined statements of operations. A portion of these aggregate common expenses are related to the Sponsor or related parties of principals of the Sponsor; these are necessary services to the Trust and the Funds, which are primarily the cost of performing accounting and financial reporting, regulatory compliance, and trading activities that are directly attributable to the Trust and the Funds. Such expenses are primarily included as distribution and marketing fees.\n13.\nFor commercial paper, the Funds use the effective interest method for calculating the actual interest rate in a period based on the amount of a financial instrument's book value at the beginning of the accounting period. Accretion on these investments are recognized on the effective interest method in U.S. dollars and recognized in cash equivalents. All discounts on purchase prices of debt securities are accreted over the life of the respective security.\nResults of Operations\nThe discussion below addresses the material changes in the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. CORN, SOYB, CANE WEAT and TAGS operated for the entirety of all periods discussed below.\nTotal expenses for the current and comparative periods are presented both gross and net of any expenses waived or paid by the Sponsor that would have been incurred by the Funds ( expenses waived by the Sponsor\u201d). For all expenses waived in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the Sponsor has determined that no reimbursement will be sought in future periods. Total expenses, net\u201d, which is after the impact of any expenses waived by or reimbursed to the Sponsor, are presented in the same manner as previously reported. There is, therefore, no impact to or change in the net gain or net loss in any period for the Trust and each Fund as a result of this change in presentation.\nIn accordance with ASU 2016-18 issued by the FASB, the presentation of restricted cash on the financial statements for the period ending December 31, 2017 was updated to be included in Cash and Cash Equivalents\u201d on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities and the Statements of Cash Flows, and as specified in the Notes to the Financial Statements under Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\u201d. This presentation did not have a material impact on the financial statements and disclosures of the Trust and the Funds. Effective October 2017, for all funds the balance for restricted cash held in custody at the Bank of New York Mellon was $0.\nThe Sponsor is responsible for investing the assets of the Fund in accordance with the objectives and policies of the Fund. In addition, the Sponsor arranges for one or more third parties to provide administrative, custodial, accounting, transfer agency and other necessary services to the Fund, including services directly attributable to the Fund such as accounting, financial reporting, regulatory compliance and trading activities, which the Sponsor elected not to outsource. In addition, the Funds, except for TAGS which has no such fee, are contractually obligated to pay a monthly management fee to the Sponsor, based on average daily net assets, at a rate equal to 1.00% per annum.\nThe Fund generally pays for all brokerage fees, taxes and other expenses, including licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, registration or other fees paid to the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA\u201d), or any other regulatory agency in connection with the offer and sale of subsequent Shares after its initial registration and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated therewith. Each Fund also pays its portion of the fees and expenses associated with the Trust's tax accounting and reporting requirements. Certain aggregate expenses common to all Funds within the Trust are allocated by the Sponsor to the respective funds based on activity drivers deemed most appropriate by the Sponsor for such expenses, including but not limited to relative assets under management and creation order activity. These aggregate common expenses include, but are not limited to, legal, auditing, accounting and financial reporting, tax-preparation, regulatory compliance, trading activities, and insurance costs, as well as fees paid to the Distributor, which are included in the related line item in the statements of operations. A portion of these aggregate common expenses are related to services provided by the Sponsor or related parties of principals of the Sponsor; these are necessary services to the Funds, which are primarily the cost of performing accounting and financial reporting, regulatory compliance, and trading activities that are directly attributable to the Funds and are, primarily, included as distribution and marketing fees on the statements of operations. These amounts, for the Trust and for each Fund, are detailed in the notes to the financial statements included in Part II of this filing.\nThe Sponsor has the ability to elect to pay certain expenses on behalf of the Funds or waive the management fee. This election is subject to change by the Sponsor, at its discretion. Expenses paid by the Sponsor and Management fees waived by the Sponsor are, if applicable, presented as waived expenses in the statements of operations for each Fund.\nFor the period January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018, the Funds, in total, recorded an increase in expenses, gross and net of any expenses waived by the Sponsor, over what had been recorded in 2017. For the year ending December 31, 2018, total expenses gross of any waived expenses, were $7,411,981, while total expenses, net were $6,184,551. For the year 2017, these were, $6,580,718 and $5,551,819, respectively. For 2016, these were $6,146,659 and $5,308,644, respectively. The increase in expenses for the period 2018 compared to 2017, gross of any waived expenses, was $831,263 which was driven by increases in all expense categories, specifically: 1) a $146,381 or 10% increase in management fees paid to the Sponsor; 2) a $112,954 or 8% increase in professional fees related to auditing, legal and tax preparation fees; 3) a $475,185 or 18% increase in distribution and marketing fees; 4) a $4,066 or 1% increase in custodian fees and expenses; 5) a $22,100 or 24% increase in business permits and licenses; 6) a $7,584 or 3% increase in general and administrative expenses; 7) a $36,347 or 23% increase in brokerage commissions due to an increase in contracts purchased and rolled; and 8) a $26,646 or 28% increase in other expenses. The 13% increase in expenses year over year was generally due to higher average net assets. Total expenses, net of expenses waived by the Sponsor, increased by $632,732 for 2018 compared to 2017 due to the increase in gross expenses, which was partially offset by an increase of $198,531 in expenses waived by the Sponsor.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, no reimbursement to the Sponsor will be sought in any future period for expenses that have been identified as waived by the Sponsor.\nTeucrium Corn Fund\nThe Teucrium Corn Fund commenced investment operations on June 9, 2010. The investment objective of the Corn Fund is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the Shares' NAV reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average of the closing settlement prices for three futures contracts for corn ( Corn Futures Contracts\u201d) that are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade ( CBOT\u201d), specifically (1) the second-to-expire CBOT Corn Futures Contract, weighted 35%, (2) the third-to-expire CBOT Corn Futures Contract, weighted 30%, and (3) the CBOT Corn Futures Contract expiring in the December following the expiration month of the third-to-expire contract, weighted 35%. On December 31, 2018, the Corn Fund held a total of 2,889 CBOT Corn Futures contracts with a notional value of $56,379,850. Of these, 1,030 contracts had an asset fair value of $107,363, while 1,859 contracts had a liability fair value of $1,297,288. The weighting of the notional value of the contracts was weighted as follows: (1) 35% to the MAY19 contracts, the second-to-expire CBOT Corn Futures Contract, (2) 30% to JUL19 CBOT contracts, the third-to-expire CBOT Corn Futures Contract, and (3) 35% to DEC19 CBOT contracts, the CBOT Corn Futures Contract expiring in the December following the expiration month of the third-to-expire contract.\nThe benchmark for the Fund is the Teucrium Corn Index (TCORN) which is defined as: A weighted average of daily changes in the closing settlement prices of (1) the second-to-expire Corn Futures Contract traded on the CBOT, weighted 35%, (2) the third-to-expire CBOT Corn Futures Contract, weighted 30%, and (3) the CBOT Corn Futures Contract expiring in the December following the expiration month of third-to-expire contract, weighted 35%. To convert to an index, 100 is set to $25, the opening day price of CORN.\nThe chart below shows the percent change in the NAV per share for the Fund, the market price of the Fund shares, represented by the closing price of the Fund on the NYSE Arca or the mid-point of the 4 pm bid and ask if no closing price is available, and TCORN for two periods. One period is December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2018. The second period is from the commencement of operations to December 31, 2018. The Benchmark does not reflect any impact of expenses, which would generally reduce the Fund's NAV, or interest income, which would generally increase the NAV. The actual results for the NAV do include the impacts of both expenses and interest income.\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td> Period\n</td> <td> Change in NAV per share\n</td> <td> Change in Market Price\n</td> <td> Change in the Benchmark (TCORN)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2017 to December 31,\n</td> <td> -3.82%\n</td> <td> -4.28%\n</td> <td> -2.36%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> June 10, 2010 to December 31,\n</td> <td> -37.68%\n</td> <td> -37.77%\n</td> <td> -12.78%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nOn December 31, 2018, the Fund had 3,500,004 shares outstanding and net assets of $56,379,057. This is in comparison to 3,875,004 shares outstanding and net assets of $64,901,479 on December 31, 2017 and 3,900,004 shares outstanding with net assets of $73,213,541 on December 31, 2016. Shares outstanding decreased by 375,000 or 10% for the period of 2018 when compared to 2017. This slight decrease was, in the opinion of management, due to the uncertainty in the market due to the trade dispute with China. In total, the Fund issued 1,525,000 shares and purchased 1,900,000 shares, in 2018, as part of creation and redemption baskets. For the period 2018 compared to 2016, there was a decrease in shares outstanding of 400,000 or 10%. In total, in 2017, the Fund issued 1,325,000 shares and purchased 1,350,000 shares as part of creation and redemption baskets.\nTotal net assets for the Fund were $56,379,057 on December 31, 2018, compared to $64,901,479 on December 31, 2017 and $73,213,541 on December 31, 2016. The Net Asset Values ( NAV\u201d) per share related to these balances were $16.11, $16.75, and $18.77 respectively. When comparing December 31, 2018 with 2017, there was a decrease in total net assets of 13%, driven by a combination of a decrease in the number of shares outstanding of 375,000 or 10% and a decrease in the NAV per share of ($0.64) or 4%. When comparing December 31, 2018 with 2016, there was a decrease in total net assets of 23%, driven by a combination of an decrease in the number of shares outstanding of 400,000 or 10% and a change in the NAV per share which decreased by ($2.66) or 14%. The closing prices per share for 2018, 2017 and 2016, as reported by the NYSE Arca, were $16.05, $16.77, and $18.71, respectively. The change from December 31, 2018 over prior years was a 4% decrease from 2017 and a 14% decrease from 2016.\nThe graph below shows the actual shares outstanding, total net assets (or AUM) and net asset value per share (NAV per share) for the Fund from inception to December 31, 2018 and serves to illustrate the relative changes of these components.\nThe total loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 was ($892,853) resulting primarily from the net change in realized loss on commodity futures contracts totaling ($3,025,313), and by a net change in unrealized appreciation of commodity futures contracts of $651,638. Total loss was ($5,205,716) in 2017, and ($6,594,484) in 2016. Realized gain or loss on trading of commodity futures contracts is a function of: 1) the change in the price of the particular contracts sold as part of a roll\u201d in contracts as the nearest to expire contracts are exchanged for the appropriate contact given the investment objective of the fund, 2) the change in the price of particular contracts sold in relation to redemption of shares, 3) the gain or loss associated with rebalancing trades which are made to ensure conformance to the benchmark and 4) the number of contracts held and then sold for either circumstance aforementioned. Unrealized gain or loss on trading of commodity futures contracts is a function of the change in the price of contracts held on the final date of the period versus the purchase price for each contract and the number of contracts held in each contract month. The Sponsor has a static benchmark as described above and trades futures contracts to adhere to that benchmark and to adjust for the creation or redemption of shares.\nInterest income for year ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, was $1,480,822, $778,560, and $396,679. This increase year-over-year was the result of the Sponsor investing, at times, a portion of the available cash for the Fund in alternative demand deposit savings accounts with more attractive overnight deposit rates. Effective October 3, 2017, the Fund invested in investment grade commercial paper with maturities of ninety days or less. These investments provide a higher rate than money market products offered in the past. Interest rates paid on cash balances of the Fund have increased beginning March 2017 and have continued to increase through December 2018. These higher levels of interest rates are projected to remain at the current level in 2019 or slightly increase, absent any decreases in the Federal Funds rate.\nTotal expenses gross of expenses waived by the Sponsor ( Total expenses\u201d) for 2018 were $2,801,361; total expenses for 2017 were $2,918,936 and $3,411,916 in 2016. This represents a ($117,575) or 4% decrease for 2018 over 2017 and a ($610,555) or 18% decrease for 2018 over 2016. The decrease for 2018 over 2017 was driven by: 1) a ($93,280) or 15% decrease in professional fees related to auditing, legal and tax preparation fees; and 2) a ($12,937) or 1% decrease in distribution and marketing fees; 3) a ($26,510) or 17% decrease in custodian fees and expenses; 4) a ($2,590) or 10% decrease in business permits and licenses; and 5) a ($17,286) or 14% decrease in general and administrative expenses. These decreases were partially offset by: 1) a $21,330 or 3% increase in management fee paid to the Sponsor as a result of higher average net assets; 2) a $11,365 or 14% increase in brokerage commissions due to an increase in contracts purchased and rolled; and 3) a $2,333 or 6% increase in other expenses. The decreases in operating expenses were due to expense controls under taken by the Sponsor and lower average net asset balance relative to the other Funds.\nThe decrease for 2018 over 2016 was driven by: 1) a ($15,179) or 2% decrease in the management fee paid to the Sponsor as a result of lower average net assets; 2) a ($509,033) or 49% decrease in professional fees related to auditing, legal and tax preparation fees; 3) a ($55,975) or 31% decrease in custodian fees and expenses; 4) a ($34,684) or 24% decrease in general and administrative expenses; and 5) a ($5,660) or 6% decrease in brokerage commissions due to an increase in contracts purchased and rolled. The decreases were partially offset by: 1) a $3,202 or 0% increase in distribution and marketing fees; 2) a $5,774 or 34% increase in business permits and licenses; and 3) a $1,000 or 2% increase in other expenses. The decreases in operating expenses were due to expense controls under taken by the Sponsor and lower average net asset balance relative to the other Funds. The total expense ratio gross of expenses waived by the Sponsor for these years was 3.98% in 2018, 4.28% in 2017, and 4.74% in 2016. The management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1% of the Fund's daily average net assets.\nThe Sponsor has the ability to elect to pay certain expenses on behalf of the Fund or waive the management fee. This election is subject to change by the Sponsor, at its discretion. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Sponsor waived fees of $280,817; the Sponsor has determined that no reimbursement will be sought in future periods for those expenses which have been waived for the year. The Sponsor permanently waived $409,562 of expenses in 2017 and $442,333 in 2016.\nTotal expenses net of expenses waived by the Sponsor and reimbursement to the Sponsor for previously waived expenses ( Total expenses, net\u201d) for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $2,520,544, $2,509,374, and $2,969,583 respectively. The total expense ratio net of expenses waived by the Sponsor periods was 3.58% in 2018, 3.68% in 2017, 4.13% in 2016. Net investment loss, which includes the impact of expenses and interest income, was 1.48% in 2018, 2.54% in 2017 and 3.58% in 2016.\nOther than the management fee to the Sponsor and the brokerage commissions, most of the expenses incurred by the Fund are associated with the day-to-day operation of the Fund and the necessary functions related to regulatory compliance. These are generally based on contracts, which extend for some period of time and up to one year, or commitments regardless of the level of assets under management. The structure of the Fund and the nature of the expenses are such that as total net assets grow, there is a scalability of expenses that may allow the total expense ratio to be reduced. However, if total net assets for the Fund fall, the total expense ratio of the Fund will increase unless additional reductions are made by the Sponsor to the daily expense accrual. The Sponsor can elect to adjust the daily expense accruals at its discretion based on market conditions and other Fund considerations.\nNet cash provided by (used in) the Fund's operating activities during the year was $879,697 in 2018, ($5,335,851) in 2017, and ($9,759,190) in 2016. In 2018, proceeds from the sale of shares were $26,460,193 in 2018, representing 1,525,000 shares while payments for redemptions were $31,569,218 representing 1,900,000 shares. In 2017, proceeds from the sale of shares were $25,173,968 representing 1,325,000 shares while payments for redemptions were $25,770,940, representing 1,350,000 shares. In 2016, proceeds from the sale of shares were $57,591,933, representing 2,875,000 shares while payments for redemptions were $35,870,548, representing 1,850,000 shares.\nThe seasonality patterns for corn futures prices are impacted by a variety of factors. These include, but are not limited to, the harvest in the fall, the planting conditions in the spring, and the weather throughout the critical germination and growing periods. Prices for corn futures are affected by the availability and demand for substitute agricultural commodities, including soybeans and wheat, and the demand for corn as an additive for fuel, through the production of ethanol. The price of corn futures contracts is also influenced by global economic conditions, including the demand for exports to other countries. Such factors will impact the performance of the Fund and the results of operations on an ongoing basis. The Sponsor cannot predict the impact of such factors.\nTeucrium Soybean Fund\nThe Teucrium Soybean Fund commenced investment operations on September 19, 2011. The investment objective of the Fund is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the Shares' Net Asset Value ( NAV\u201d) reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average of the closing settlement prices for three futures contracts for soybeans ( Soybean Futures Contracts\u201d) that are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade ( CBOT\u201d). Except as described in the following paragraph, the three Soybean Futures Contracts will be: (1) second-to-expire CBOT Soybean Futures Contract, weighted 35%, (2) the third-to-expire CBOT Soybean Futures Contract, weighted 30%, and (3) the CBOT Soybean Futures Contract expiring in the November following the expiration month of the third-to-expire contract, weighted 35%, except the CBOT soybean futures contracts expiring in August and September will not be part of the Teucrium Soybean Fund's Benchmark because of the less liquid market for these Futures Contracts. On December 31, 2018, the Fund held a total of 612 CBOT soybean futures contracts with a notional value of $27,925,551. Of these, 218 contracts had an asset fair value of $228,400, while 394 contracts had a liability fair value of $39,250. The weighting of the notional value of the contracts was weighted as follows: (1) 35% to MAR19 CBOT contracts, (2) 30% to MAY19 CBOT contracts, and (3) 35% to NOV19 CBOT contracts.\nThe benchmark for the Fund is the Teucrium Soybean Index (TSOYB) which is defined as: A weighted average of daily changes in the closing settlement prices of (1) second-to-expire CBOT Soybean Futures Contract, weighted 35%, (2) the third-to-expire CBOT Soybean Futures Contract, weighted 30%, and (3) the CBOT Soybean Futures Contract expiring in the November following the expiration month of the third-to-expire contract, weighted 35%, except the CBOT soybean futures contracts expiring in August and September will not be part of the Teucrium Soybean Fund's Benchmark because of the less liquid market for these Futures Contracts. During the period when the Excluded Contracts are the second-to-expire and third-to-expire Soybean Futures Contract, the fourth-to-expire and fifth-to-expire Soybean Futures Contracts will take the place of the second-to-expire and third-to-expire Soybean Futures Contracts, respectively, as Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. Similarly, when the August Contract is the third-to-expire Soybean Futures Contract, the fifth-to-expire Soybean Futures Contract will take the place of the August Contract as a Benchmark Component Futures Contract, and when the September Contract is the second-to-expire Soybean Futures Contract, the third-to-expire and fourth-to-expire Soybean Futures Contracts will be Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. To convert to an index, 100 is set to $25, the opening day price of SOYB.\nThe chart below shows the percent change in the NAV per share for the Fund, the market price of the Fund shares, represented by the closing price of the Fund on the NYSE Arca or the mid-point of the 4 pm bid and ask if no closing price is available, and TSOYB for two periods. One period is December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2018. The second period is from the commencement of operations to December 31, 2018. The Benchmark does not reflect any impact of expenses, which would generally reduce the Fund's NAV, or interest income, which would generally increase the NAV. The actual results for the NAV do include the impacts of both expenses and interest income.\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td> Period\n</td> <td> Change in NAV\nper share\n</td> <td> Change in\nMarket Price\n</td> <td> Change in the Benchmark (TSOYB)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2017 to December 31,\n</td> <td> -9.26%\n</td> <td> -9.51%\n</td> <td> -7.71%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 19, 2011 to December 31,\n</td> <td> -34.32%\n</td> <td> -35.49%\n</td> <td> -9.75%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nOn December 31, 2018, the Fund had 1,725,004 shares outstanding and net assets of $27,942,017.

Shares outstanding increased by 1,150,000 or 200% for the period of 2018 when compared to 2017. This increase was, in the opinion of management, due to the continued growth in China's soybean imports during the period reported. In total, the Fund issued 1,575,000 shares and purchased 425,000 shares as part of creation and redemption baskets in 2018. For the period 2018 compared to 2016, there was an increase in shares outstanding of 1,050,000 or 156%. In total, the Fund issued 1,100,000 shares and purchased 1,200,000 shares as part of creation and redemption baskets, in 2017.\nTotal net assets for the Fund were $27,942,017 on December 31, 2018, compared to $10,264,025 on December 31, 2017 and $12,882,100 on December 31, 2016. The Net Asset Values ( NAV\u201d) per share related to these balances were $16.20, $17.85, and $19.08 respectively. When comparing December 31, 2018 with 2017, there was an increase in total net assets of 172%, which was driven by a combination of a increase in total shares outstanding of 200% and a decrease in the NAV per share of ($1.65) or 9%. When comparing December 31, 2018 with 2016, there was an increase in total net assets of 117%, which was driven by a combination of an increase in the number of shares outstanding of 156% and a decrease in the NAV per share of ($2.88) or 15%. The closing prices per share for 2018, 2017, and 2016, as reported by the NYSE Arca, were $16.18, $17.88, and $19.10, respectively. The change from December 31, 2018 over prior years was a 10% decrease from 2017 and a 15% decrease from 2016.\nThe graph below shows the actual shares outstanding, total net assets (or AUM) and net asset value per share (NAV per share) for the Fund from inception to December 31, 2018 and serves to illustrate the relative changes of these components.\nTotal loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 was ($988,055) resulting from the net change in realized loss on commodity futures contracts totaling ($2,085,438) and a change in unrealized appreciation on commodity futures contracts of $637,213. Total (loss) income was ($632,168) in 2017 and $1,572,207 in 2016. Realized gain or loss on trading of commodity futures contracts is a function of: 1) the change in the price of the particular contracts sold as part of a roll\u201d in contracts as the nearest to expire contracts are exchanged for the appropriate contact given the investment objective of the fund, 2) the change in the price of particular contracts sold in relation to redemption of shares, 3) the gain or loss associated with rebalancing trades which are made to ensure conformance to the benchmark and 4) the number of contracts held and then sold for either circumstance aforementioned. Unrealized gain or loss on trading of commodity futures contracts is a function of the change in the price of contracts held on the final date of the period versus the purchase price for each contract and the number of contracts held in each contract month. The Sponsor has a static benchmark as described above and trades futures contracts to adhere to that benchmark and to adjust for the creation or redemption of shares.\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, was $460,170, $152,945, and $65,157. This increase year-over-year was the result of the Sponsor investing, at times, a portion of the available cash for the Fund in alternative demand deposit savings accounts with more attractive overnight deposit rates. Effective October 3, 2017, the Fund invested in investment grade commercial paper with maturities of ninety days or less. These investments provide a higher rate than money market products offered in the past. Interest rates paid on cash balances of the Fund have increased beginning March 2017 and have continued to increase through December 2018. These higher levels of interest rates are projected to remain at the current level in 2019 or slightly increase, absent any decreases in the Federal Funds rate.\nTotal expenses gross of expenses waived by the Sponsor ( Total expenses\u201d) for 2018 were $1,171,393; total expenses for 2017 were $610,101 and $546,593 in 2016.

Net investment loss, which includes the impact of expenses and interest income, was 1.56% in 2018, 1.68% in 2017, and 1.77% in 2016.\nOther than the management fee to the Sponsor and the brokerage commissions, most of the expenses incurred by the Fund are associated with the day-to-day operation of the Fund and the necessary functions related to regulatory compliance. These are generally based on contracts, which extend for some period of time and up to one year, or commitments regardless of the level of assets under management. The structure of the Fund and the nature of the expenses are such that as total net assets grow, there is a scalability of expenses that may allow the total expense ratio to be reduced. However, if total net assets for the Fund fall, the total expense ratio of the Fund will increase unless additional reductions are made by the Sponsor to the daily expense accrual. The Sponsor can elect to adjust the daily expense accruals at its discretion based on market conditions and other Fund considerations.\nNet cash used in the Fund's operating activities during the 2018 was ($2,518,149). Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities by the Fund was ($2,301,151) in 2017 and $1,359,306 in 2016. In 2018, proceeds from the sale of shares were $18,588,300 representing 2,450,000 shares while payments for the redemption of shares were $11,737,485 representing 1,575,000 shares. In 2017, proceeds from the sale of shares were $10,190,950 representing 925,000 shares while payments for the redemption of shares were $7,051,123 representing 700,000 shares. In 2016, proceeds from the sale of shares was $2,805,578 representing 250,000 while payments for the redemption of shares were $4,149,533 representing 375,000 shares.\nTeucrium Wheat Fund\nThe Teucrium Wheat Fund commenced investment operations on September 19, 2011. The investment objective of the Fund is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the Shares' Net Asset Value reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average of the closing settlement prices for three futures contracts for wheat ( Wheat Futures Contracts\u201d) that are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade ( CBOT\u201d), specifically: (1) the second-to-expire CBOT Wheat Futures Contract, weighted 35%, (2) the third-to-expire CBOT Wheat Futures Contract, weighted 30%, and (3) the CBOT Wheat Futures Contract expiring in the December following the expiration month of the third-to-expire contract, weighted 35%. On December 31, 2018, the Fund held a total of 2,106 CBOT wheat futures contracts with a notional value of $55,151,250. The contracts had a liability fair value of $3,985,400. The weighting of the notional value of the contracts was weighted as follows: (1) 35% to MAY19 CBOT contracts, (2) 30% to JUL19 CBOT contracts, and (3) 35% to DEC19 CBOT contracts.\nThe benchmark for the Fund is the Teucrium Wheat Index (TWEAT) which is defined as: A weighted average of daily changes in the closing settlement prices of (1) the second-to-expire Wheat Futures Contract traded on the CBOT, weighted 35%, (2) the third-to-expire CBOT Wheat Futures Contract, weighted 30%, and (3) the CBOT Wheat Futures Contract expiring in the December following the expiration month of third-to-expire contract, weighted 35%. To convert to an index, 100 is set to $25, the opening day price of WEAT.\nThe chart below shows the percent change in the NAV per share for the Fund, the market price of the Fund shares, represented by the closing price of the Fund on the NYSE Arca or the mid-point of the 4 pm bid and ask if no closing price is available, and TWEAT for two periods. One period is December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2018. The second period is from the commencement of operations to December 31, 2018. The Benchmark does not reflect any impact of expenses, which would generally reduce the Fund's NAV, or interest income, which would generally increase the NAV. The actual results for the NAV do include the impacts of both expenses and interest income.\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td> Period\n</td> <td> Change in NAV per share\n</td> <td> Change in Market Price\n</td> <td> Change in the Benchmark (TWEAT)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2017 to December 31,\n</td> <td> -0.76%\n</td> <td> -1.17%\n</td> <td> 0.95%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 19, 2011 to December 31,\n</td> <td> -75.72%\n</td> <td> -76.16%\n</td> <td> -66.27%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nOn December 31, 2018, the Fund had 9,275,004 shares outstanding and net assets of $55,149,873. This is in comparison to 10,250,004 shares outstanding and net assets of $61,416,019 on December 31, 2017 and 9,050,004 shares outstanding with net assets of $62,344,759 on December 31, 2016. Shares outstanding decreased by 975,000 or 10% for the period of 2018 when compared to 2017. This decrease was, in the opinion of management, due to larger projected U.S. supply, reduced domestic use and higher ending stocks. In 2018, the Fund issued 2,000,000 shares and purchased 2,975,000 shares as part of creation and redemption baskets. In 2017, the Fund issued 5,375,000 shares and purchased 4,175,000 shares as part of creation and redemption baskets. For the period 2018 compared to 2016, there was an increase in shares outstanding of 225,000 shares or 2%. In 2016, the Fund issued 6,475,000 shares and purchased 325,000 shares as part of creation and redemption baskets.\nTotal net assets for the Fund were $55,149,873 on December 31, 2018, compared to $61,416,019 on December 31, 2017 and $62,344,759 on December 31, 2016. The Net Asset Values ( NAV\u201d) per share related to these balances were $5.95, $5.99, and $6.89 respectively. When comparing December 31, 2018 with 2017, the net assets decreased by 10%, which was driven by a decrease in the number of shares outstanding of 10%. When comparing December 31, 2018 with 2016, there was a decrease in total net assets of 12%, driven by a combination of an increase in total shares outstanding of 2%, which was offset by a decrease in the NAV per share of ($0.94) or 14%. The closing prices per share for 2018, 2017 and 2016, as reported by the NYSE Arca, were $5.93, $6.00, and $6.88, respectively. The change from December 31, 2018 over prior years was a 1% decrease from 2017 and a 14% decrease from 2016.\nThe graph below shows the actual shares outstanding, total net assets (or AUM) and net asset value per share (NAV per share) for the Fund from inception to December 31, 2018 and serves to illustrate the relative changes of these components.\nThe total income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $2,455,989 resulting primarily from the net change in realized gain on commodity futures contracts totaling $2,502,112, and by a net change in unrealized depreciation of commodity futures contracts of ($1,389,350). Total loss was ($3,234,218) in 2017, and ($11,396,927) in 2016. Realized gain or loss on trading of commodity futures contracts is a function of: 1) the change in the price of the particular contracts sold as part of a roll\u201d in contracts as the nearest to expire contracts are exchanged for the appropriate contact given the investment objective of the fund, 2) the change in the price of particular contracts sold in relation to redemption of shares, 3) the gain or loss associated with rebalancing trades which are made to ensure conformance to the benchmark and 4) the number of contracts held and then sold for either circumstance aforementioned. Unrealized gain or loss on trading of commodity futures contracts is a function of the change in the price of contracts held on the final date of the period versus the purchase price for each contract and the number of contracts held in each contract month. The Sponsor has a static benchmark as described above and trades futures contracts to adhere to that benchmark and to adjust for the creation or redemption of shares.\nInterest income for year ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, was $1,343,227, $745,357, and $231,598. This increase year-over-year was the result of the Sponsor investing, at times, a portion of the available cash for the Fund in alternative demand deposit savings accounts with more attractive overnight deposit rates. Effective October 3, 2017, the Fund invested in investment grade commercial paper with maturities of ninety days or less. These investments provide a higher rate than money market products offered in the past. Interest rates paid on cash balances of the Fund have increased beginning March 2017 and have continued to increase through December 2018. These higher levels of interest rates are projected to remain at the current level in 2019 or slightly increase, absent any decreases in the Federal Funds rate.\nTotal expenses gross of expenses waived by the Sponsor ( Total expenses\u201d) for 2018 were $2,675,481; total expenses for 2017 were $2,678,613 and $1,854,582 in 2016. This represents a ($3,132) or 0% decrease for 2018 over 2017 and a $820,899 or 44% increase for 2018 over 2016. The decrease for 2018 over 2017 was driven by: 1) a ($5,614) or 1% decrease in management fee paid to the Sponsor due to lower average net assets; 2) a ($10,650) or 2% decrease in professional fees related to auditing, legal and tax preparation fees; 3) a ($17,521) or 12% decrease in custodian fees and expenses; and 4) a ($3,515) or 3% decrease in general and administrative expenses. These decreases were offset by increases in: 1) a $24,415 or 2% increase in distribution and marketing expenses; 2) a $26 or 0% increase in business permits and licenses; 3) a $4,159 or 7% increase in brokerage commissions due to an increase in contracts purchased and rolled; and 4) a $5,568 or 15% increase in other expenses. The decreases in operating expenses were due to expense controls under taken by the Sponsor and lower average net asset balance relative to the other Funds.\nThe increase for 2018 over 2016 was driven by increases in all expense categories period over period except for business permits and licenses, which decreased by ($18,357) or 47%. The increase was driven by: 1) a $233,446 or 56% increase in management fee paid to the Sponsor due to higher average net assets; 2) a $256,117 or 80% increase in professional fees related to auditing, legal and tax preparation fees; 3) a $317,276 or 41% increase in distribution and marketing expenses; 4) a $4,721 or 4% increase in custodian fees and expenses; 5) a $12,198 or 13% increase in general and administrative expenses; 6) a $15,470 or 32% increase in brokerage commissions due to an increase in contracts purchased and rolled; and 7) a $28 or 0% increase in other expenses. The increases year over year were generally due to higher average net assets relative to other funds. The total expense ratio gross of expenses waived by the Sponsor for these years was 4.13% in 2018, 4.09% in 2017, and 4.47% in 2016. The management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1% of the Fund's daily average net assets.\nThe Sponsor has the ability to elect to pay certain expenses on behalf of the Fund or waive the management fee. This election is subject to change by the Sponsor, at its discretion. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Sponsor waived fees of $234,736; the Sponsor has determined that no reimbursement will be sought in future periods for those expenses which have been waived for the year. The Sponsor permanently waived $323,244 of expenses in 2017 and $140,028 in 2016.\nTotal expenses net of expenses waived by the Sponsor and reimbursement to the Sponsor for previously waived expenses ( Total expenses, net\u201d) for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $2,440,745, $2,355,369, and $1,714,554 respectively. The total expense ratio net of expenses waived by the Sponsor periods was 3.76% in 2018, 3.60% in 2017, and 4.13% in 2016. Net investment loss, which includes the impact of expenses and interest income, was 1.69% in 2018, 2.46% in 2017, and 3.57% in 2016.\nOther than the management fee to the Sponsor and the brokerage commissions, most of the expenses incurred by the Fund are associated with the day-to-day operation of the Fund and the necessary functions related to regulatory compliance.

However, if total net assets for the Fund fall, the total expense ratio of the Fund will increase unless additional reductions are made by the Sponsor to the daily expense accrual. The Sponsor can elect to adjust the daily expense accruals at its discretion based on market conditions and other Fund considerations.\nNet cash provided by (used in) the Fund's operating activities during the period was $10,649,606 in 2018, ($4,660,527) in 2017 and ($14,596,770) in 2016. In 2018, proceeds from the sale of shares were $12,997,590 representing 2,000,000 shares while payments for redemption of shares were $19,278,980 representing 2,975,000 shares. In 2017, proceeds from the sale of shares were $35,809,657 representing 5,375,000 shares while payments for redemption of shares were $31,148,810 representing 4,175,000 shares. In 2016, proceeds from the sale of shares were $51,690,600 representing 6,475,000 shares while payments for the redemption of shares were $2,763,620 representing 325,000 shares.\nThe seasonality patterns for wheat futures prices are impacted by a variety of factors. These include, but are not limited to, the harvest in the fall, the planting conditions in the spring, and the weather throughout the critical germination and growing periods. Prices for wheat futures are affected by the availability and demand for substitute agricultural commodities, including corn and soybeans. The price of wheat futures contracts is also influenced by global economic conditions, including the demand for exports to other countries. Such factors will impact the performance of the Fund and the results of operations on an ongoing basis. The Sponsor cannot predict the impact of such factors.\nTeucrium Agricultural Fund\nThe Teucrium Agricultural Fund commenced operation on March 28, 2012. On April 22, 2011, an initial registration statement was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d). On February 10, 2012, the Fund's initial registration of 5,000,000 shares on Form S-1 was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d). On March 28, 2012, the Fund listed its shares on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol TAGS.\u201d On the business day prior to that, the Fund issued 300,000 shares in exchange for $15,000,000 at the Fund's initial NAV of $50 per share. The Fund also commenced investment operations on March 28, 2012 by purchasing shares of the Underlying Funds. On December 31, 2011, the Fund had two shares outstanding, which were owned by the Sponsor.\nThe investment objective of the Fund is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the Net Asset Value ( NAV\u201d) of its common units ( Shares\u201d) reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average (the Underlying Fund Average\u201d) of the NAVs per share of four other commodity pools that are series of the Trust and are sponsored by the Sponsor: the Teucrium Corn Fund ( CORN\u201d), the Teucrium Wheat Fund ( WEAT\u201d), the Teucrium Soybean Fund ( SOYB\u201d) and the Teucrium Sugar Fund ( CANE\u201d) (collectively, the Underlying Funds\u201d). The Underlying Fund Average will have a weighting of 25% to each Underlying Fund, and the Fund's assets will be rebalanced, generally on a daily basis, to maintain the approximate 25% allocation to each Underlying Fund. The Fund does not intend to invest directly in futures contracts ( Futures Contracts\u201d), although it reserves the right to do so in the future, including if an Underlying Fund ceases operations.\nThe investment objective of each Underlying Fund is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' NAV reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average of the closing settlement prices for certain Futures Contracts for the commodity specified in the Underlying Fund's name. (This weighted average is referred to herein as the Underlying Fund's Benchmark,\u201d the Futures Contracts that at any given time make up an Underlying Fund's Benchmark are referred to herein as the Underlying Fund's Benchmark Component Futures Contracts,\u201d and the commodity specified in the Underlying Fund's name is referred to herein as its Specified Commodity.\u201d) Specifically, the Teucrium Corn Fund's Benchmark is: (1) the second-to-expire Futures Contract for corn traded on the Chicago Board of Trade ( CBOT\u201d), weighted 35%, (2) the third-to-expire CBOT corn Futures Contract, weighted 30%, and (3) the CBOT corn Futures Contract expiring in the December following the expiration month of the third-to-expire contract, weighted 35%. The Teucrium Wheat Fund's Benchmark is: (1) the second-to-expire CBOT wheat Futures Contract, weighted 35%, (2) the third-to-expire CBOT wheat Futures Contract, weighted 30%, and (3) the CBOT wheat Futures Contract expiring in the December following the expiration month of the third-to-expire contract, weighted 35%. The Teucrium Soybean Fund's Benchmark is: (1) the second-to-expire CBOT soybean Futures Contract, weighted 35%, (2) the third-to-expire CBOT soybean Futures Contract, weighted 30%, and (3) the CBOT soybean Futures Contract expiring in the November following the expiration month of the third-to-expire contract, weighted 35%, except that CBOT soybean Futures Contracts expiring in August and September will not be part of the Teucrium Soybean Fund's Benchmark because of the less liquid market for these Futures Contracts. The Teucrium Sugar Fund's Benchmark is: (1) the second-to-expire Sugar No. 11 Futures Contract traded on ICE Futures US ( ICE Futures\u201d), weighted 35%, (2) the third-to-expire ICE Futures Sugar No. 11 Futures Contract, weighted 30%, and (3) the ICE Futures Sugar No. 11 Futures Contract expiring in the March following the expiration month of the third-to-expire contract, weighted 35%.\nOn December 31, 2018, the Fund held: 1) 23,808 shares of CORN with a fair value of $383,506; 2) 64,537 shares of WEAT with a fair value of $383,743; 3) 23,581 shares of SOYB with a fair value of $381,970; and 4) 52,924 shares of CANE with a fair value of $374,067.

There were no shares issued or redeemed in 2017 and 2016. Effective August 2, 2012 through April 9, 2018, the Fund was at 50,002 shares outstanding which represents a minimum number of shares and there could be no further redemptions until additional shares are created.\nTotal net assets for the Fund were $1,524,760 on December 31, 2018, compared to $1,137,639 on December 31, 2017 and $1,316,370 on December 31, 2016.

When comparing December 31, 2018 with 2017, there was an increase in total net assets of 34%, which was driven by a combination of a change in the NAV per share which decreased by ($2.42) or 11% and an increase in the number of shares outstanding of 50%. When comparing December 31, 2018 with 2016, there was an increase in total net assets of 16%, which was driven by a change in the NAV per share which decreased by ($6.00) or 23%.

Total loss for the period in 2017 and 2016 was ($172,520) and ($6,220), respectively. Realized gain or loss on the securities of the Underlying Funds is a function of: 1) the change in the price of particular contracts sold in relation to redemption of shares, and 2) the gain or loss associated with rebalancing trades which are made to ensure conformance to the benchmark. Unrealized gain or loss on the securities of the Underlying Funds is a function of the change in the price of shares held on the final date of the period versus the purchase price for each and the number held. The Sponsor has a static benchmark as described above and trades futures contracts to adhere to that benchmark and to adjust for the creation or redemption of shares.\nTotal expenses gross of expenses waived by the Sponsor ( Total expenses\u201d) for 2018 were $55,470; total expenses for 2017 were $46,481 and $45,259 in 2016.

The total expense ratio net of expenses waived by the Sponsor for these periods was 0.48% in 2018, 0.50% in 2017 and 0.50% in 2016.\nOther than the brokerage commissions, most of the expenses incurred by the Fund are associated with the day-to-day operation of the Fund and the necessary functions related to regulatory compliance. These are generally based on contracts, which extend for some period of time and up to one year, or commitments regardless of the level of assets under management. The structure of the Fund and the nature of the expenses are such that as total net assets grow, there is a scalability of expenses that may allow the net expense ratio to be reduced. As the Sponsor has initiated a percentage based daily expense accrual for the Fund, even if total net assets for the Fund fall, the total expense ratio of the Fund will not increase. The Sponsor can elect to adjust the daily expense accruals at its discretion based on market conditions and other Fund considerations.\nNet cash (used in) provided by the Fund's operating activities during the period was ($578,719) in 2018, $114 in 2017, and $545 in 2016. In 2018, proceeds from the sale of shares were $579,107 representing 25,000 shares and there were no payments for redemption baskets. There were no proceeds from creation baskets or payments for redemption baskets in 2017 or in 2016.\nBenchmark Performance\nThe Funds are new and have a limited operating history. Investing in Commodity Interests subjects the Funds to the risks of the underlying commodity market, and this could result in substantial fluctuations in the price of each Fund's Shares. Unlike mutual funds, the Funds generally will not distribute dividends to Shareholders. Investors may choose to use the Funds as a means of investing indirectly in the underlying commodity, and there are risks involved in such investments. The Sponsor has limited experience operating a commodity pool. Investors may choose to use the Funds as vehicles to hedge against the risk of loss, and there are risks involved in hedging activities.\nDuring the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, the average daily change in the NAV of each Fund was within plus/minus 10 percent of the average daily change in the Benchmark of the Fund, as stated in the prospectus for each Fund.\nFrequency Distribution of Premiums and Discounts\nDescription\nThe frequency distribution charts below present information about the difference between the daily market price for Shares of each Fund and the Fund's reported Net Asset Value per share. The amount that a Fund's market price is above the reported NAV is called the premium. The amount that a Fund's market price is below the reported NAV is called the discount. The market price is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the listing exchange, as of the time that a Fund's NAV is calculated (usually 4:00 p.m., New York time). The horizontal axis of the chart shows the premium or discount expressed in basis points. The vertical axis indicates the number of trading days in the period covered by the chart. Each bar in the chart shows the number of trading days in which a Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated. The charts are also available on the website for each Fund on a quarterly basis.\n*A unit that is equal to 1/100th of 1% and is used to denote the change in a financial instrument.\nNEITHER THE PAST PERFORMANCE OF A FUND NOR THE PRIOR INDEX LEVELS AND CHANGES, POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, SHOULD BE TAKEN AS AN INDICATION OF THE FUND'S FUTURE PERFORMANCE\nCORN\nThe performance data above for the Teucrium Corn Fund represents past performance.

Performance may be lower or higher than performance data quoted.\nTAGS\nThe performance data above for the Teucrium Agricultural Fund represents past performance. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Investment return and value of the Fund's Shares will fluctuate so that an investor's Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance may be lower or higher than performance data quoted.\nFor the period from August 2, 2012 through April 10, 2018, TAGS had 50,002 shares outstanding; this represents the minimum number of shares and, thus, no shares could be redeemed until additional shares have been created. This has generated a situation, at times, in which the spread between the bid/ask midpoint at 4pm and the NAV falls outside of the 1 to 49\u201d or -1 to -49\u201d range. The situation does not affect the actual NAV of the Fund. The Fund as of December 31, 2018 has 75,004 shares outstanding. Effective September 4, 2018, the Sponsor updated the number of Shares required for a Creation Basket or Redemption Basket from 25,000 shares of the Fund to 12,500 shares.\nOff Balance Sheet Financing\nAs of December 31, 2018, neither the Trust nor any of the Funds has any loan guarantees, credit support or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions relating to certain risks service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of the Funds. While the exposure of each Fund under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, they are not expected to have a material impact on the financial positions of each Fund.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Funds do not anticipate making use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet their obligations. The Funds meet their liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of their investments from the cash, cash equivalents and/or the Treasuries Securities that they intend to hold, and/or from the fee waivers provided by the Sponsor. The Funds' liquidity needs include: redeeming their shares, providing margin deposits for existing Futures Contracts or the purchase of additional Futures Contracts, posting collateral for over-the-counter Commodity Interests, and paying expenses.\nThe Funds generate cash primarily from (i) the sale of Creation Baskets and (ii) interest earned on cash and cash equivalents. Generally, all of the net assets of the Funds are allocated to trading in Commodity Interests. Most of the assets of the Funds are held in cash and/or cash equivalents. The percentage that such assets bear to the total net assets will vary from period to period as the market values of the Commodity Interests change. Interest earned on interest-bearing assets of a Fund are paid to that Fund.\nThe investments of a Fund in Commodity Interests are subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons. For example, U.S. futures exchanges limit the fluctuations in the prices of certain Futures Contracts during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits.\u201d During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of such a Futures Contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the contracts can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Such market conditions could prevent the Fund from promptly liquidating a position in Futures Contracts.\nMarket Risk\nTrading in Commodity Interests such as Futures Contracts will involve the Funds entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell specific amounts of commodities at a specified date in the future. The gross or face amount of the contracts is expected to significantly exceed the future cash requirements of each Fund as each Fund intends to close out any open positions prior to the contractual expiration date. As a result, each Fund's market risk is the risk of loss arising from the decline in value of the contracts, not from the need to make delivery under the contracts. The Funds consider the fair value\u201d of derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts. The market risk associated with the commitment by the Funds to purchase a specific commodity will be limited to the aggregate face amount of the contacts held.\nThe exposure of the Funds to market risk will depend on a number of factors including the markets for the specific commodity, the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the liquidity of the commodity-specific Interest markets and the relationships among the contracts held by each Fund.\nCredit Risk\nWhen any of the Funds enter into Commodity Interests, it will be exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations. For purposes of credit risk, the counterparty for the Futures Contracts traded on the CBOT and ICE is the clearinghouse associated with those exchanges. In general, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members, which should significantly reduce credit risk. Some foreign exchanges are not backed by their clearinghouse members but may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. Unlike in the case of exchange-traded futures contracts, the counterparty to an over-the-counter Commodity Interest contract is generally a single bank or other financial institution. As a result, there will be greater counterparty credit risk in over-the-counter transactions. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to any of the Funds.\nThe Funds may engage in off exchange transactions broadly called an exchange for risk\u201d transaction, also referred to as an exchange for swap.\u201d For purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act and related CFTC rules, an exchange for risk\u201d transaction is treated as a swap.\u201d An exchange for risk\u201d transaction, sometimes referred to as an exchange for swap\u201d or exchange of futures for risk,\u201d is a privately negotiated and simultaneous exchange of a futures contract position for a swap or other over-the-counter instrument on the corresponding commodity. An exchange for risk transaction can be used by the Funds as a technique to avoid taking physical delivery of a commodity futures contract, corn for example, in that a counterparty will take the Fund's position in a Corn Futures Contract into its own account in exchange for a swap that does not by its terms call for physical delivery. The Funds will become subject to the credit risk of a counterparty when it acquires an over-the-counter position in an exchange for risk transaction. The Fund may use an exchange for risk\u201d transaction in connection with the creation and redemption of shares. These transactions must be carried out only in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange where the futures contracts trade.\nThe Sponsor will attempt to manage the credit risk of each Fund by following certain trading limitations and policies. In particular, each Fund intends to post margin and collateral and/or hold liquid assets that will be equal to approximately the face amount of the Interests it holds. The Sponsor will implement procedures that will include, but will not be limited to, executing and clearing trades and entering into over-the-counter transactions only with parties it deems creditworthy and/or requiring the posting of collateral by such parties for the benefit of each Fund to limit its credit exposure.\nThe CEA requires all FCMs, such as the Funds' clearing brokers, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers' funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC. The CFTC has similar authority over introducing brokers, or persons who solicit or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades. The CEA authorizes the CFTC to regulate trading by FCMs and by their officers and directors, permits the CFTC to require action by exchanges in the event of market emergencies, and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from alleged violations of the CEA. The CEA also gives the states powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC.\nOn November 14, 2013, the CFTC published final regulations that require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for FCMs. The rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner, the capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations and the auditing and examination programs of the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough manner.\nED&F Man Capital Markets Inc. ( ED&F Man\u201d) is the Funds' FCM and the clearing broker to execute and clear the Funds' futures and provide other brokerage-related services.\nThe Funds, other than TAGS, will generally retain cash positions of approximately 95% of total net assets; this balance represents the total net assets less the initial margin requirements held by the FCM. These cash assets are either: 1) deposited by the Sponsor in demand deposit accounts of financial institutions which are deemed by the Sponsor to be of investment level quality, 2) held in a money-market fund which is deemed to be a cash equivalent under the most recent SEC definition, or 3) held in a cash equivalent with a maturity of 90 days or less that is deemed by the Sponsor to be of investment level quality.", "summary": "The report provides the financial analysis and operations of the Teucrium Corn Fund, including discussions on critical accounting policies, trust overview, and results of operations. It notes that the fund's expenses and net assets decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 and 2016, and the total loss for the fund was primarily due to changes in commodity futures contracts and interest income.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto of the Teucrium Commodity Trust and all of the Funds which are series of the Trust included elsewhere in the annual report on Form 10-K.\nThis annual report on Form 10-K, including this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d contains forward-looking statements by terminology such as may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d expect,\u201d plan,\u201d anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d predict,\u201d potential\u201d or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. All statements (other than statements of historical fact) included in this filing that address activities, events or developments that will or may occur in the future, including such matters as movements in the commodities markets and indexes that track such movements, operations of the Funds, the Sponsor's plans and references to the future success of a Fund or the Funds and other similar matters, are forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially.\nThese statements are based upon certain assumptions and analyses the Sponsor has made based on its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors appropriate in the circumstances. Whether or not actual results and developments will conform to the Sponsor's expectations and predictions, however, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the special considerations discussed in this prospectus, general economic, market and business conditions, changes in laws or regulations, including those concerning taxes, made by governmental authorities or regulatory bodies, and other world economic and political developments. Consequently, all the forward-looking statements made in this filing are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that actual results or developments the Sponsor anticipates will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the expected consequences to, or have the expected effects on, the operations of the Funds or the value of the Shares of the Funds.\nTrust Overview\nThe business and operations of the Trust and each Fund are described above under Part I, Item I entitled Business.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Trust's critical accounting policies for all the Funds are as follows:\n1.\nPreparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally-accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates, and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period of the combined financial statements and accompanying notes. The Trust's application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used.\n2.\nThe Sponsor has determined that the valuation of Commodity Interests that are not traded on a U.S. or internationally recognized futures exchange (such as swaps and other over-the-counter contracts) involves a critical accounting policy. The values which are used by the Funds for futures contracts will be provided by the commodity broker who will use market prices when available, while over-the-counter contracts will be valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date. Values will be determined on a daily basis.\n3.\nCommodity futures contracts held by the Funds are recorded on the trade date. All such transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis and marked to market daily. Unrealized appreciation or depreciation on commodity futures contracts are reflected in the statement of operations as the difference between the original contract amount and the fair market value as of the last business day of the year or as of the last date of the financial statements. Changes in the appreciation or depreciation between periods are reflected in the statement of operations. Interest on cash equivalents and deposits are recognized on the accrual basis. The Funds earn interest on funds held at the custodian or other financial institutions at prevailing market rates for such investments.\n4.\nCash and cash equivalents are cash held at financial institutions in demand-deposit accounts or highly-liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less at inception. The Funds reported cash equivalents in the statements of assets and liabilities at market value, or at carrying amounts that approximate fair value, because of their highly-liquid nature and short-term maturities. The Funds have a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with banks. Assets deposited with financial institutions may, at times, exceed federally insured limits.\n5.\nThe use of fair value to measure financial instruments, with related unrealized gains or losses recognized in earnings in each period is fundamental to the Trust's financial statements. In accordance with GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price\u201d) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nIn determining fair value, the Trust uses various valuation approaches. In accordance with GAAP, a fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Trust. Unobservable inputs reflect the Trust's assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels: a) Level 1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Trust has the ability to access. Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to Level 1 securities and financial instruments. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these securities and financial instruments does not entail a significant degree of judgment, b) Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, and c) Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. See the notes within the financial statements for further information.\nThe Funds and the Trust record their derivative activities at fair value. Gains and losses from derivative contracts are included in the statement of operations. Derivative contracts include futures contracts related to commodity prices. Futures, which are listed on a national securities exchange, such as the CBOT or the Intercontinental Exchange ( ICE\u201d), or reported on another national market, are generally categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. OTC derivatives contracts (such as forward and swap contracts) which may be valued using models, depending on whether significant inputs are observable or unobservable, are categorized in Levels 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n6.\nBrokerage commissions on all open commodity futures contracts are accrued on a full-turn basis.\n7.\nMargin is the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited by a commodity interest trader with the trader's broker to initiate and maintain an open position in futures contracts. A margin deposit acts to assure the trader's performance of the futures contracts purchased or sold. Futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on initial margin that represents a very small percentage of the aggregate purchase or sales price of the contract. Because of such low margin requirements, price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that, in relation to the amount invested, are greater than are customary in other forms of investment or speculation. As discussed below, adverse price changes in the futures contract may result in margin requirements that greatly exceed the initial margin. In addition, the amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract. Brokerage firms, such as the Funds' clearing brokers, carrying accounts for traders in commodity interest contracts generally require higher amounts of margin as a matter of policy to further protect themselves. Over-the-counter trading generally involves the extension of credit between counterparties, so the counterparties may agree to require the posting of collateral by one or both parties to address credit exposure.\nWhen a trader purchases an option, there is no margin requirement; however, the option premium must be paid in full. When a trader sells an option, on the other hand, he or she is required to deposit margin in an amount determined by the margin requirements established for the underlying interest and, in addition, an amount substantially equal to the current premium for the option. The margin requirements imposed on the selling of options, although adjusted to reflect the probability that out-of-the-money options will not be exercised, can in fact be higher than those imposed in dealing in the futures markets directly. Complicated margin requirements apply to spreads and conversions, which are complex trading strategies in which a trader acquires a mixture of options positions and positions in the underlying interest.\nOngoing or maintenance\u201d margin requirements are computed each day by a trader's clearing broker. When the market value of a particular open futures contract changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements, a margin call is made by the broker. If the margin call is not met within a reasonable time, the broker may close out the trader's position. With respect to the Funds' trading, the Funds (and not its shareholders personally) are subject to margin calls.\nFinally, many major U.S. exchanges have passed certain cross margining arrangements involving procedures pursuant to which the futures and options positions held in an account would, in the case of some accounts, be aggregated, and margin requirements would be assessed on a portfolio basis, measuring the total risk of the combined positions.\n8.\nDue from/to broker for investments in financial instruments are securities transactions pending settlement. The Trust and TAGS are subject to credit risk to the extent any broker with whom it conducts business is unable to fulfill contractual obligations on its behalf. The management of the Trust and the Funds monitors the financial condition of such brokers and does not anticipate any losses from these counterparties. Since the inception of the Fund, the principal broker through which the Trust and TAGS clear securities transactions for TAGS is the Bank of New York Mellon Capital Markets.\n9.\nThe investment objective of TAGS is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the Net Asset Value ( NAV\u201d) of its common units ( Shares\u201d) reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average (the Underlying Fund Average\u201d) of the NAVs per share of four other commodity pools that are series of the Trust and are sponsored by the Sponsor: the Teucrium Corn Fund, the Teucrium Wheat Fund, the Teucrium Soybean Fund and the Teucrium Sugar Fund (collectively, the Underlying Funds\u201d). The Underlying Fund Average will have a weighting of 25% to each Underlying Fund, and the Fund's assets will be rebalanced, generally on a daily basis, to maintain the approximate 25% allocation to each Underlying Fund. As such, TAGS will buy, sell and hold as part of its normal operations shares of the four Underlying Funds. The Trust excludes the shares of the other series of the Trust owned by the Teucrium Agricultural Fund from its statements of assets and liabilities. The Trust excludes the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on securities owned by the Teucrium Agricultural Fund from its statements of operations. Upon the sale of the Underlying Funds by the Teucrium Agricultural Fund, the Trust includes any realized gain or loss in its statements of changes in net assets.\n10.\nFor tax purposes, the Funds will be treated as partnerships. Therefore, the Funds do not record a provision for income taxes because the partners report their share of a Fund's income or loss on their income tax returns. The financial statements reflect the Funds' transactions without adjustment, if any, required for income tax purposes.\n11.\nThe Sponsor is responsible for investing the assets of the Funds in accordance with the objectives and policies of each Fund. The Funds pay for all brokerage fees, taxes and other expenses, including licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, registration or other fees paid to the SEC, FINRA, formerly the National Association of Securities Dealers, or any other regulatory agency in connection with the offer and sale of subsequent Shares after its initial registration and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated therewith. The Fund also pays its portion of the fees and expenses for services directly attributable to the Fund such as accounting, financial reporting, regulatory compliance and trading activities, which the Sponsor elected not to outsource. Certain aggregate expenses common to all Teucrium Funds within the Trust are allocated by the Sponsor to the respective funds based on activity drivers deemed most appropriate by the Sponsor for such expenses, including but not limited to relative assets under management and creation order activity. These aggregate common expenses include, but are not limited to, legal, auditing, accounting and financial reporting, tax-preparation, regulatory compliance, trading activities, and insurance costs, as well as fees paid to the Distributor. A portion of these aggregate common expenses are related to the Sponsor or related parties of principals of the Sponsor; these are necessary services to the Teucrium Funds, which are primarily the cost of performing certain accounting and financial reporting, regulatory compliance, and trading activities that are directly attributable to the Fund and are included, primarily, in distribution and marketing fees. In addition, the Funds, except for TAGS which has no such fee, are contractually obligated to pay a monthly management fee to the Sponsor, based on average daily net assets, at a rate equal to 1.00% per annum.\n12.\nThe Funds pay for all brokerage fees, taxes and other expenses, including licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, registration or other fees paid to the SEC, FINRA, formerly the National Association of Securities Dealers, or any other regulatory agency in connection with the offer and sale of subsequent Shares, after its initial registration, and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated therewith. The Funds also pay the fees and expenses associated with the Trust's tax accounting and reporting requirements. Certain aggregate expenses common to all Funds within the Trust are allocated by the Sponsor to the respective Fund based on activity drivers deemed most appropriate by the Sponsor for such expenses, including but not limited to relative assets under management and creation and redeem order activity. These aggregate common expenses include, but are not limited to, legal, auditing, accounting and financial reporting, tax-preparation, regulatory compliance, trading activities, and insurance costs, as well as fees paid to the Distributor, which are included in the related line item in the combined statements of operations. A portion of these aggregate common expenses are related to the Sponsor or related parties of principals of the Sponsor; these are necessary services to the Trust and the Funds, which are primarily the cost of performing accounting and financial reporting, regulatory compliance, and trading activities that are directly attributable to the Trust and the Funds. Such expenses are primarily included as distribution and marketing fees.\n13.\nFor commercial paper, the Funds use the effective interest method for calculating the actual interest rate in a period based on the amount of a financial instrument's book value at the beginning of the accounting period. Accretion on these investments are recognized on the effective interest method in U.S. dollars and recognized in cash equivalents. All discounts on purchase prices of debt securities are accreted over the life of the respective security.\nResults of Operations\nThe discussion below addresses the material changes in the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. CORN, SOYB, CANE WEAT and TAGS operated for the entirety of all periods discussed below.\nTotal expenses for the current and comparative periods are presented both gross and net of any expenses waived or paid by the Sponsor that would have been incurred by the Funds ( expenses waived by the Sponsor\u201d). For all expenses waived in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the Sponsor has determined that no reimbursement will be sought in future periods. Total expenses, net\u201d, which is after the impact of any expenses waived by or reimbursed to the Sponsor, are presented in the same manner as previously reported. There is, therefore, no impact to or change in the net gain or net loss in any period for the Trust and each Fund as a result of this change in presentation.\nIn accordance with ASU 2016-18 issued by the FASB, the presentation of restricted cash on the financial statements for the period ending December 31, 2017 was updated to be included in Cash and Cash Equivalents\u201d on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities and the Statements of Cash Flows, and as specified in the Notes to the Financial Statements under Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\u201d. This presentation did not have a material impact on the financial statements and disclosures of the Trust and the Funds. Effective October 2017, for all funds the balance for restricted cash held in custody at the Bank of New York Mellon was $0.\nThe Sponsor is responsible for investing the assets of the Fund in accordance with the objectives and policies of the Fund. In addition, the Sponsor arranges for one or more third parties to provide administrative, custodial, accounting, transfer agency and other necessary services to the Fund, including services directly attributable to the Fund such as accounting, financial reporting, regulatory compliance and trading activities, which the Sponsor elected not to outsource. In addition, the Funds, except for TAGS which has no such fee, are contractually obligated to pay a monthly management fee to the Sponsor, based on average daily net assets, at a rate equal to 1.00% per annum.\nThe Fund generally pays for all brokerage fees, taxes and other expenses, including licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, registration or other fees paid to the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA\u201d), or any other regulatory agency in connection with the offer and sale of subsequent Shares after its initial registration and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated therewith. Each Fund also pays its portion of the fees and expenses associated with the Trust's tax accounting and reporting requirements. Certain aggregate expenses common to all Funds within the Trust are allocated by the Sponsor to the respective funds based on activity drivers deemed most appropriate by the Sponsor for such expenses, including but not limited to relative assets under management and creation order activity. These aggregate common expenses include, but are not limited to, legal, auditing, accounting and financial reporting, tax-preparation, regulatory compliance, trading activities, and insurance costs, as well as fees paid to the Distributor, which are included in the related line item in the statements of operations. A portion of these aggregate common expenses are related to services provided by the Sponsor or related parties of principals of the Sponsor; these are necessary services to the Funds, which are primarily the cost of performing accounting and financial reporting, regulatory compliance, and trading activities that are directly attributable to the Funds and are, primarily, included as distribution and marketing fees on the statements of operations. These amounts, for the Trust and for each Fund, are detailed in the notes to the financial statements included in Part II of this filing.\nThe Sponsor has the ability to elect to pay certain expenses on behalf of the Funds or waive the management fee. This election is subject to change by the Sponsor, at its discretion. Expenses paid by the Sponsor and Management fees waived by the Sponsor are, if applicable, presented as waived expenses in the statements of operations for each Fund.\nFor the period January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018, the Funds, in total, recorded an increase in expenses, gross and net of any expenses waived by the Sponsor, over what had been recorded in 2017. For the year ending December 31, 2018, total expenses gross of any waived expenses, were $7,411,981, while total expenses, net were $6,184,551. For the year 2017, these were, $6,580,718 and $5,551,819, respectively. For 2016, these were $6,146,659 and $5,308,644, respectively. The increase in expenses for the period 2018 compared to 2017, gross of any waived expenses, was $831,263 which was driven by increases in all expense categories, specifically: 1) a $146,381 or 10% increase in management fees paid to the Sponsor; 2) a $112,954 or 8% increase in professional fees related to auditing, legal and tax preparation fees; 3) a $475,185 or 18% increase in distribution and marketing fees; 4) a $4,066 or 1% increase in custodian fees and expenses; 5) a $22,100 or 24% increase in business permits and licenses; 6) a $7,584 or 3% increase in general and administrative expenses; 7) a $36,347 or 23% increase in brokerage commissions due to an increase in contracts purchased and rolled; and 8) a $26,646 or 28% increase in other expenses. The 13% increase in expenses year over year was generally due to higher average net assets. Total expenses, net of expenses waived by the Sponsor, increased by $632,732 for 2018 compared to 2017 due to the increase in gross expenses, which was partially offset by an increase of $198,531 in expenses waived by the Sponsor.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, no reimbursement to the Sponsor will be sought in any future period for expenses that have been identified as waived by the Sponsor.\nTeucrium Corn Fund\nThe Teucrium Corn Fund commenced investment operations on June 9, 2010. The investment objective of the Corn Fund is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the Shares' NAV reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average of the closing settlement prices for three futures contracts for corn ( Corn Futures Contracts\u201d) that are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade ( CBOT\u201d), specifically (1) the second-to-expire CBOT Corn Futures Contract, weighted 35%, (2) the third-to-expire CBOT Corn Futures Contract, weighted 30%, and (3) the CBOT Corn Futures Contract expiring in the December following the expiration month of the third-to-expire contract, weighted 35%. On December 31, 2018, the Corn Fund held a total of 2,889 CBOT Corn Futures contracts with a notional value of $56,379,850. Of these, 1,030 contracts had an asset fair value of $107,363, while 1,859 contracts had a liability fair value of $1,297,288. The weighting of the notional value of the contracts was weighted as follows: (1) 35% to the MAY19 contracts, the second-to-expire CBOT Corn Futures Contract, (2) 30% to JUL19 CBOT contracts, the third-to-expire CBOT Corn Futures Contract, and (3) 35% to DEC19 CBOT contracts, the CBOT Corn Futures Contract expiring in the December following the expiration month of the third-to-expire contract.\nThe benchmark for the Fund is the Teucrium Corn Index (TCORN) which is defined as: A weighted average of daily changes in the closing settlement prices of (1) the second-to-expire Corn Futures Contract traded on the CBOT, weighted 35%, (2) the third-to-expire CBOT Corn Futures Contract, weighted 30%, and (3) the CBOT Corn Futures Contract expiring in the December following the expiration month of third-to-expire contract, weighted 35%. To convert to an index, 100 is set to $25, the opening day price of CORN.\nThe chart below shows the percent change in the NAV per share for the Fund, the market price of the Fund shares, represented by the closing price of the Fund on the NYSE Arca or the mid-point of the 4 pm bid and ask if no closing price is available, and TCORN for two periods. One period is December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2018. The second period is from the commencement of operations to December 31, 2018. The Benchmark does not reflect any impact of expenses, which would generally reduce the Fund's NAV, or interest income, which would generally increase the NAV. The actual results for the NAV do include the impacts of both expenses and interest income.\n\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nOn December 31, 2018, the Fund had 3,500,004 shares outstanding and net assets of $56,379,057. This is in comparison to 3,875,004 shares outstanding and net assets of $64,901,479 on December 31, 2017 and 3,900,004 shares outstanding with net assets of $73,213,541 on December 31, 2016. Shares outstanding decreased by 375,000 or 10% for the period of 2018 when compared to 2017. This slight decrease was, in the opinion of management, due to the uncertainty in the market due to the trade dispute with China. In total, the Fund issued 1,525,000 shares and purchased 1,900,000 shares, in 2018, as part of creation and redemption baskets. For the period 2018 compared to 2016, there was a decrease in shares outstanding of 400,000 or 10%. In total, in 2017, the Fund issued 1,325,000 shares and purchased 1,350,000 shares as part of creation and redemption baskets.\nTotal net assets for the Fund were $56,379,057 on December 31, 2018, compared to $64,901,479 on December 31, 2017 and $73,213,541 on December 31, 2016. The Net Asset Values ( NAV\u201d) per share related to these balances were $16.11, $16.75, and $18.77 respectively. When comparing December 31, 2018 with 2017, there was a decrease in total net assets of 13%, driven by a combination of a decrease in the number of shares outstanding of 375,000 or 10% and a decrease in the NAV per share of ($0.64) or 4%. When comparing December 31, 2018 with 2016, there was a decrease in total net assets of 23%, driven by a combination of an decrease in the number of shares outstanding of 400,000 or 10% and a change in the NAV per share which decreased by ($2.66) or 14%. The closing prices per share for 2018, 2017 and 2016, as reported by the NYSE Arca, were $16.05, $16.77, and $18.71, respectively. The change from December 31, 2018 over prior years was a 4% decrease from 2017 and a 14% decrease from 2016.\nThe graph below shows the actual shares outstanding, total net assets (or AUM) and net asset value per share (NAV per share) for the Fund from inception to December 31, 2018 and serves to illustrate the relative changes of these components.\nThe total loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 was ($892,853) resulting primarily from the net change in realized loss on commodity futures contracts totaling ($3,025,313), and by a net change in unrealized appreciation of commodity futures contracts of $651,638. Total loss was ($5,205,716) in 2017, and ($6,594,484) in 2016. Realized gain or loss on trading of commodity futures contracts is a function of: 1) the change in the price of the particular contracts sold as part of a roll\u201d in contracts as the nearest to expire contracts are exchanged for the appropriate contact given the investment objective of the fund, 2) the change in the price of particular contracts sold in relation to redemption of shares, 3) the gain or loss associated with rebalancing trades which are made to ensure conformance to the benchmark and 4) the number of contracts held and then sold for either circumstance aforementioned. Unrealized gain or loss on trading of commodity futures contracts is a function of the change in the price of contracts held on the final date of the period versus the purchase price for each contract and the number of contracts held in each contract month. The Sponsor has a static benchmark as described above and trades futures contracts to adhere to that benchmark and to adjust for the creation or redemption of shares.\nInterest income for year ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, was $1,480,822, $778,560, and $396,679. This increase year-over-year was the result of the Sponsor investing, at times, a portion of the available cash for the Fund in alternative demand deposit savings accounts with more attractive overnight deposit rates. Effective October 3, 2017, the Fund invested in investment grade commercial paper with maturities of ninety days or less. These investments provide a higher rate than money market products offered in the past. Interest rates paid on cash balances of the Fund have increased beginning March 2017 and have continued to increase through December 2018. These higher levels of interest rates are projected to remain at the current level in 2019 or slightly increase, absent any decreases in the Federal Funds rate.\nTotal expenses gross of expenses waived by the Sponsor ( Total expenses\u201d) for 2018 were $2,801,361; total expenses for 2017 were $2,918,936 and $3,411,916 in 2016. This represents a ($117,575) or 4% decrease for 2018 over 2017 and a ($610,555) or 18% decrease for 2018 over 2016. The decrease for 2018 over 2017 was driven by: 1) a ($93,280) or 15% decrease in professional fees related to auditing, legal and tax preparation fees; and 2) a ($12,937) or 1% decrease in distribution and marketing fees; 3) a ($26,510) or 17% decrease in custodian fees and expenses; 4) a ($2,590) or 10% decrease in business permits and licenses; and 5) a ($17,286) or 14% decrease in general and administrative expenses. These decreases were partially offset by: 1) a $21,330 or 3% increase in management fee paid to the Sponsor as a result of higher average net assets;", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto of the Teucrium Commodity Trust and all of the Funds which are series of the Trust included elsewhere in the annual report on Form 10-K.\nThis annual report on Form 10-K, including this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d contains forward-looking statements by terminology such as may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d expect,\u201d plan,\u201d anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d predict,\u201d potential\u201d or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. All statements (other than statements of historical fact) included in this filing that address activities, events or developments that will or may occur in the future, including such matters as movements in the commodities markets and indexes that track such movements, operations of the Funds, the Sponsor's plans and references to the future success of a Fund or the Funds and other similar matters, are forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially.\nThese statements are based upon certain assumptions and analyses the Sponsor has made based on its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors appropriate in the circumstances. Whether or not actual results and developments will conform to the Sponsor's expectations and predictions, however, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the special considerations discussed in this prospectus, general economic, market and business conditions, changes in laws or regulations, including those concerning taxes, made by governmental authorities or regulatory bodies, and other world economic and political developments. Consequently, all the forward-looking statements made in this filing are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that actual results or developments the Sponsor anticipates will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the expected consequences to, or have the expected effects on, the operations of the Funds or the value of the Shares of the Funds.\nTrust Overview\nThe business and operations of the Trust and each Fund are described above under Part I, Item I entitled Business.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Trust's critical accounting policies for all the Funds are as follows:\n1.\nPreparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally-accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates, and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period of the combined financial statements and accompanying notes. The Trust's application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used.\n2.\nThe Sponsor has determined that the valuation of Commodity Interests that are not traded on a U.S. or internationally recognized futures exchange (such as swaps and other over-the-counter contracts) involves a critical accounting policy. The values which are used by the Funds for futures contracts will be provided by the commodity broker who will use market prices when available, while over-the-counter contracts will be valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date. Values will be determined on a daily basis.\n3.\nCommodity futures contracts held by the Funds are recorded on the trade date. All such transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis and marked to market daily. Unrealized appreciation or depreciation on commodity futures contracts are reflected in the statement of operations as the difference between the original contract amount and the fair market value as of the last business day of the year or as of the last date of the financial statements. Changes in the appreciation or depreciation between periods are reflected in the statement of operations. Interest on cash equivalents and deposits are recognized on the accrual basis. The Funds earn interest on funds held at the custodian or other financial institutions at prevailing market rates for such investments.\n4.\nCash and cash equivalents are cash held at financial institutions in demand-deposit accounts or highly-liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less at inception. The Funds reported cash equivalents in the statements of assets and liabilities at market value, or at carrying amounts that approximate fair value, because of their highly-liquid nature and short-term maturities. The Funds have a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with banks. Assets deposited with financial institutions may, at times, exceed federally insured limits.\n5.\nThe use of fair value to measure financial instruments, with related unrealized gains or losses recognized in earnings in each period is fundamental to the Trust's financial statements. In accordance with GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price\u201d) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nIn determining fair value, the Trust uses various valuation approaches. In accordance with GAAP, a fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Trust. Unobservable inputs reflect the Trust's assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels: a) Level 1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Trust has the ability to access. Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to Level 1 securities and financial instruments. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these securities and financial instruments does not entail a significant degree of judgment, b) Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, and c) Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. See the notes within the financial statements for further information.\nThe Funds and the Trust record their derivative activities at fair value. Gains and losses from derivative contracts are included in the statement of operations. Derivative contracts include futures contracts related to commodity prices. Futures, which are listed on a national securities exchange, such as the CBOT or the Intercontinental Exchange ( ICE\u201d), or reported on another national market, are generally categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. OTC derivatives contracts (such as forward and swap contracts) which may be valued using models, depending on whether significant inputs are observable or unobservable, are categorized in Levels 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n6.\nBrokerage commissions on all open commodity futures contracts are accrued on a full-turn basis.\n7.\nMargin is the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited by a commodity interest trader with the trader's broker to initiate and maintain an open position in futures contracts. A margin deposit acts to assure the trader's performance of the futures contracts purchased or sold. Futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on initial margin that represents a very small percentage of the aggregate purchase or sales price of the contract. Because of such low margin requirements, price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that, in relation to the amount invested, are greater than are customary in other forms of investment or speculation. As discussed below, adverse price changes in the futures contract may result in margin requirements that greatly exceed the initial margin. In addition, the amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract. Brokerage firms, such as the Funds' clearing brokers, carrying accounts for traders in commodity interest contracts generally require higher amounts of margin as a matter of policy to further protect themselves. Over-the-counter trading generally involves the extension of credit between counterparties, so the counterparties may agree to require the posting of collateral by one or both parties to address credit exposure.\nWhen a trader purchases an option, there is no margin requirement; however, the option premium must be paid in full. When a trader sells an option, on the other hand, he or she is required to deposit margin in an amount determined by the margin requirements established for the underlying interest and, in addition, an amount substantially equal to the current premium for the option. The margin requirements imposed on the selling of options, although adjusted to reflect the probability that out-of-the-money options will not be exercised, can in fact be higher than those imposed in dealing in the futures markets directly. Complicated margin requirements apply to spreads and conversions, which are complex trading strategies in which a trader acquires a mixture of options positions and positions in the underlying interest.\nOngoing or maintenance\u201d margin requirements are computed each day by a trader's clearing broker. When the market value of a particular open futures contract changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements, a margin call is made by the broker. If the margin call is not met within a reasonable time, the broker may close out the trader's position. With respect to the Funds' trading, the Funds (and not its shareholders personally) are subject to margin calls.\nFinally, many major U.S. exchanges have passed certain cross margining arrangements involving procedures pursuant to which the futures and options positions held in an account would, in the case of some accounts, be aggregated, and margin requirements would be assessed on a portfolio basis, measuring the total risk of the combined positions.\n8.\nDue from/to broker for investments in financial instruments are securities transactions pending settlement. The Trust and TAGS are subject to credit risk to the extent any broker with whom it conducts business is unable to fulfill contractual obligations on its behalf. The management of the Trust and the Funds monitors the financial condition of such brokers and does not anticipate any losses from these counterparties. Since the inception of the Fund, the principal broker through which the Trust and TAGS clear securities transactions for TAGS is the Bank of New York Mellon Capital Markets.\n9.\nThe investment objective of TAGS is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the Net Asset Value ( NAV\u201d) of its common units ( Shares\u201d) reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average (the Underlying Fund Average\u201d) of the NAVs per share of four other commodity pools that are series of the Trust and are sponsored by the Sponsor: the Teucrium Corn Fund, the Teucrium Wheat Fund, the Teucrium Soybean Fund and the Teucrium Sugar Fund (collectively, the Underlying Funds\u201d). The Underlying Fund Average will have a weighting of 25% to each Underlying Fund, and the Fund's assets will be rebalanced, generally on a daily basis, to maintain the approximate 25% allocation to each Underlying Fund. As such, TAGS will buy, sell and hold as part of its normal operations shares of the four Underlying Funds. The Trust excludes the shares of the other series of the Trust owned by the Teucrium Agricultural Fund from its statements of assets and liabilities. The Trust excludes the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on securities owned by the Teucrium Agricultural Fund from its statements of operations. Upon the sale of the Underlying Funds by the Teucrium Agricultural Fund, the Trust includes any realized gain or loss in its statements of changes in net assets.\n10.\nFor tax purposes, the Funds will be treated as partnerships. Therefore, the Funds do not record a provision for income taxes because the partners report their share of a Fund's income or loss on their income tax returns. The financial statements reflect the Funds' transactions without adjustment, if any, required for income tax purposes.\n11.\nThe Sponsor is responsible for investing the assets of the Funds in accordance with the objectives and policies of each Fund. The Funds pay for all brokerage fees, taxes and other expenses, including licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, registration or other fees paid to the SEC, FINRA, formerly the National Association of Securities Dealers, or any other regulatory agency in connection with the offer and sale of subsequent Shares after its initial registration and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated therewith. The Fund also pays its portion of the fees and expenses for services directly attributable to the Fund such as accounting, financial reporting, regulatory compliance and trading activities, which the Sponsor elected not to outsource. Certain aggregate expenses common to all Teucrium Funds within the Trust are allocated by the Sponsor to the respective funds based on activity drivers deemed most appropriate by the Sponsor for such expenses, including but not limited to relative assets under management and creation order activity. These aggregate common expenses include, but are not limited to, legal, auditing, accounting and financial reporting, tax-preparation, regulatory compliance, trading activities, and insurance costs, as well as fees paid to the Distributor. A portion of these aggregate common expenses are related to the Sponsor or related parties of principals of the Sponsor; these are necessary services to the Teucrium Funds, which are primarily the cost of performing certain accounting and financial reporting, regulatory compliance, and trading activities that are directly attributable to the Fund and are included, primarily, in distribution and marketing fees. In addition, the Funds, except for TAGS which has no such fee, are contractually obligated to pay a monthly management fee to the Sponsor, based on average daily net assets, at a rate equal to 1.00% per annum.\n12.\nThe Funds pay for all brokerage fees, taxes and other expenses, including licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, registration or other fees paid to the SEC, FINRA, formerly the National Association of Securities Dealers, or any other regulatory agency in connection with the offer and sale of subsequent Shares, after its initial registration, and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated therewith. The Funds also pay the fees and expenses associated with the Trust's tax accounting and reporting requirements. Certain aggregate expenses common to all Funds within the Trust are allocated by the Sponsor to the respective Fund based on activity drivers deemed most appropriate by the Sponsor for such expenses, including but not limited to relative assets under management and creation and redeem order activity. These aggregate common expenses include, but are not limited to, legal, auditing, accounting and financial reporting, tax-preparation, regulatory compliance, trading activities, and insurance costs, as well as fees paid to the Distributor, which are included in the related line item in the combined statements of operations. A portion of these aggregate common expenses are related to the Sponsor or related parties of principals of the Sponsor; these are necessary services to the Trust and the Funds, which are primarily the cost of performing accounting and financial reporting, regulatory compliance, and trading activities that are directly attributable to the Trust and the Funds. Such expenses are primarily included as distribution and marketing fees.\n13.\nFor commercial paper, the Funds use the effective interest method for calculating the actual interest rate in a period based on the amount of a financial instrument's book value at the beginning of the accounting period. Accretion on these investments are recognized on the effective interest method in U.S. dollars and recognized in cash equivalents. All discounts on purchase prices of debt securities are accreted over the life of the respective security.\nResults of Operations\nThe discussion below addresses the material changes in the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. CORN, SOYB, CANE WEAT and TAGS operated for the entirety of all periods discussed below.\nTotal expenses for the current and comparative periods are presented both gross and net of any expenses waived or paid by the Sponsor that would have been incurred by the Funds ( expenses waived by the Sponsor\u201d). For all expenses waived in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the Sponsor has determined that no reimbursement will be sought in future periods. Total expenses, net\u201d, which is after the impact of any expenses waived by or reimbursed to the Sponsor, are presented in the same manner as previously reported. There is, therefore, no impact to or change in the net gain or net loss in any period for the Trust and each Fund as a result of this change in presentation.\nIn accordance with ASU 2016-18 issued by the FASB, the presentation of restricted cash on the financial statements for the period ending December 31, 2017 was updated to be included in Cash and Cash Equivalents\u201d on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities and the Statements of Cash Flows, and as specified in the Notes to the Financial Statements under Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\u201d. This presentation did not have a material impact on the financial statements and disclosures of the Trust and the Funds. Effective October 2017, for all funds the balance for restricted cash held in custody at the Bank of New York Mellon was $0.\nThe Sponsor is responsible for investing the assets of the Fund in accordance with the objectives and policies of the Fund. In addition, the Sponsor arranges for one or more third parties to provide administrative, custodial, accounting, transfer agency and other necessary services to the Fund, including services directly attributable to the Fund such as accounting, financial reporting, regulatory compliance and trading activities, which the Sponsor elected not to outsource. In addition, the Funds, except for TAGS which has no such fee, are contractually obligated to pay a monthly management fee to the Sponsor, based on average daily net assets, at a rate equal to 1.00% per annum.\nThe Fund generally pays for all brokerage fees, taxes and other expenses, including licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, registration or other fees paid to the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA\u201d), or any other regulatory agency in connection with the offer and sale of subsequent Shares after its initial registration and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated therewith. Each Fund also pays its portion of the fees and expenses associated with the Trust's tax accounting and reporting requirements. Certain aggregate expenses common to all Funds within the Trust are allocated by the Sponsor to the respective funds based on activity drivers deemed most appropriate by the Sponsor for such expenses, including but not limited to relative assets under management and creation order activity. These aggregate common expenses include, but are not limited to, legal, auditing, accounting and financial reporting, tax-preparation, regulatory compliance, trading activities, and insurance costs, as well as fees paid to the Distributor, which are included in the related line item in the statements of operations. A portion of these aggregate common expenses are related to services provided by the Sponsor or related parties of principals of the Sponsor; these are necessary services to the Funds, which are primarily the cost of performing accounting and financial reporting, regulatory compliance, and trading activities that are directly attributable to the Funds and are, primarily, included as distribution and marketing fees on the statements of operations. These amounts, for the Trust and for each Fund, are detailed in the notes to the financial statements included in Part II of this filing.\nThe Sponsor has the ability to elect to pay certain expenses on behalf of the Funds or waive the management fee. This election is subject to change by the Sponsor, at its discretion. Expenses paid by the Sponsor and Management fees waived by the Sponsor are, if applicable, presented as waived expenses in the statements of operations for each Fund.\nFor the period January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018, the Funds, in total, recorded an increase in expenses, gross and net of any expenses waived by the Sponsor, over what had been recorded in 2017. For the year ending December 31, 2018, total expenses gross of any waived expenses, were $7,411,981, while total expenses, net were $6,184,551. For the year 2017, these were, $6,580,718 and $5,551,819, respectively. For 2016, these were $6,146,659 and $5,308,644, respectively. The increase in expenses for the period 2018 compared to 2017, gross of any waived expenses, was $831,263 which was driven by increases in all expense categories, specifically: 1) a $146,381 or 10% increase in management fees paid to the Sponsor; 2) a $112,954 or 8% increase in professional fees related to auditing, legal and tax preparation fees; 3) a $475,185 or 18% increase in distribution and marketing fees; 4) a $4,066 or 1% increase in custodian fees and expenses; 5) a $22,100 or 24% increase in business permits and licenses; 6) a $7,584 or 3% increase in general and administrative expenses; 7) a $36,347 or 23% increase in brokerage commissions due to an increase in contracts purchased and rolled; and 8) a $26,646 or 28% increase in other expenses. The 13% increase in expenses year over year was generally due to higher average net assets. Total expenses, net of expenses waived by the Sponsor, increased by $632,732 for 2018 compared to 2017 due to the increase in gross expenses, which was partially offset by an increase of $198,531 in expenses waived by the Sponsor.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, no reimbursement to the Sponsor will be sought in any future period for expenses that have been identified as waived by the Sponsor.\nTeucrium Corn Fund\nThe Teucrium Corn Fund commenced investment operations on June 9, 2010. The investment objective of the Corn Fund is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the Shares' NAV reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average of the closing settlement prices for three futures contracts for corn ( Corn Futures Contracts\u201d) that are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade ( CBOT\u201d), specifically (1) the second-to-expire CBOT Corn Futures Contract, weighted 35%, (2) the third-to-expire CBOT Corn Futures Contract, weighted 30%, and (3) the CBOT Corn Futures Contract expiring in the December following the expiration month of the third-to-expire contract, weighted 35%.

Unrealized gain or loss on trading of commodity futures contracts is a function of the change in the price of contracts held on the final date of the period versus the purchase price for each contract and the number of contracts held in each contract month. The Sponsor has a static benchmark as described above and trades futures contracts to adhere to that benchmark and to adjust for the creation or redemption of shares.\nInterest income for year ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, was $1,480,822, $778,560, and $396,679.

These investments provide a higher rate than money market products offered in the past.
