MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral\nWe are a bank holding company for Plumas Bank, a California state-chartered commercial bank. We derive our income primarily from interest received on real estate related, commercial, automobile and consumer loans and, to a lesser extent, interest on investment securities, fees received in connection with servicing deposit and loan customers and fees from the sale of government guaranteed loans. Our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses. We rely on locally-generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans.\nWe are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results, like those of other financial institutions operating in California, are significantly influenced by economic conditions in California, including the strength of the real estate market. In addition, both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal and state government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact the Bank's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported. Our most complex accounting policies require management's judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. We have established detailed policies and internal control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are applied in an environment that is designed and operating effectively and applied consistently from period to period. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of credit losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date. The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense. Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth. Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance. The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment.\nWe evaluate our allowance for loan losses quarterly. We believe that the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate\u201d because it is based upon management's assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of the loans, including current economic conditions, past credit experience, delinquency status, the value of the underlying collateral, if any, and a continuing review of the portfolio of loans.\nWe cannot provide you with any assurance that economic difficulties or other circumstances which would adversely affect our borrowers and their ability to repay outstanding loans will not occur which would be reflected in increased losses in our loan portfolio, which could result in actual losses that exceed reserves previously established.\nOther Real Estate Owned. Other real estate owned (OREO) represents properties acquired through foreclosure or physical possession. OREO is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired. Write-downs to fair value at the time of transfer to OREO is charged to allowance for loan losses. Subsequent to foreclosure, we periodically evaluate the value of OREO held for sale and record a valuation allowance for any subsequent declines in fair value less selling costs. Subsequent declines in value are charged to operations. Fair value is based on our assessment of information available to us at the end of a reporting period and depends upon a number of factors, including our historical experience, economic conditions, and issues specific to individual properties. Our evaluation of these factors involves subjective estimates and judgments that may change.\nThe following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of significant trends related to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital. It pertains to the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere herein.\nOverview\nThe Company recorded net income of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a 23% increase over net income of $4.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Pretax income increased by $1.7 million, or 22%, from to $9.5 million in 2015 from $7.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNet interest income increased by $2.0 million to $21.4 million during 2015 from $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase in net interest income resulted from an increase in interest income of $1.5 million and a decrease in interest expense of $489 thousand. Interest on loans increased by $1.3 million and interest on investment securities increased by $179 thousand. An increase of $2 thousand in interest expense on deposits was offset by a decrease in interest expense on borrowings of $491 thousand. The largest component of this decrease was a decrease of $537 thousand in interest expense related to the redemption of the Company's $7.5 million subordinated debenture in April, 2015. The provision for loan losses was $1.1 million during 2015 and 2014.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 non-interest income totaled $7.7 million an increase of $400 thousand from the year ended December 31, 2014. The largest component of this increase was an increase in gain on sale of SBA loans of $546 thousand. Gains on sale of securities were $21 thousand during 2015 and $128 thousand in 2014. In addition, the 2014 quarter included a $148 thousand gain on sale of our credit card portfolio.\nNon-interest expense increased by $646 thousand to $18.5 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, up from $17.8 million during 2014. The largest component of this increase was an increase in salary expense of $559 thousand. This increase includes an increase in loan production personnel costs, costs associated with our new Reno, Nevada branch, an increase in commissions earned on the sale of SBA loans, related to an increase in sales volume, and merit and promotional wage increases.\nThe provision for income taxes increased by $631 thousand from $3.1 million in 2014 to $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2015 were $599 million, an increase of $60.4 million from $539 million at December 31, 2014. This increase included increases of $22.6 million in cash and due from banks, $6.4 million in investment securities, $30.0 million in net loans, $0.6 million in premises and equipment, $0.3 million in bank owned life insurance and $2.3 million in other assets exclusive of OREO. OREO decreased by $1.8 million.\nLoans increased by $30.6 million, or 8%, from $370.4 million at December 31, 2014 to $401.0 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in loan balances includes $28.8 million in commercial real estate loans, $5.6 million in commercial loans, $4.5 million in agricultural loans and $3.7 million in automobile loans. These increases were partially offset by declines of $8.4 million in construction and land development loans and $3.6 million in all other loan types. Construction and land development loans, which management has identified as a higher-risk loan category, represented 4.0% and 6.6% of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nTotal deposits increased by $59.4 million from $468 million at December 31, 2014 to $527 million at December 31, 2015. In addition to deposit growth from our branch network, we acquired approximately $10 million in deposits with our acquisition of the Redding, California, branch of Rabobank N.A. effective July 31, 2015. No loans were acquired in this transaction. Core deposit growth remained strong in 2015 as evidenced by increases of $28.4 million in demand deposits, $19.6 million in savings accounts, $9.1 million in interest-bearing transaction accounts (NOW) and $6.4 million in money market accounts. Time deposits declined by $4.1 million, much of which we attribute to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits. The Company has no brokered deposits.\nTotal shareholders' equity increased by $6.0 million from $36.5 million at December 31, 2014 to $42.5 million at December 31, 2015. The $6.0 million includes earnings during the twelve month period totaling $5.8 million with the balance of $0.2 million mostly representing stock option activity.\nThe return on average assets was 1.02% for 2015, up from 0.89% for 2014. The return on average equity was 14.6% for 2015, up from 14.0% for 2014.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nThe following table presents, for the years indicated, the distribution of consolidated average assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity. Average balances are based on average daily balances. It also presents the amounts of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant yields expressed in both dollars and yield percentages, as well as the amounts of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant cost expressed in both dollars and rate percentages. Nonaccrual loans are included in the calculation of average loans while nonaccrued interest thereon is excluded from the computation of yields earned:\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The mix change in net interest income represents the change in average balance multiplied by the change in rate.\n2015 compared to 2014. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense. Net interest income, on a nontax-equivalent basis, was $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, up $2.0 million, or 10.1%, from $19.4 million for 2014. The $2.0 million included an increase of $1.5 million, or 6.9% in interest income, from $21.1 million during 2014 to $22.6 million during the current year and a decrease of $489 thousand in interest expense.\nInterest and fees on loans increased by $1.3 million, interest on investment securities increased by $179 thousand and interest on deposits increased by $37 thousand. The increase in interest and fees on loans was related to an increase in average loan balances partially offset by a decline in yield. Interest on investments securities benefited from both an increase in yield and an increase in average balance.\nInterest and fees on loans was $20.8 million during 2015 and $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The average loan balances were $386.1 million for 2015, up $32.7 million from the $353.4 million for 2014.

We attribute much of the decrease in yield to price competition in our service area. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2014 the Company benefited from a prepayment fee of approximately $0.2 million on a large commercial real estate loan which increased overall loan yield by approximately 5 basis points.\nInterest on investment securities increased by $179 thousand as a result of an increase in yield of 14 basis points from 1.72% during 2014 to 1.86% during 2015 and an increase in average balance from $87.9 million in 2014 to $91.3 million in 2015. The increase in yield on investment securities includes an increase in municipal securities as a percentage of total securities and an increase in market yields. Interest income on other interest-earning assets, which totaled $174 thousand in 2015 and $137 thousand in 2014, primarily relates to interest on cash balances held at the Federal Reserve.\nInterest expense on deposits increased by $2 thousand to $518 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, up from $516 thousand in 2014. Interest expense on time deposits declined by $31 thousand from $212 thousand during 2014 to $181 thousand at during 2015. Average time deposits declined by $4.7 million from $59.1 million during 2014 to $54.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. We attribute much of this decline to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits. The average rate paid on time deposits decreased from 0.36% during 2014 to 0.33% during the current twelve month period. This decrease primarily relates to the maturity of higher rate time deposits.\nInterest expense on NOW accounts increased by $4 thousand. Rates paid on NOW accounts averaged 0.09% during 2015 and 2014. Average balances increased by $4.8 million from 2014 to $88.2 million. Interest expense on money market accounts increased by $1 thousand to $66 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest expense on savings accounts increased by $28 thousand as we continued to experience strong growth in this category of deposits. Average savings deposits increased by $16.4 million from $102.7 million during 2014 to $119.1 million during 2015. The average rate paid on savings accounts during these same periods was 16 basis points.\nInterest expense on other interest-bearing liabilities decreased by $491 thousand from $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $686 thousand during the current twelve month period. On April 15, 2013, to help fund the repurchase of preferred stock during 2013, the Company issued a $7.5 million subordinated debenture. The subordinated debt bears an interest rate of 7.5% per annum, has a term of 8 years with no prepayment allowed during the first two years and was made in conjunction with an eight-year warrant (the Lender Warrant\u201d) to purchase up to 300,000 shares of the Company's common stock, no par value at an exercise price, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, of $5.25 per share. On April 16, 2015 we paid off the subordinated debenture resulting in a reduction in interest expense related to this debt of $537 thousand from $756 thousand during 2014 to $219 thousand during 2015. The effective yield on the debenture during 2015 was 10.2% which was in excess of the 7.5% rate due to amortization of a $75 thousand commitment fee and a discount recorded on issuance of $318 thousand.\nInterest expense on the Company's note payable (see Financial Condition - Note Payable\u201d) increased by $44 thousand to $155 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. This increase was related to an increase in average borrowings on this note from $2.3 million during the 2014 period to $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. During April of 2015 we borrowed an additional $4 million on the note bringing the balance to $5 million. This $4 million along with a dividend from Plumas Bank to Plumas Bancorp were used to fund the payoff of the subordinated debenture. The average rate paid on the note payable was 4.02% during 2015 and 4.83% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest expense on junior subordinated debentures, which increased by $3 thousand to $306 thousand, fluctuates with changes in the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate. Interest on other borrowings, which mostly relates to repurchase agreements, totaled $6 thousand in 2015 and $7 thousand in 2014.\nNet interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. As a result of the changes noted above, the net interest margin for 2015 increased to 4.10%, from 4.05% for 2014.\n2014 compared to 2013. Net interest income, on a nontax-equivalent basis, was $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, up $1.5 million, or 8.5%, from $17.9 million for 2013. An increase of $1.7 million, or 8.7% in interest income, from $19.4 million during 2013 to $21.1 million during the current year, was partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $159 thousand.\nInterest and fees on loans increased by $1.3 million, interest on investment securities increased by $353 thousand and interest on deposits increased by $13 thousand. The increase in interest and fees on loans was related to an increase in average loan balances partially offset by a decline in yield. Interest on investments securities benefited from both an increase in yield and an increase in average balance.\nInterest and fees on loans was $19.5 million during 2014 and $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The average loan balances were $353.4 million for 2014, up $32.2 million from the $321.2 million for 2013.\nThe average yield on loans was 5.52% for 2014 down from 5.66% for 2013. We attribute much of the decrease in yield to price competition in our service area as well as an increase in lower yielding automobile loans as a percentage of total loans.\nInterest on investment securities increased by $353 thousand as a result of an increase in yield of 32 basis points from 1.40% during 2013 to 1.72% during 2014 and an increase in average balance from $82.8 million in 2013 to $87.9 million in 2014. The increase in yield on investment securities incudes an increase in government sponsored agency residential mortgage backed securities and municipal securities as a percentage of total securities and an increase in market yields. Interest income on other interest-earning assets, which totaled $137 thousand in 2014 and $124 thousand in 2013, primarily relates to interest on cash balances held at the Federal Reserve.\nInterest expense on deposits decreased by $84 thousand, or 14%, to $516 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, down from $600 thousand in 2013. Interest expense on time deposits declined by $69 thousand from $281 thousand during 2013 to $212 thousand at during 2014. Average time deposits declined by $6.9 million from $66.0 million during 2013 to $59.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. We attribute much of this decline to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits. The average rate paid on time deposits decreased from 0.43% during 2013 to 0.36% during the current twelve month period. This decrease primarily relates to a decline in market rates paid in the Company's service area and the maturity of higher rate time deposits.\nInterest expense on NOW accounts declined by $14 thousand. Rates paid on NOW accounts declined by 2 basis points from 0.11% during 2013 to 0.09% during 2014. Average balances decreased by $568 thousand from 2013. Interest expense on money market accounts decreased by $17 thousand related to a decrease in rate paid on these accounts of 3 basis points from 0.17% during 2013 to 0.14% during 2014 and a decline in average balances from $48.7 million during 2013 to $46.7 million in 2014. Interest expense on savings accounts increased by $16 thousand as we continued to experience strong growth in this category of deposits. Average savings deposits increased by $18.2 million from $84.5 million during 2013 to $102.7 million during 2014. The average rate paid on savings accounts during this same period declined from 17 basis points during 2013 to 16 basis points during 2014. The decline in rates paid on deposits is consistent with a decline in competitive market rates in our service area.\nInterest expense on other interest-bearing liabilities increased by $243 thousand from $934 thousand during the twelve months ending December 31, 2013 to $1.2 million during 2014. This increase was mostly related to an increase of $215 thousand in interest expense on the $7.5 million subordinated debenture which was only outstanding for 8.5 months during 2013. The effective yield on the debenture during 2014 was 10.3% which was in excess of the 7.5% rate due to amortization of a $75 thousand commitment fee and a discount recorded on issuance of $318 thousand.\nInterest expense on the Company's note payable for 2013 totaled $23 thousand and for 2014 it totaled $111 thousand. The increase relates mostly to an increase in average balance from $567 thousand in 2013 to $2.3 million during 2014.\nInterest expense on junior subordinated debentures, which decreased by $10 thousand from 2013, fluctuates with changes in the 3-month LIBOR rate.\nInterest on other borrowings, which during 2014 relates to repurchase agreements, totaled $7 thousand in 2014 and $57 thousand in 2013.\nNet interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. As a result of the changes noted above, the net interest margin for 2014 increased slightly to 4.05%, from 4.03% for 2013.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 we recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.1 million. See Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for further discussion of loan quality trends and the provision for loan losses.\nThe allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management believes will be appropriate to absorb inherent losses on existing loans based on an evaluation of the collectability of the loans and prior loan loss experience. The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower's ability to repay their loan. The allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. These estimates are reviewed periodically and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known.\nBased on information currently available, management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to absorb potential risks in the portfolio. However, no assurance can be given that the Company may not sustain charge-offs which are in excess of the allowance in any given period.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe following table sets forth the components of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change during Year\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,954 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,912 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(154 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>196 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of loans, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,942 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,396 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan servicing fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>502 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings on bank owned life insurance policies\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(107 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>894 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>176 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,315 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,642 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>673 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 compared to 2014. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 non-interest income totaled $7.7 million an increase of $400 thousand from the year ended December 31, 2014. The largest component of this increase was an increase of $546 thousand in gains on the sale of government guaranteed SBA loans mostly related to an increase in the volume of loans originated and sold. During 2015, proceeds from SBA loan sales totaled $29.4 million resulting in a gain on sale of $1.9 million. This compares to proceeds of $21.6 million and a gain on sale of $1.4 million during 2014. Loan servicing income, which increased by $60 thousand, represents servicing income received on the guaranteed portion of small business administration ( SBA\u201d) loans sold into the secondary market. At December 31, 2015 we were servicing over $86 million in guaranteed portions of loans an increase of $10 million from over $76 million at December 31, 2014. Other non-interest income increased by $54 thousand to $894 thousand mostly related to an increase of $126 thousand in dividends received on Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB) stock. Of the $126 thousand, $88 thousand was a one-time special dividend paid by the FHLB during June 2015. The effect of the increase in FHLB dividends and increases in other items of other non-interest income were partially offset by a $148 thousand gain on the sale of our credit card portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2014. The largest decrease in non-interest income was $154 thousand in service charge income most of which was related to a reduction in NSF and overcharge income which we attribute to improved economic conditions as well as working with our customers to help them reduce NSF activity. Additionally, gain on sale of investments declined by $107 thousand from $128 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 to $21 thousand during 2015.\n2014 compared to 2013. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 non-interest income totaled $7.3 million an increase of $673 thousand from the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. The largest component of this increase was an increase of $196 thousand in service charge income which we attribute to growth in the Company's demand deposit accounts, an increase in debit card interchange income and a restructuring of our service charge fee structure beginning in August of 2013. During July and August 2014 we sold fourteen available-for- sale securities totaling $16.2 million recognizing a gain on sale of $128 thousand. Loan servicing fees, which totaled $502 thousand for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014, increased by $179 thousand from 2013. Other non-interest income increased by $176 thousand mostly related to a $148 thousand gain on the sale of our credit card portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2014. Prior to the sale, credit card loans represented less than one-half of a percent of our loan portfolio.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe following table sets forth the components of other non-interest

Non-interest expense increased by $646 thousand to $18.5 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, up from $17.8 million during 2014. The largest components of this increase were $803 thousand in salary and benefit expense, $124 thousand professional fees, $104 thousand in insurance expense and $127 thousand in other operating expenses. The largest declines in non-interest expense were $180 thousand in OREO expenses, $161 thousand in the provision from change in OREO valuation and $120 thousand in occupancy and equipment expense.\nThe increase in salary and benefits includes an increase in salary expense, exclusive of commissions, of $412 thousand mostly related to merit and promotion increases, new hires including three loan officers; one serving Reno, Nevada, one located in Chico, California and an SBA loan officer in Scottsdale Arizona, and a branch manager for our new Reno, Nevada location. Other significant increases in salary and benefit expense include an increase of $147 thousand in commission expense, $111 thousand in 401k plan contributions and a reduction of $104 thousand in the deferral of loan origination costs. The increase in commission expense is mostly related to an increase in SBA activity. Effective January 1, 2015, we reestablished a 401k matching benefit resulting in $111 thousand in matching contributions. During each of 2015 and 2014 the Company's bonus expense totaled $600 thousand, the maximum payable under the terms of the respective bonus plans.\nThe largest component of the increase in professional fees was an increase of $79 thousand in legal fees related to loan collection activities and general corporate matters including costs associated with our Redding branch acquisition and our future Reno, Nevada branch. The second largest increase in professional fees was an increase of $52 thousand in audit expense related to lending functions, including the cost of our semi-annual loan review, an annual review of our SBA loan operations by the SBA and a review of our loan compliance systems. Insurance expense, during 2014, benefited from a one-time adjustment to accrued life insurance costs.\nThe decline in OREO costs includes a decrease in OREO legal expense of $125 thousand and a decline in repair and maintenance costs of $54 thousand. During 2014 we incurred $142 thousand in legal costs, related to OREO, pursuing additional recoveries on selected OREO properties through legal channels. In addition, OREO repair expense during 2014 totaled $93 thousand much of which was used to fix up several properties in an effort to increase their marketability. OREO repair costs were $62 thousand in 2015. OREO maintenance costs declined by $23 thousand related to a decline in OREO properties.\nOREO represents real property taken by the Bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower. When other real estate is acquired, any excess of the Bank's recorded investment in the loan balance and accrued interest income over the estimated fair market value of the property less costs to sell is charged against the allowance for loan losses. A valuation allowance for losses on other real estate is maintained to provide for temporary declines in value. The allowance is established through a provision for subsequent losses on other real estate which is included in other expenses. Subsequent gains or losses on sales or from impairment are recorded as incurred. The provision from change in OREO valuation declined by $161 thousand from $240 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $79 thousand during the current period. During the first three months of 2015 we recorded a net credit provision of $129 thousand. The credit resulted from a significant increase in value of one OREO property based on a recent appraisal. This property was originally transferred to OREO at a value, net of estimated costs selling costs, of $1 million. Subsequently, based on declines in value it was written down to $0.7 million with a $0.3 million valuation allowance; however, recently the surrounding area in which the property is located has enjoyed significant new business activity and the value of this property has increased resulting in a reduction in the valuation allowance of $0.2 million. The $0.2 million was offset by declines in value on other OREO properties.\nThe decline in occupancy and equipment expense includes several reductions the largest of which was a savings of $49 thousand in equipment expense and maintenance. During 2014 equipment expense was high as we chose to replace all of our personal computers running Windows XP with machines running Windows 7.\n2014 compared to 2013. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, total non-interest expense increased by $275 thousand, or 2%, to $17.8 million, up from $17.6 million for the comparable period in 2013. The largest components of this increase were $745 thousand in salary and benefit expense, $187 thousand in outside service fees and $70 thousand related to reduction in gain on sale of OREO. The largest declines in non-interest expense were $248 thousand in professional fees, $246 thousand in provision for OREO losses, $128 thousand in deposit premium amortization and $121 thousand in insurance expense.\nSalaries and employee benefits increased by $745 thousand primarily related to an increase in bonus expense of $350 thousand. The Bank's bonus plan for 2014 provided for a bonus pool of 60% of the amount that pretax income exceeds budgeted pretax income with a cap of $600 thousand. Bonus expense was $600 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and $250 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. In both years the maximum allowed under the bonus plans was earned. Salary expense, exclusive of commissions, increased by $265 thousand as a decline of four employees from 159 at December 31, 2013 to 155 at December 31, 2014 was offset by an increase in average salary per employee which includes the effect of merit and promotional increases.\nOther increases include, but were not limited to an $89 thousand increase in commissions, which relate to government guaranteed loan production, and a $67 thousand increase in payroll tax expense. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in deferred loan origination costs totaling $104 thousand.\nOf the $187 thousand increase in outside service fees, $96 thousand was related to the outsourcing of our item processing beginning in June of 2013. This cost as been offset by savings in salary and benefit expense and software expense. In addition we incurred an increase in costs for the management of our investment portfolio and an increase in costs related to an increase in debit card interchange transactions.\nProfessional fees benefited from reductions in legal expense related to loan collection activities totaling $148 thousand, a reduction in corporate legal expense of $88 thousand mostly related the repurchase of the preferred stock in 2013 and a reduction in audit expense related to a change in audit firms beginning in 2014.\nThe provision from change in OREO valuation declined by $246 thousand from $486 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 to $240 thousand during the 2014. During the second quarter of 2013 we recorded a $300 thousand provision related to one land development property.\nInsurance expense benefited from a one-time adjustment to accrued life insurance costs. The deposit premium intangible asset was fully amortized at the end of September, 2013 resulting in a savings of $128 thousand during the comparison periods.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The Company recorded an income tax provision of $3.7 million, or 39.0% of pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2015. During 2014 the Company recorded an income tax provision of $3.1 million, or 39.4% of pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2014. The percentages for 2015 and 2014 differ from the statutory rate as tax exempt income such as earnings on Bank owned life insurance and interest on qualified municipal securities.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors. The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is \"more likely than not\" that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. \"More likely than not\" is defined as greater than a 50% chance. All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.\nBased upon the analysis of available evidence, management has determined that it is \"more likely than not\" that all deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded.\nFinancial Condition\nLoan Portfolio. Net loans increased by $30 million, or 8%, from $367 million at December 31, 2014 to $397 million at December 31, 2015. The two largest areas of growth in the Company's loan portfolio were $28.8 million in commercial real estate loans and $5.6 million in commercial loans. Additionally, agricultural loans increased by $4.5 million and automobile loans increased $3.7 million. The largest decrease in any loan category was a decline of $8.4 million in construction and land development loans. The Company continues to manage the mix of its loan portfolio consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financing needs of all sectors of the area it serves. Although the Company offers a broad array of financing options, it continues to concentrate its focus on small to medium sized commercial businesses. These loans offer diversification as to industries and types of businesses, thus limiting material exposure in any industry concentrations. The Company offers both fixed and floating rate loans and obtains collateral in the form of real property, business assets and deposit accounts, but looks to business and personal cash flows as its primary source of repayment.\nAs shown in the following table the Company's largest lending categories are commercial real estate loans, auto loans, equity lines of credit, agricultural loans and commercial loans.\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Balance at End of Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of Loans in Each Category to Total Loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance at End of Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of Loans in Each Category to Total Loans\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/15\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/15\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/14\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/14\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agricultural\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,856 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,284 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>192,095 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>163,306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - construction\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,572 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity Lines of Credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,972 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Auto\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,365 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,818 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Gross Loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>400,971 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>370,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nConstruction and land development loans represented 4.0% and 6.6% of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The construction and land development portfolio component has been identified by Management as a higher-risk loan category. The quality of the construction and land development category is highly dependent on property values both in terms of the likelihood of repayment once the property is transacted by the current owner as well as the level of collateral the Company has securing the loan in the event of default. Loans in this category are characterized by the speculative nature of commercial and residential development properties and can include property in various stages of development from raw land to finished lots. The decline in these loans as a percentage of the Company's loan portfolio from over 21% at December 31, 2007 to less than 7% during the last two years reflects management's efforts, which began in 2009, to reduce its exposure to construction and land development loans.\nThe Company's real estate related loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction and land development loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate comprised 73% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015. Moreover, the business activities of the Company currently are focused in the California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta, Sierra and in Washoe County in Northern Nevada. Consequently, the results of operations and financial condition of the Company are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets. In addition, the concentration of the Company's operations in these areas of Northeastern California and Northwestern Nevada exposes it to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in these regions.\nThe rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments in relation to the Company's lending rate or other indexes such as the published prime interest rate or U.S. Treasury rates and vary with changes in these indexes. The frequency in which variable rate loans reprice can vary from one day to several years. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, approximately 72% and 71%, respectively of the Company's loan portfolio was comprised of variable rate loans. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, 39% and 42%, respectively of the variable loans were at their respective floor rate. While real estate mortgage, commercial and consumer lending remain the foundation of the Company's historical loan mix, some changes in the mix have occurred due to the changing economic environment and the resulting change in demand for certain loan types. The most significant change has been an increase in indirect auto lending with automobile loans increasing from 2.5% of gross loans at December 31, 2011 to 12.1% of gross loans at December 31, 2015. The automobile portfolio provides diversification to the loan portfolio in terms of rate, term and balance as these loans tend to have a much shorter term and balance than commercial real-estate loans and are fixed rate. In addition, the Company remains committed to the agricultural industry in Northeastern California and will continue to pursue high quality agricultural loans. Agricultural loans include both commercial and commercial real estate loans. The Company's agricultural loan balances totaled $40 million at December 31, 2015 and $35 million at December 31, 2014.\nThe following table sets forth the amounts of loans outstanding by category as of the dates indicated.\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> At December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - mortgage\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>217,569 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>192,590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>187,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>174,212 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>158,431 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - construction and land development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,572 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,793 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,801 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,063 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,235 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,274 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,235 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,268 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agriculture (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,856 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,868 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400,971 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>370,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>338,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>315,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>293,865 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Plus:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,940 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>475 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,517 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,908 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>396,833 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>366,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>334,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>310,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>287,432 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes equity lines of credit and auto\n(2) Includes agriculture real estate\nThe following table sets forth the maturity of gross loan categories as of December 31, 2015.

The Company attempts to minimize credit risk through its underwriting and credit review policies. The Company's credit review process includes internally prepared credit reviews as well as contracting with an outside firm to conduct periodic credit reviews. The Company's management and lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as loan conditions change. The Management Asset Resolution Committee (MARC) reviews the asset quality of criticized and past due loans on a monthly basis and reports the findings to the full Board of Directors. In management's opinion, this loan review system helps facilitate the early identification of potential criticized loans.\nThe Company has implemented MARC to develop an action plan to significantly reduce nonperforming assets. It consists of the Bank's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Credit Officer, and the activities are governed by a formal written charter. The MARC meets at least monthly and reports to the Board of Directors.\nMore specifically, a formal plan to effect repayment and/or disposition of every significant nonperforming loan relationship is developed and documented for review and on-going oversight by the MARC. Some of the strategies used include but are not limited to: 1) obtaining additional collateral, 2) obtaining additional investor cash infusion, 3) sale of the promissory note to an outside party, 4) proceeding with foreclosure on the underlying collateral, and 5) legal action against borrower/guarantors to encourage settlement of debt and/or collect any deficiency balance owed. Each step includes a benchmark timeline to track progress.\nMARC also provides guidance for the maintenance and timely disposition of OREO properties; including developing financing and marketing programs to incent individuals to purchase OREO.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of the provision for loan losses. Loan losses are charged to and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management's continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of loans; including current economic conditions, maturity of the portfolio, size of the portfolio, industry concentrations, borrower credit history, collateral, the existing allowance for loan losses, independent credit reviews, current charges and recoveries to the allowance for loan losses and the overall quality of the portfolio as determined by management, regulatory agencies, and independent credit review consultants retained by the Company. There is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio. The collectability of a loan is subjective to some degree, but must relate to the borrower's financial condition, cash flow, quality of the borrower's management expertise, collateral and guarantees, and state of the local economy.\nFormula allocations are calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics. Loss factors are based on the Company's historical loss experience as adjusted for changes in the business cycle and may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management's judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. Historical loss data from the beginning of the latest business cycle are incorporated in the loss factors.\nThe discretionary allocation is based upon management's evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances. The conditions may include, but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the Company, credit quality trends, collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, and other business conditions.\nThe following table provides certain information for the years indicated with respect to the Company's allowance for loan losses as well as charge-off

Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans decreased from 0.33% during 2014 to 0.12% during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses:\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Balance at End of Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of Loans in Each Category to Total Loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance at End of Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of Loans in Each Category to Total Loans\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and agricultural\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>933 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>799 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate mortgage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,080 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate construction\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>874 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer (includes equity LOC & Auto)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe allowance for loan losses totaled $6.1 million at December 31, 2015 and $5.5 million at December 31, 2014. Specific reserves related to impaired loans increased by $187 thousand from $564 thousand at December 31, 2014 to $751 thousand at December 31, 2015. At least quarterly the Company evaluates each specific reserve and if it determines that the loss represented by the specific reserve is uncollectable it records a charge-off for the uncollectable portion. General reserves were $5.3 million at December 31, 2015 and $4.9 million at December 31, 2014. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased from 1.47% at December 31, 2014 to 1.52% at December 31, 2015. The percentage of general reserves to unimpaired loans totaled 1.35% at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nThe Company places loans 90 days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. A loan is considered to be in the process of collection if, based on a probable specific event, it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current. Generally, this collection period would not exceed 90 days. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the Company's general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest. Interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable. Where the collectability of the principal or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management, it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming 90 days delinquent.\nImpaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section. The primary difference between impaired loans and nonperforming loans is that impaired loan recognition considers not only loans 90 days or more past due, restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include identified problem loans other than delinquent loans where it is considered probable that we will not collect all amounts due to us (including both principal and interest) in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement.\nA restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. Restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms. Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above.\nLoans restructured (TDRs) and not included in nonperforming loans in the following table totaled $2.0 million, $2.0 million, $4.5 million, $5.4 million and $8.6 million at December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Specific reserves on nonaccrual loans totaled $683 thousand at December 31, 2015 and $522 thousand at December 31, 2014, respectively. Performing loans past due thirty to eighty-nine days were $1.5 million at December 31, 2015 and $1.6 million at December 31, 2014.\nA substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any. Total substandard loans decreased by $2.1 million from $8.1 million at December 31, 2014 to $6.0 million at December 31, 2015. Loans classified as watch decreased by $0.3 million from $4.4 million at December 31, 2014 to $4.1 million at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, $1.5 million of performing loans were classified as substandard. Further deterioration in the credit quality of individual performing substandard loans or other adverse circumstances could result in the need to place these loans on nonperforming status.\nAt December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company's recorded investment in impaired loans totaled $6.5 million and $8.6 million, respectively. The specific allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans totaled $751 thousand and $564 thousand at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Additionally, $0.7 million has been charged off against the impaired loans at December 31, 2015 and December 31 2014.\nIt is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance for loan losses so that it remains appropriate to absorb the inherent risk of loss in the portfolio. Management believes that the allowance at December 31, 2015 is appropriate. However, the determination of the amount of the allowance is judgmental and subject to economic conditions which cannot be predicted with certainty. Accordingly, the Company cannot predict whether charge-offs of loans in excess of the allowance may occur in future periods.\nOREO represents real property acquired by the Bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower. Repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers. OREO holdings represented seven properties totaling $1.8 million at December 31, 2015 and fifteen properties totaling $3.6 million at December 31, 2014. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 1.06% at December 31, 2015 and 1.90% at December 31, 2014.\nThe following table provides a summary of the change in the number and balance of OREO properties for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, dollars in thousands:\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> #\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> #\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beginning Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,399 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Additions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>729 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dispositions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,083 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,298 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision from change in OREO valuation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(79 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(240 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ending Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,590 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Portfolio and Federal Funds Sold.

The investment portfolio at December 31, 2015 consisted of $74.3 million in securities of U.S. Government-sponsored agencies and 83 municipal securities totaling $22.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2014 the Company sold fourteen available-for-sale investment securities for total proceeds of $16,325,000 recording a $128,000 gain on sale. The investment portfolio at December 31, 2014 consisted of $77.3 million in securities of U.S. Government-sponsored agencies, 52 municipal securities totaling $12.5 million and one corporate security totaling $0.5 million. There were no Federal funds sold at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014; however, the Bank maintained interest earning balances at the Federal Reserve Bank totaling $47.6 million at December 31, 2015 and $22.9 million at December 31, 2014. The balances, at December 31, 2015, earn interest at the rate of 0.5%.\nThe Company classifies its investment securities as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Currently all securities are classified as available-for-sale. Securities classified as available-for-sale may be sold to implement the Company's asset/liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates and similar factors.\nThe following tables summarize the values of the Company's investment securities held on the dates indicated:\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Available-for-sale (fair value)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Government-sponsored agencies\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,977 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,097 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Government-sponsored agency residential mortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,280 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61,875 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Municipal obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,371 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>506 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,704 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90,343 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the maturities of the Company's securities at their carrying value, which represents fair value, and their weighted average tax equivalent yields at December 31, 2015.

Total deposits increased by $59.4 million from $468 million at December 31, 2014 to $527 million at December 31, 2015. In addition to deposit growth from our branch network, we acquired approximately $10 million in deposits with our acquisition of the Redding, California, branch of Rabobank N.A. effective July 31, 2015. Core deposit growth remained strong in 2015 as evidenced by increases in all major deposit categories with the exception of time. The two largest increases were $28.4 million in non-interest bearing demand deposits and $19.6 million in savings accounts. Time deposits declined by $4.1 million, much of which we attribute to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits. The Company continues to manage the mix of its deposits consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financial needs of its customers.\nThe following table shows the distribution of deposits by type at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Balance at End of Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of Deposits in Each Category to Total Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance at End of Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of Deposits in Each Category to Total Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/15\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/15\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/14\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/14\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest bearing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>209,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>180,649 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NOW\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82,144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Money Market\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,499 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Savings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125,896 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>527,276 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>467,891 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeposits represent the Bank's primary source of funds. Deposits are primarily core deposits in that they are demand, savings and time deposits generated from local businesses and individuals. These sources are considered to be relatively stable, long-term relationships thereby enhancing steady growth of the deposit base without major fluctuations in overall deposit balances. The Company experiences, to a small degree, some seasonality with the slower growth period between November through April, and the higher growth period from May through October. In order to assist in meeting any funding demands, the Company maintains a secured borrowing arrangement with the FHLB. There were no brokered deposits at December 31, 2015 or 2014.\nThe Company's time deposits of $100,000 or more had the following schedule of maturities at December 31, 2015:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remaining Maturity:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Three months or less\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,463 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over three months to six months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,685 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over six months to 12 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,056 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over 12 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,341 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,545 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTime deposits of $100,000 or more are generally from the Company's local business and individual customer base. The potential impact on the Company's liquidity from the withdrawal of these deposits is discussed at the Company's asset and liability management committee meetings, and is considered to be minimal.\nShort-term Borrowing Arrangements. The Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $154,000,000 from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $231,000,000. The Company is required to hold FHLB stock as a condition of membership. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company held $2,380,000 of FHLB stock which is recorded as a component of other assets. Based on this level of stock holdings at December 31, 2015, the Company can borrow up to $88,159,000. To borrow the $154,000,000 in available credit the Company would need to purchase $1,787,000 in additional FHLB stock. In addition to its FHLB borrowing line, the Company has unsecured short-term borrowing agreements with three of its correspondent banks in the amounts of $20 million, $11 million and $10 million. There were no outstanding borrowings to the FHLB or the correspondent banks under these agreements at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nNote Payable and Term Loan. On October 24, 2013 the Company issued a $3.0 million promissory note (the Note\u201d) payable to an unrelated commercial bank. As originally issued, the Note provided for an interest rate of U.S. Prime Rate\u201d plus three-quarters percent per annum, 4.00% at December 31, 2014 and 2013, had a term of 18 months and subjected the Bank to several negative and affirmative covenants including, but not limited to providing timely financial information, maintaining specified levels of capital, restrictions on additional borrowings, and meeting or exceeding certain capital and asset quality ratios. The Note is secured by 100 shares of the Bank's stock representing the 100% of the Company's ownership interest in the Bank.\nOn July 28, 2014, the Company and the borrower modified the Note to (1) extend the maturity date to October 24, 2015, (2) increase the maximum principal amount to $7.5 million and (3) permit the Company to borrow, repay and reborrow up to the maximum principal amount of the Note, among other things.\nOn October 1, 2015, the Company and the borrower further modified the Note to (1) extend the maturity date to October 1, 2016, (2) reduce the maximum principal amount to $2.5 million and (3) change the interest rate to U.S. \"Prime Rate\" plus one-half percent per annum.\nConcurrently, with entering into the second modification of the note on October 1, 2015, the Company entered into a $5.0 million term loan (the Term Loan\u201d), which matures on October 1, 2018. The Term Loan requires quarterly principal payments of $125,000 plus accrued interest. Both the Term Loan and the Note bear interest at a rate of the U.S. \"Prime Rate\" plus one-half percent per annum and are secured by 100 shares of Plumas Bank stock representing the Company's 100% ownership interest in Plumas Bank.\nUnder the Term Loan and the Note, the Bank is subject to several negative and affirmative covenants similar to the covenants under the original Note but in several cases less restrictive. The Bank was in compliance with all such covenants related to the Note and the Term Loan at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Interest expense related to the Note and the Term Loan for the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and 2013 totaled $155,000, $111,000 and $23,000, respectively. The ending balance of the Note at December 31, 2014 was $1,000,000. There was no balance outstanding on the Note at December 31, 2015. The balance of the Term Loan was $4,875,000 at December 31, 2015.\nRepurchase Agreements. In 2011 the Bank introduced a new product for its larger business customers which use repurchase agreements as an alternative to interest-bearing deposits. The balance in this product at December 31, 2015 was $7.7 million, a decrease of $1.9 million from the December 31, 2014 balance of $9.6 million. Interest paid on this product is similar to that which is paid on the Bank's premium money market account; however, these are not deposits and are not FDIC insured.\nSubordinated Debentures. On April 15, 2013 the Company issued a $7.5 million subordinated debenture ( subordinated debt\u201d). The subordinated debt was issued to an unrelated third-party ( Lender\u201d) pursuant to a subordinated debenture purchase agreement, subordinated debenture note, and stock purchase warrant. On April 16, 2015 the Company paid off the subordinated debt. Interest expense related to the subordinated debt for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled $219,000, $756,000 and $541,000, respectively.\nThe subordinated debt had an interest rate of 7.5% per annum and a term of 8 years with no prepayment allowed during the first two years and was made in conjunction with an eight-year warrant to purchase up to 300,000 shares of the Bancorp's common stock, no par value at an exercise price, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, of $5.25 per share.\nJunior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures. Plumas Statutory Trust I and II are business trust subsidiaries formed by the Company with capital of $311,000 and $163,000, respectively, for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.\nDuring 2002, Trust I issued 6,000 Floating Rate Capital Trust Pass-Through Securities (\"Trust Preferred Securities\"), with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security, for gross proceeds of $6,000,000. During 2005, Trust II issued 4,000 Trust Preferred Securities with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security, for gross proceeds of $4,000,000. The entire proceeds were invested by Trust I in the amount of $6,186,000 and Trust II in the amount of $4,124,000 in Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (the \"Subordinated Debentures\") issued by the Company, with identical maturity, repricing and payment terms as the Trust Preferred Securities. The Subordinated Debentures represent the sole assets of Trusts I and II.\nTrust I's Subordinated Debentures mature on September 26, 2032, bear a current interest rate of 4.00% (based on 3-month LIBOR plus 3.40%), with repricing and payments due quarterly. Trust II's Subordinated Debentures mature on September 28, 2035, bear a current interest rate of 1.99% (based on 3-month LIBOR plus 1.48%), with repricing and payments due quarterly. The interest rate of the Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust I adjust on each quarterly anniversary date to equal the 3-month LIBOR plus 3.40%. The Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust II adjust on each quarterly anniversary date to equal the 3-month LIBOR plus 1.48%. Both Trusts I and II have the option to defer payment of the distributions for a period of up to five years, as long as the Company is not in default on the payment of interest on the Subordinated Debentures.\nInterest expense recognized by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 related to the subordinated debentures was $306,000, $303,000 and $313,000, respectively.\nCapital Resources\nTotal shareholders' equity increased by $6.0 million from $36.5 million at December 31, 2014 to $42.5 million at December 31, 2015. The $6.0 million includes earnings during the twelve month period totaling $5.8 million with the balance of $0.2 million mostly representing stock option activity.\nIt is the policy of the Company to periodically distribute excess retained earnings to the shareholders through the payment of cash dividends. Such dividends help promote shareholder value and capital adequacy by enhancing the marketability of the Company's stock. All authority to provide a return to the shareholders in the form of a cash or stock dividend or split rests with the Board of Directors. The Board will periodically, but on no regular schedule, review the appropriateness of a cash dividend payment. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies. No common cash dividends were paid during the last seven years.\nThe Company is subject to various restrictions on the payment of dividends.\nCapital Standards.\nThe Company uses a variety of measures to evaluate its capital adequacy. Management reviews these capital measurements on a monthly basis and takes appropriate action to ensure that they are within established internal and external guidelines. The FDIC has promulgated risk-based capital guidelines for all state non-member banks such as the Bank. These guidelines establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures.\nIn July, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital guidelines for U.S. banks. The phase-in period for the final rules began on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rule's requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule. Under the final rules, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company and the Bank. The rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5% and a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The final rules also raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0% and require a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. The final rules also implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments.\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has adopted final amendments to the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (Regulation Y, Appendix C) ( the Policy Statement\u201d) that, among other things, raised from $500 million to $1 billion the asset threshold to qualify for the Policy Statement. Plumas Bancorp qualifies for treatment under the Policy Statement and is no longer subject to consolidated capital rules at the bank holding company level.\nThe following table sets forth the Bank's actual capital amounts and ratios (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

positions of the Bank and the impact of capital plans and long-term strategies are reviewed regularly by management. The Company policy is to maintain the Bank's ratios above the prescribed well-capitalized ratios at all times.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nLoan Commitments. In the normal course of business, there are various commitments outstanding to extend credits that are not reflected in the financial statements. Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Annual review of commercial credit lines, letters of credit and ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances reduces the risk of loss associated with these commitments. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had $83.0 million in unfunded loan commitments and $265 thousand in letters of credit. This compares to $89.7 million in unfunded loan commitments and no letters of credit at December 31, 2014. Of the $83.0 million in unfunded loan commitments, $46.1 million and $36.9 million represented commitments to commercial and consumer customers, respectively. Of the total unfunded commitments at December 31, 2015, $42.6 million were secured by real estate, of which $16.0 million was secured by commercial real estate and $26.6 million was secured by residential real estate in the form of equity lines of credit. The commercial loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent business lines of credit, while the consumer loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent revolving credit card lines and overdraft protection lines. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nOperating Leases. The Company leases two depository branches and three lending offices and two non-branch automated teller machine locations. Total rental expenses under all operating leases were $233,000 and $192,000 during the years ended December, 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The expiration dates of the leases vary, with the first such lease expiring during 2016 and the last such lease expiring during 2020.\nLiquidity\nThe Company manages its liquidity to provide the ability to generate funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals (both anticipated and unanticipated), fund customers' borrowing needs, satisfy maturity of short-term borrowings and maintain reserve requirements. The Company's liquidity needs are managed using assets or liabilities, or both. On the asset side, in addition to cash and due from banks, the Company maintains an investment portfolio which includes unpledged U.S. Government-sponsored agency securities that are classified as available-for-sale. On the liability side, liquidity needs are managed by charging competitive offering rates on deposit products and the use of established lines of credit.\nThe Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $154,000,000 from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $231,000,000. See Short-term Borrowing Arrangements\u201d for additional information on our FHLB borrowing capacity. In addition to its FHLB borrowing line, the Company has unsecured short-term borrowing agreements with three of its correspondent banks in the amounts of $20 million, $11 million and $10 million. There were no outstanding borrowings under the FHLB or the correspondent bank borrowing lines at December 31, 2015 or 2014.\nCustomer deposits are the Company's primary source of funds. Total deposits increased by $59.4 million from $468 million at December 31, 2014 to $527 million at December 31, 2015. Deposits are held in various forms with varying maturities. The Company's securities portfolio, Federal funds sold, FHLB advances, and cash and due from banks serve as the primary sources of liquidity, providing adequate funding for loans during periods of high loan demand. During periods of decreased lending, funds obtained from the maturing or sale of investments, loan payments, and new deposits are invested in short-term earning assets, such as cash held at the FRB, Federal funds sold and investment securities, to serve as a source of funding for future loan growth. Management believes that the Company's available sources of funds, including borrowings, will provide adequate liquidity for its operations in the foreseeable future.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of a bank holding company for Plumas Bank, detailing its sources of income, expenses, and financial condition.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral\nWe are a bank holding company for Plumas Bank, a California state-chartered commercial bank. We derive our income primarily from interest received on real estate related, commercial, automobile and consumer loans and, to a lesser extent, interest on investment securities, fees received in connection with servicing deposit and loan customers and fees from the sale of government guaranteed loans. Our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses. We rely on locally-generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans.\nWe are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results, like those of other financial institutions operating in California, are significantly influenced by economic conditions in California, including the strength of the real estate market. In addition, both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal and state government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact the Bank's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported. Our most complex accounting policies require management's judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. We have established detailed policies and internal control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are applied in an environment that is designed and operating effectively and applied consistently from period to period. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of credit losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date. The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense. Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth. Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance. The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment.\nWe evaluate our allowance for loan losses quarterly. We believe that the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate\u201d because it is based upon management's assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of the loans, including current economic conditions, past credit experience, delinquency status, the value of the underlying collateral, if any, and a continuing review of the portfolio of loans.\nWe cannot provide you with any assurance that economic difficulties or other circumstances which would adversely affect our borrowers and their ability to repay outstanding loans will not occur which would be reflected in increased losses in our loan portfolio, which could result in actual losses that exceed reserves previously established.\nOther Real Estate Owned. Other real estate owned (OREO) represents properties acquired through foreclosure or physical possession. OREO is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired. Write-downs to fair value at the time of transfer to OREO is charged to allowance for loan losses. Subsequent to foreclosure, we periodically evaluate the value of OREO held for sale and record a valuation allowance for any subsequent declines in fair value less selling costs. Subsequent declines in value are charged to operations. Fair value is based on our assessment of information available to us at the end of a reporting period and depends upon a number of factors, including our historical experience, economic conditions, and issues specific to individual properties. Our evaluation of these factors involves subjective estimates and judgments that may change.\nThe following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of significant trends related to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital. It pertains to the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere herein.\nOverview\nThe Company recorded net income of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a 23% increase over net income of $4.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Pretax income increased by $1.7 million, or 22%, from to $9.5 million in 2015 from $7.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNet interest income increased by $2.0 million to $21.4 million during 2015 from $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase in net interest income resulted from an increase in interest income of $1.5 million and a decrease in interest expense of $489 thousand. Interest on loans increased by $1.3 million and interest on investment securities increased by $179 thousand. An increase of $2 thousand in interest expense on deposits was offset by a decrease in interest expense on borrowings of $491 thousand. The largest component of this decrease was a decrease of $537 thousand in interest expense related to the redemption of the Company's $7.5 million subordinated debenture in April, 2015. The provision for loan losses was $1.1 million during 2015 and 2014.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 non-interest income totaled $7.7 million an increase of $400 thousand from the year ended December 31, 2014. The largest component of this increase was an increase in gain on sale of SBA loans of $546 thousand. Gains on sale of securities were $21 thousand during 2015 and $128 thousand in 2014. In addition, the 2014 quarter included a $148 thousand gain on sale of our credit card portfolio.\nNon-interest expense increased by $646 thousand to $18.5 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, up from $17.8 million during 2014. The largest component of this increase was an increase in salary expense of $559 thousand. This increase includes an increase in loan production personnel costs, costs associated with our new Reno, Nevada branch, an increase in commissions earned on the sale of SBA loans, related to an increase in sales volume, and merit and promotional wage increases.\nThe provision for income taxes increased by $631 thousand from $3.1 million in 2014 to $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2015 were $599 million, an increase of $60.4 million from $539 million at December 31, 2014. This increase included increases of $22.6 million in cash and due from banks, $6.4 million in investment securities, $30.0 million in net loans, $0.6 million in premises and equipment, $0.3 million in bank owned life insurance and $2.3 million in other assets exclusive of OREO. OREO decreased by $1.8 million.\nLoans increased by $30.6 million, or 8%, from $370.4 million at December 31, 2014 to $401.0 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in loan balances includes $28.8 million in commercial real estate loans, $5.6 million in commercial loans, $4.5 million in agricultural loans and $3.7 million in automobile loans. These increases were partially offset by declines of $8.4 million in construction and land development loans and $3.6 million in all other loan types. Construction and land development loans, which management has identified as a higher-risk loan category, represented 4.0% and 6.6% of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nTotal deposits increased by $59.4 million from $468 million at December 31, 2014 to $527 million at December 31, 2015. In addition to deposit growth from our branch network, we acquired approximately $10 million in deposits with our acquisition of the Redding, California, branch of Rabobank N.A. effective July 31, 2015. No loans were acquired in this transaction. Core deposit growth remained strong in 2015 as evidenced by increases of $28.4 million in demand deposits, $19.6 million in savings accounts, $9.1 million in interest-bearing transaction accounts (NOW) and $6.4 million in money market accounts. Time deposits declined by $4.1 million, much of which we attribute to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits. The Company has no brokered deposits.\nTotal shareholders' equity increased by $6.0 million from $36.5 million at December 31, 2014 to $42.5 million at December 31, 2015. The $6.0 million includes earnings during the twelve month period totaling $5.8 million with the balance of $0.2 million mostly representing stock option activity.\nThe return on average assets was 1.02% for 2015, up from 0.89% for 2014.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral\nWe are a bank holding company for Plumas Bank, a California state-chartered commercial bank. We derive our income primarily from interest received on real estate related, commercial, automobile and consumer loans and, to a lesser extent, interest on investment securities, fees received in connection with servicing deposit and loan customers and fees from the sale of government guaranteed loans. Our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses. We rely on locally-generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans.\nWe are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results, like those of other financial institutions operating in California, are significantly influenced by economic conditions in California, including the strength of the real estate market. In addition, both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal and state government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact the Bank's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported. Our most complex accounting policies require management's judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. We have established detailed policies and internal control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are applied in an environment that is designed and operating effectively and applied consistently from period to period. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of credit losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date. The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense. Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth. Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance. The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment.\nWe evaluate our allowance for loan losses quarterly. We believe that the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate\u201d because it is based upon management's assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of the loans, including current economic conditions, past credit experience, delinquency status, the value of the underlying collateral, if any, and a continuing review of the portfolio of loans.\nWe cannot provide you with any assurance that economic difficulties or other circumstances which would adversely affect our borrowers and their ability to repay outstanding loans will not occur which would be reflected in increased losses in our loan portfolio, which could result in actual losses that exceed reserves previously established.\nOther Real Estate Owned. Other real estate owned (OREO) represents properties acquired through foreclosure or physical possession. OREO is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired. Write-downs to fair value at the time of transfer to OREO is charged to allowance for loan losses. Subsequent to foreclosure, we periodically evaluate the value of OREO held for sale and record a valuation allowance for any subsequent declines in fair value less selling costs. Subsequent declines in value are charged to operations. Fair value is based on our assessment of information available to us at the end of a reporting period and depends upon a number of factors, including our historical experience, economic conditions, and issues specific to individual properties. Our evaluation of these factors involves subjective estimates and judgments that may change.\nThe following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of significant trends related to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital. It pertains to the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere herein.\nOverview\nThe Company recorded net income of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a 23% increase over net income of $4.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Pretax income increased by $1.7 million, or 22%, from to $9.5 million in 2015 from $7.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNet interest income increased by $2.0 million to $21.4 million during 2015 from $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase in net interest income resulted from an increase in interest income of $1.5 million and a decrease in interest expense of $489 thousand. Interest on loans increased by $1.3 million and interest on investment securities increased by $179 thousand. An increase of $2 thousand in interest expense on deposits was offset by a decrease in interest expense on borrowings of $491 thousand. The largest component of this decrease was a decrease of $537 thousand in interest expense related to the redemption of the Company's $7.5 million subordinated debenture in April, 2015. The provision for loan losses was $1.1 million during 2015 and 2014.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 non-interest income totaled $7.7 million an increase of $400 thousand from the year ended December 31, 2014.

In addition, the 2014 quarter included a $148 thousand gain on sale of our credit card portfolio.\nNon-interest expense increased by $646 thousand to $18.5 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, up from $17.8 million during 2014. The largest component of this increase was an increase in salary expense of $559 thousand. This increase includes an increase in loan production personnel costs, costs associated with our new Reno, Nevada branch, an increase in commissions earned on the sale of SBA loans, related to an increase in sales volume, and merit and promotional wage increases.\nThe provision for income taxes increased by $631 thousand from $3.1 million in 2014 to $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2015 were $599 million, an increase of $60.4 million from $539 million at December 31, 2014.

OREO decreased by $1.8 million.\nLoans increased by $30.6 million, or 8%, from $370.4 million at December 31, 2014 to $401.0 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in loan balances includes $28.8 million in commercial real estate loans, $5.6 million in commercial loans, $4.5 million in agricultural loans and $3.7 million in automobile loans. These increases were partially offset by declines of $8.4 million in construction and land development loans and $3.6 million in all other loan types.

on a tax-equivalent basis. \n (2) Average nonaccrual loan balances of $5.6 million for 2015, $6.7 million for 2014 and $9.3 million for 2013 are included in average loan balances for computational purposes. \n (3) Loan origination fees and costs are included in interest income as adjustments of the loan yields over the life of the loan using the interest method. Loan interest income includes net loan costs of $696,000, $380,000 and $371,000 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \n (4) Net interest spread represents the average yield earned on interest-earning assets less the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. \n (5) Net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest income by total average earning assets. \nThe
