Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based upon current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of certain events may differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" beginning on page 11 and in the section entitled \"Forward-Looking Statements\" on page 3.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a firm that provides integrated engineering, consulting, and construction management services. Our project teams help our commercial and governmental clients implement environmental, energy, infrastructure, and pipeline projects from initial concept to delivery and operation. We provide our services almost entirely in the United States of America.\nWe generate revenue and cash flows from fees for professional and technical services. As a service company, we are more labor-intensive than capital-intensive. Our revenue and cash flow is driven by our ability to attract and retain qualified and productive employees, identify business opportunities, secure new and renew existing client contracts, provide outstanding service to our clients and execute projects successfully. Our income from operations is derived from our ability to generate revenue under our contracts in excess of our direct costs, subcontractor costs, other contract costs, and general and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses.\nIn the course of providing our services, we routinely subcontract services. Generally, these subcontractor costs are passed through to our clients and, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") and consistent with industry practice, are included in gross revenue. Because subcontractor services can change significantly from project to project, changes in gross revenue may not be indicative of business trends. Accordingly, we also report net service revenue (\"NSR\"), which is gross revenue less subcontractor costs and other direct reimbursable charges, and our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations uses NSR as a primary point of reference.\nThe following table presents the approximate percentage of NSR by contract type:\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time-and-materials\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed-price\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost-plus\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur cost of services (\"COS\") includes professional compensation and related benefits together with certain direct and indirect costs such as rents, utilities and travel. Professional compensation represents the majority of these costs. Our G&A expenses are comprised primarily of our corporate headquarters costs related to corporate executive management, finance, accounting, information technology, administration and legal. These costs are generally unrelated to specific client projects and can vary as expenses are incurred to support corporate activities and initiatives.\nOur revenue, expenses and operating results may fluctuate significantly from year to year as a result of numerous factors, including:\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Unanticipated changes in contract performance that may affect profitability, particularly with contracts that are fixed-price or have funding limits;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Seasonality of the spending cycle, notably for state and local government entities, and the spending patterns of our commercial sector clients;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Budget constraints experienced by our federal, state and local government clients;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Divestitures or discontinuance of operating units;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The timing and impact of acquisitions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Employee hiring, utilization and turnover rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The number and significance of client contracts commenced and completed during the period;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Creditworthiness and solvency of clients;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The ability of our clients to terminate contracts without penalties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Delays incurred in connection with contracts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The size, scope and payment terms of contracts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Contract negotiations on change orders and collection of related accounts receivable;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The timing of expenses incurred for corporate initiatives;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Competition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Litigation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in accounting rules;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The credit markets and their effect on our customers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>General economic or political conditions; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Employee expenses such as medical and other benefits.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisitions. We continuously evaluate the marketplace for strategic acquisition opportunities. A fundamental component of our profitable growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions that will expand our platform in key U.S. markets. Where the impact of acquisitions is noted in discussing results, it refers to acquisitions effected within the last twelve months of the end of the relevant period.\nFiscal Year 2016 Acquisition\nOn November 30, 2015, we acquired the Professional Services business (\"Pipeline Services\") of Willbros Group (\"Willbros\") in an all cash transaction. The $124.5 million purchase price consisted of (i) an initial cash payment of $120.0 million paid at closing, and, (ii) a second cash payment due of $7.5 million payable at the earlier of certain Willbros contract novations (or written approval of a subcontract) and Willbros obtaining certain consents, or March 15, 2016, net of a preliminary estimate working capital adjustment due from Willbros. The second cash payment was made in two tranches, with $2.4 million paid in March 2016 and the remaining balance paid in July 2016 in conjunction with the final net working capital settlement. Goodwill of $60.3 million was initially recorded prior to impairment, all of which is expected to be tax deductible, and other intangible assets of $44.5 million were recorded as a result of this acquisition. The goodwill recognized is attributable to the future strategic growth opportunities arising from the acquisition, Pipeline Service's highly skilled assembled workforce, which does not qualify for separate recognition, and the expected cost synergies of the combined operations. The Pipeline Services operating segment has contributed $60.7 million in gross revenue, $48.4 million in net service revenue, and an operating loss of $(7.5) million to our results for the period from November 30, 2015 through June 30, 2016.\nFiscal Year 2015 Acquisition\nOn September 29, 2014, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of NOVA Training Inc. and all of the outstanding membership interests of NOVA Earthworks, LLC (collectively \"NOVA\") based in Midland, Texas. NOVA provides safety training and environmental services as well as oil spill response, remediation and general oil field construction services to customers in the oil and gas industry. The initial purchase price consisted of (i) a cash payment of $7.2 million payable at closing, (ii) a second cash payment of $2.6 million placed into escrow, of which $0.5 million was paid in six months and the remaining $2.1 million was paid in 18 months, (iii) 50 thousand shares of our common stock valued at $0.3 million on the closing date, and (iv) a $0.6 million net working capital adjustment. The sellers are also entitled to up to $1.5 million in contingent cash consideration through an earn-out provision based on the NSR performance of the acquired firm over the 24 month period following closing. We estimated the fair value of the remaining contingent earn-out liability to be $0.3 million based on the projections and probabilities of reaching the performance goals through September 2016. Goodwill of $3.7 million, none of which is expected to be tax deductible, and other intangible assets of $3.6 million were recorded as a result of this acquisition. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the synergies and ancillary growth opportunities expected to arise after the acquisition. The fair values of assets and liabilities of the NOVA acquisition have been recorded in the Environmental operating segment. The impact of this acquisition was not material to our condensed consolidated balance sheets and results of operations.\nFiscal Year 2014 Acquisitions\nOn January 2, 2014, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of EMCOR Energy Services, Inc. (\"EES\"), a subsidiary of EMCOR Group, Inc., headquartered in San Francisco, California. EES provides engineering and related consulting services to utilities to support their energy programs in California. Services include engineering, technical review, verification, and administration of utilities' energy efficiency programs. The purchase price of $1.6 million consisted of a cash payment of $1.4 million, and a $0.2 million net working capital adjustment. Goodwill of $0.2 million, none of which is expected to be tax deductible, and other intangible assets of $0.9 million were recorded as a result of this acquisition. The EES acquisition has been recorded in the Energy operating segment. The impact of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated balance sheets and results of operations.\nOn July 22, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Utility Support Systems, Inc. (\"USS\"), headquartered in Douglasville, Georgia. USS provides engineering and related services primarily supporting the power/utility market. The purchase price of $5.0 million consisted of: (i) cash of $2.5 million payable at closing, (ii) a second cash payment of $1.8 million payable on the one-year anniversary of the closing date subject to withholding for various contractual issues, and (iii) 34 thousand shares of our common stock valued at $0.3 million on the closing date. The selling shareholders were also entitled to contingent cash consideration through an earn-out provision based on NSR performance of the acquired firm over the twelve month period following closing. We estimated the fair value of the contingent earn-out liability to be $0.5 million based on the projections and probabilities of reaching the performance goals through July 2014. The earnout goals were not achieved, and the liability was subsequently reversed in fiscal year 2014. Goodwill of $2.2 million, none of which is expected to be tax deductible, and other intangible assets of $2.1 million were recorded as a result of this acquisition. The USS acquisition has been recorded in the Energy operating segment. The impact of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated balance sheets and results of operations.\nOperating Segments\nWe manage our business under the following four operating segments:\nEnergy: The Energy operating segment provides services to a range of clients including energy companies, power utilities, other commercial entities, and state and federal government entities. Our services include program management, engineer/procure/construct projects, design, and consulting. Our typical projects involve upgrades, design and new construction for electric transmission and distribution systems and substations; energy efficiency program design and management; and renewable energy development and power generation.\nEnvironmental: The Environmental operating segment provides services to a wide range of clients including industrial, transportation, energy and natural resource companies, as well as federal, state and municipal agencies. The Environmental operating segment is organized to focus on key areas of demand including: environmental management of buildings and facilities; air quality measurements and modeling of potential air pollution impacts; water quality and water resource management; assessment and remediation of contaminated sites and buildings; hazardous waste management; construction monitoring, inspection and management; environmental, health and safety management and sustainability advisory services; compliance auditing and strategic due diligence; environmental licensing and permitting of a wide variety of projects; and natural and cultural resource assessment, protection and management.\nInfrastructure: The Infrastructure operating segment provides services related to the expansion of infrastructure capacity, and the rehabilitation of overburdened and deteriorating infrastructure systems. Our client base is predominantly state and municipal governments as well as select commercial developers. In addition, we provide infrastructure services on projects originating in our Energy and Environmental operating segments. Primary services include: roadway, bridge and related surface transportation design; structural design and inspection of bridges; program management; construction engineering inspection and construction management for roads and bridges; civil engineering for municipalities and public works departments; geotechnical engineering services; and security assessments, design and construction management.\nPipeline Services: The Pipeline Services operating segment provides pipeline and facilities engineering, EPC/EPCM, field services and integrity services to the oil and gas transmission and midstream markets, as well as at government facilities. We specialize in providing engineering services to assist clients in designing, engineering and constructing or expanding pipeline systems, compressor stations, pump stations, fuel storage facilities, terminals, and field gathering and production facilities. Our expertise extends to the engineering of a wide range of project peripherals, including various types of support buildings and utility systems, power generation and electrical transmission systems, communications systems, fire protection, water and sewage treatment, water transmission, roads and railroad sidings. We also provide project management, engineering and material procurement services to the refining industry and government agencies, including mechanical, civil, structural, electrical instrumentation/controls and environmental engineering. We provide\nfull-service integrity management program offerings including program development, data services, risk analysis, corrosion evaluation, integrity engineering and integrity construction services. We are partnered with Google to provide a cloud-based pipeline life-cycle integrity management solution, Integra Link\u2122, which utilizes Google's geospatial technology platform to help oil and gas pipeline companies visualize and utilize their data and information.\nOur chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"). Our CEO manages the business by evaluating the financial results of the four operating segments, focusing primarily on segment revenue and segment profit. We utilize segment revenue and segment profit because we believe they provide useful information for effectively allocating resources among operating segments; evaluating the health of our operating segments based on metrics that management can actively influence; and gauging our investments and our ability to service, incur or pay down debt. Specifically, our CEO evaluates segment revenue and segment profit and assesses the performance of each operating segment based on these measures, as well as, among other things, the prospects of each of the operating segments and how they fit into our overall strategy. Our CEO then decides how resources should be allocated among our operating segments. We do not track our assets by operating segment, and consequently, it is not practical to show assets by operating segment. Segment profit includes all operating expenses except the following: costs associated with providing corporate shared services (including certain depreciation and amortization), goodwill and intangible asset write-offs, stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation expense is primarily allocated to operating segments based upon their respective use of total operating segment office space. Assets solely used by Corporate are not allocated to the operating segments. Inter-segment balances and transactions are not material. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those for us as a whole except as discussed herein.\nThe following table presents the approximate percentage of our NSR by operating segment:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Infrastructure\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pipeline\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBusiness Trend Analysis\nEnergy: The utilities in the United States are in the midst of a multi-year upgrade of the electric transmission grid to improve capacity, reliability and distribution of sources of generation. Years of underinvestment coupled with a favorable regulatory environment have provided a good business opportunity for those serving this market. According to the Edison Electric Institute, electric utilities throughout the United States will be investing over $60 billion in the performance of this work over the next several years. Economic impacts have slowed the pace of this investment, yet they do not appear to have affected the long term plan of investment. Demand for energy efficiency services continues to be supported by increasing state and federal funds targeted at energy efficiency. The Regional Green House Gas Initiative and system benefit charges at the state or utility level have expanded the marketplace for energy efficiency program management services. Investment within the renewable portfolios also remains strong. We are well established in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions and are growing our presence in the Southeast and in Texas and California where demand for services is the highest.\nEnvironmental: Although there had been signs of growth in this market following a slowdown caused by general economic conditions, market demand for environmental services continues to be mixed. The last decade saw growth in nearly all aspects of this market. The fundamental market drivers remain in place, and this market also benefits from evolving regulatory developments particularly with respect to air quality, and the continuing need to enhance our aging transportation and energy infrastructure. While we expect oil and gas activity and major capital projects to be constrained in the near term, the outlook for services related to other areas of the market, such as environmental remediation, construction, transaction support, the retirement of coal plants and the need to transport natural gas remains favorable. Renewables and other energy source initiatives present important market opportunities but are linked to federal and state policy changes which will be required for the markets to commit long-term capital to projects such as pipelines and related infrastructure.\nInfrastructure: Long-term prospects should be favorable and our backlog is up significantly. The overall infrastructure construction markets are expected to benefit from the federal funding certainty provided by the new $305 billion highway bill known as the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act. The bill calls for the spending of approximately $205 billion on highways and $48 billion on transit projects.\nPipeline Services: Our Pipeline Services segment is currently in the midst of a market downturn due to low oil and gas prices and uncertainty in the oil and gas markets. Nevertheless, long-term opportunities include mid-stream oil and natural gas liquid pipelines which are necessary to match takeaway capacity with levels of production, some of which is stranded due to inadequate pipeline infrastructure, primarily in the Marcellus and Utica shales. Additional future opportunities are presented by natural gas pipelines to take gas to LNG export facilities as well as Mexico and Latin America. Furthermore natural gas pipelines will be required as coal plants are retired and replaced with cleaner gas-burning plants. New regulatory requirements proposed by the Department of Transportation will lead to data and integrity requirements for pipeline operators where our technologies and services can be utilized.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions. We use our best judgment in the assumptions used to compile these estimates, which are based on current facts and circumstances, prior experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are the policies which are most critical in the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations:\nRevenue Recognition-We recognize contract revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Specifically, we follow the guidance in ASC Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts.\nFixed-Price Contracts\nWe recognize revenue on fixed-price contracts using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method of revenue recognition, we estimate the progress towards completion to determine the amount of revenue and profit to recognize on all significant contracts. We generally utilize an efforts-expended, cost-to-cost approach in applying the percentage-of-completion method under which revenue is earned in proportion to total costs incurred divided by total costs expected to be incurred.\nUnder the percentage-of-completion method, recognition of profit is dependent upon the accuracy of a variety of estimates including engineering progress, materials quantities, achievement of milestones and other incentives, liquidated-damages provisions, labor productivity and cost estimates. Such estimates are based on various judgments we make with respect to those factors and can be difficult to accurately determine until the project is significantly underway. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, actual completion costs often vary from estimates. If estimated total costs on any contract indicate a loss, we charge the entire estimated loss to operations in the period the loss first becomes known. If actual costs exceed the original fixed contract price, recognition of any additional revenue will be pursuant to a change order, contract modification, or claim.\nWe have entered into fixed-price Exit Strategy contracts to remediate environmental conditions at contaminated sites. Under most Exit Strategy contracts, the majority of the contract price was deposited by the client into a restricted account with an insurer. The funds in the restricted account are held by the insurer and used to pay us as work is performed. The arrangement with the insurer provides for the deposited funds to earn interest at the one-year constant maturity United States Treasury Bill rate. The interest is recorded when earned and reported as interest income from contractual arrangements on the consolidated statements of operations. On certain Exit Strategy projects, we have taken title to the underlying properties in order to facilitate access, remedial construction, performance of operations monitoring and maintenance activities, and the overall execution of the cleanup. As these properties are distressed, they have no value.\nThe Exit Strategy funds held by the insurer, including any interest thereon, are recorded as an asset (current and long-term restricted investment) on our consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding liability (current and long-term deferred revenue) related to the funds. Consistent with our other fixed-price contracts, we recognize revenue on Exit Strategy contracts using the percentage-of-completion method. When determining the extent of progress towards completion on Exit Strategy contracts, prepaid insurance premiums and fees are amortized, on a straight-line basis, to cost incurred over the life of the related insurance policy. Certain Exit Strategy contracts were classified as pertaining to either remediation or operation, maintenance and monitoring. In addition, certain Exit Strategy contracts were segmented such that the remediation and operation portion of the contract is separately accounted for from the maintenance and monitoring portion.\nUnder most Exit Strategy contracts, additional payments were made by the client to the insurer, typically through an insurance broker, for insurance premiums and fees for a policy to cover potential costs in excess of the original estimates and other factors\nsuch as third party liability. For Exit Strategy contracts where we establish that (1) costs exceed the contract value and interest growth thereon and (2) such costs are covered by insurance, we record an estimated insurance recovery up to the amount of insured costs. An insurance gain, that is, an amount to be recovered in excess of our recorded costs, is not recognized until the receipt of insurance proceeds. Insurance recoveries are reported as insurance recoverables and other income on our consolidated statements of operations. If estimated total costs on any contract indicate a loss, we charge the entire estimated loss to operations in the period the loss first becomes known.\nUnit price contracts are a subset of fixed-price contracts. Under unit price contracts, our clients pay a set fee for each unit of service or production. We recognize revenue under unit price contracts as we complete the related service transaction for our clients. If our costs per service transaction exceed original estimates, our profit margins will decrease, and we may realize a loss on the project unless we can receive payment for the additional costs.\nTime-and-Materials Contracts\nUnder time-and-materials contracts, we negotiate hourly billing rates and charge our clients based on the actual time that we expend on a project. In addition, clients reimburse us for actual out-of-pocket costs of materials and other direct reimbursable expenses that we incur in connection with our performance under the contract. Our profit margins on time-and-materials contracts fluctuate based on actual labor and overhead costs that we directly charge or allocate to contracts compared to negotiated billing rates. Revenue on time-and-materials contracts is recognized based on the actual number of hours we spend on the projects plus any actual out-of-pocket costs of materials and other direct reimbursable expenses that we incur on the projects.\nCost-Plus Contracts\nCost-Plus Fixed Fee Contracts. Under our cost-plus fixed fee contracts, we charge clients for our costs, including both direct and indirect costs, plus a fixed negotiated fee. In negotiating a cost-plus fixed fee contract, we estimate all recoverable direct and indirect costs and then add a fixed profit component. The total estimated cost plus the negotiated fee represents the total contract value. We recognize revenue based on the actual labor and non-labor costs we incur plus the portion of the fixed fee we have earned to date.\nCost-Plus Fixed Rate Contracts. Under our cost-plus fixed rate contracts, we charge clients for our costs plus negotiated rates based on our indirect costs. In negotiating a cost-plus fixed rate contract, we estimate all recoverable direct and indirect costs and then add a profit component, which is a percentage of total recoverable costs, to arrive at a total dollar estimate for the project. We recognize revenue based on the actual total costs we have expended plus the applicable fixed rate. If the actual total costs are lower than the total costs we have estimated, our revenue from that project will be lower than originally estimated.\nChange Orders/Claims\nChange orders are modifications to an original contract that change the provisions of the contract. Change orders typically result from changes in scope, specifications or design, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites, or period of completion of the work. Claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price that we seek to collect from our clients or others for delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders that are either in dispute or are unapproved as to both scope and price, or other causes.\nCosts related to change orders and claims are recognized when they are incurred. Change orders are included in total estimated contract revenue when it is probable that the change order will result in a bona fide addition to contract value and can be reliably estimated. Claims are included in total estimated contract revenues only to the extent that contract costs related to the claims have been incurred and when it is probable that the claim will result in a bona fide addition to contract value which can be reliably estimated. No profit is recognized on claims until final settlement occurs. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we did not recognize any revenue related to claims.\nOther Contract Matters\nFederal Acquisition Regulations (\"FAR\"), which are applicable to our federal government contracts and may be incorporated in many local and state agency contracts, limit the recovery of certain specified indirect costs on contracts. Cost-plus contracts covered by FAR or with certain state and local agencies also require an audit of actual costs and provide for upward or downward adjustments if actual recoverable costs differ from billed recoverable costs. Most of our federal government contracts are subject to termination at the discretion of the client. Contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of such termination.\nContracts with the federal government are subject to audit, primarily by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (\"DCAA\"), which reviews our overhead rates, operating systems and cost proposals. During the course of its audits, the DCAA may disallow costs if it determines that we have accounted for such costs in a manner inconsistent with Cost Accounting Standards or FAR. Our last incurred cost audit was for fiscal year 2004 and resulted in an immaterial adjustment. DCAA determined that an audit of incurred\ncost proposals submitted to DCAA for fiscal years 2005 through 2013 was not required. Historically, we have not had any material cost disallowances by the DCAA as a result of audit, however there can be no assurance that DCAA audits will not result in material cost disallowances in the future.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts-An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our clients to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts has been determined through reviews of specific amounts deemed to be uncollectible and estimated write-offs as a result of clients who have filed for bankruptcy protection plus an allowance for other amounts for which some loss is determined to be probable based on current circumstances. If the financial condition of clients or our assessment as to collectability were to change, adjustments to the allowances may be required.\nIncome Taxes-We are required to estimate the provision for income taxes, including the current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of assets and liabilities for tax and financial accounting purposes. These differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, together with net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards and tax credits are recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. An assessment is required to be made of the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent that we determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred asset will not be utilized, a valuation allowance is established. Taxable income in future periods significantly above or below that projected will cause adjustments to the valuation allowance that could materially decrease or increase future income tax expense.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements.\nAcquisitions-We account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. The purchase price of acquisitions is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values, and any excess purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill typically represents the value paid for the assembled workforce and enhancement of our service offerings. We may use independent valuation specialists to assist in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which could require certain significant management assumptions and estimates. Transaction costs associated with acquisitions are expensed as they are incurred.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets-In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We perform impairment tests for our reporting units with recorded goodwill utilizing valuation methods, including the discounted cash flow method, the guideline company approach, and the guideline transaction approach, as the best evidence of fair value. The valuation methodology used to estimate the fair value of the total Company and our reporting units requires inputs and assumptions (i.e. revenue growth, operating profit margins and discount rates) that reflect current market conditions. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired, and we then determine the implied fair value of goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of goodwill to determine if impairment exists.\nWe performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of April 29, 2016, and determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded its carrying value, and therefore no further analysis was required. As of June 30, 2016, we had $75.3 million of goodwill. We do not believe there were any events or changes in circumstances since our April 2016 annual assessment that would indicate the fair value of goodwill was more likely than not reduced to below its carrying value. In making this assessment we relied on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and market data.\nOther intangible assets are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and consist primarily of purchased customer relationships and other intangible assets acquired in acquisitions. The costs of intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized on a basis approximating the economic value derived from those assets. We review the economic lives of our intangible assets annually.\nManagement judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests for all reporting units with goodwill and in measuring the fair value of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets. While we believe our judgments and assumptions are reasonable, different assumptions could change the estimated fair values or the amount of recognized impairment losses. An adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill and/or identifiable intangible assets could materially impact our consolidated results of operations\nInsurance Matters, Litigation and Contingencies-In the normal course of business, we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation. Generally, such guarantees relate to project schedules and performance. Most of the litigation involves us as a defendant in contractual disputes, professional liability, personal injury and other similar lawsuits. We maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations, however we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of substantial deductibles, exclusions and retentions under our insurance programs. This may subject us to future liability for which we are only partially insured or are completely uninsured. In accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies, we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated losses from claims and settlements when such losses are deemed probable and estimable. Otherwise, these losses are expensed as incurred. Costs of defense are expensed as incurred. We undertake an overall assessment of risk, and if the estimate of a probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a more reasonable estimate, we accrue the lower limit of the range. As additional information about current or future litigation or other contingencies becomes available, management will assess whether such information warrants the recording of changes in the expenses relating to those contingencies. Additional expenses could potentially have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year

Organic activities accounted for $9.2 million, or 12.3%, of the increase, and acquisitions accounted for $65.5 million, or 87.7%, of the growth in gross revenue. The growth in organic gross revenue was driven by our Infrastructure operating segment where organic gross revenue increased $13.2 million primarily driven by increased transportation-related spending by our state and commercial clients. In addition, organic gross revenue increased $12.1 million in our Energy operating segment due to increased demand for electric transmission and distribution services. This organic growth was offset, in part, by a $16.4 million decline in the Environmental operating segment organic gross revenue where we experienced decreased demand from our oil and gas clients for services primarily related to midstream activities.\nNSR increased $57.1 million, or 14.0%, to $465.1 million for fiscal year 2016 from $408.0 million for fiscal year 2015. Organic activities accounted for $4.9 million, or 8.5%, of the growth in NSR, and acquisitions accounted for the remaining $52.2 million, or 91.5%, of the increase. The increase in organic NSR was primarily attributable to our Infrastructure and Energy operating segments where organic NSR increased $8.1 million and $3.3 million respectively. These organic NSR increases are due to the same factors that led to the increases in gross revenue. This organic growth was offset, in part, by a $5.8 million decline in the Environmental operating segment organic NSR that was due to the same factors that led to the decrease in organic gross revenue.\nInsurance recoverables and other income increased $9.5 million, or 145.6%, to $16.0 million for fiscal year 2016 from $6.5 million for fiscal year 2015. During fiscal year 2016, certain Exit Strategy projects had estimated cost increases which are not expected to be funded by the project-specific restricted investments and, therefore, are projected to be funded by the project-specific insurance policy procured at project inception to cover, among other things, costs in excess of the original estimates. In particular, we increased insurance recoverables by $13.1 million in the fourth quarter on one project to account for the projected recoveries of the increased cost estimates. We did not experience the same level of estimated cost increases in the prior year.\nCOS increased $65.0 million, or 19.3%, to $402.3 million for fiscal year 2016 from $337.3 million for fiscal year 2015. Organic activities accounted for $15.1 million, or 23.3%, of the increase in COS, and acquisitions accounted for the remaining $49.9 million, or 76.7%, of the increase. Organic COS increased $5.2 million and $1.9 million in our Infrastructure and Energy operating segments, respectively. These increases were primarily attributable to costs incurred to support the current demand from our Infrastructure and Energy operating segment clients. Organic COS increased $6.5 million in our Environmental operating segment primarily due to the aforementioned estimated cost increases on the Exit Strategy contract which increased COS by $9.6 million in fiscal 2016. We did not experience the same level of estimated cost increases in the prior period. The increases on the Exit Strategy contract were partially offset within our Environmental operating segment by decreases due to the aforementioned lower volumes of work in the current year. As a percentage of NSR, COS was 86.4% and 82.7% for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. This increase in COS as a percentage of NSR was largely attributable to the current year cost increases on the noted Exit Strategy project as well as lower utilization within our Environmental operating segment.\nG&A expenses decreased $3.0 million, or 7.9%, to $34.4 million for fiscal year 2016 from $37.3 million for fiscal year 2015. The decrease was largely attributable to lower litigation related costs in the current year. As a percentage of NSR, G&A expenses were 7.4% and 9.1% for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAcquisition and integration expenses for fiscal year 2016 are comprised of:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance and personnel costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease abandonment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill impairment was $22.0 million for fiscal year 2016. Due to the current economic conditions in the oil and gas markets and actual operating performance, we assessed the recoverability of goodwill within our Pipeline Services operating segment during the three months ended March 25, 2016. In performing the goodwill assessment, we performed an impairment analysis that involved the use of discounted cash flow models as the best evidence of fair value. The aggregate fair value of our Pipeline Services operating segment declined from its initial November 2015 valuation primarily due to a reduction in the projected future cash flows. This reduction was primarily driven by a challenging commodity price environment and continued market uncertainty, which has had an adverse impact on capital spending. While the fundamentals for midstream infrastructure investment remain positive in the long term, the near term outlook remains uncertain, causing delays of large, midstream infrastructure projects. We do not expect activity to meaningfully increase in the near-term and, therefore, have adjusted our cash flows and sized our Pipeline Services operating segment accordingly. Because of this reduction in our near term cash flow estimates, the fair value of the two Pipeline Services reporting units with goodwill did not exceed their carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $22.0 million during fiscal year 2016. Further, the measurement period for purchase price allocation related to the Pipeline Services acquisition remains open, as the initial purchase price allocation remains preliminary. Any future adjustments to the purchase price allocation could materially impact the final charge for goodwill impairment.\nSignificant assumptions underlying the discounted cash flows included: a weighted average cost of capital; profit margins and a terminal growth rate. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the valuation model. As an example, a hypothetical 1% change in weighted average cost of capital would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately $10.0 million. A hypothetical 1% change in the profit margin percentages in all periods would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately $5.0 million. Finally, a hypothetical 1% change in the terminal growth rate would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately $6.0 million. Changes in fair value from changes in these assumptions would increase/decrease the goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, if we experience sustained periods of constrained capital spending beyond the periods already contemplated in our model, it could adversely impact our valuation. These assumptions are highly judgmental and subject to change. Such changes, if material, may require us to incur additional impairment charges for goodwill and/or other indefinite-lived intangible assets in future periods.\nDepreciation expense increased $1.1 million, or 18.5%, to $6.9 million for fiscal year 2016 from $5.8 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in depreciation expense is primarily the result of additional depreciation being incurred on assets acquired in connection with businesses acquired.\nAmortization expense increased $4.3 million, or 123.7%, to $7.8 million for fiscal year 2016 from $3.5 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in amortization expense is primarily the result of additional amortization being incurred on intangible assets acquired in connection with businesses acquired.\nThe federal, state and foreign income tax benefit was $0.7 million for fiscal year 2016 compared to an income tax provision of $11.2 million for the same period in the prior fiscal year. The net federal, state and foreign income tax benefit of $0.7 million for fiscal year 2016 was comprised of a current provision of $6.5 million and a deferred benefit of $7.2 million. The net federal, state and foreign income tax provision of $11.2 million for fiscal year 2015 was comprised of a current provision of $14.8 million and a deferred benefit of $3.6 million. Our effective tax rate was approximately 106.5% for fiscal year 2016, compared to approximately 36.5% for fiscal year 2015. Our effective tax rate excluding the Goodwill impairment was approximately 36.7% for the fiscal year 2016. The primary reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35.0% and our overall effective tax rate were the effect of state income taxes offset by discrete tax benefits related to the U.S. Research and Development credit and U.S. Domestic Production Activities deduction in the current period, and the effect of state income taxes offset by discrete tax benefits related to research and development tax credits for the prior year period.\nOperating Segment Results of Operations\nEnergy Operating Segment Results\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net service revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>145,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross revenue increased $14.0 million, or 8.3%, to $182.6 million for fiscal year 2016 from $168.6 million for fiscal year 2015. $12.1 million, or 86.4%, of the growth came from organic activities, while acquisitions provided the remaining $1.9 million, or 13.6%, of the overall growth in gross revenue. The growth in organic gross revenue was primarily attributable to increased demand for services from existing clients due to their continued investment in electric transmission and distribution.\nNSR increased $4.9 million, or 3.4%, to $150.6 million for fiscal year 2016 from $145.7 million for fiscal year 2015. $3.3 million, or 66.7%, of the growth came from organic activities, while acquisitions provided the remaining $1.6 million, or 33.3%, of the NSR growth. The increase in organic NSR was due to the same factors that led to the increase in gross revenue. Additionally, in the current year, we had a larger number of projects in the construction phase, resulting in higher levels of sub-contractor utilization which generates higher gross revenue yet lower NSR.\nThe Energy operating segment's profit increased $1.5 million or 4.8%, to $33.7 million for fiscal year 2016 from $32.1 million for fiscal year 2015. Organic activities accounted for $1.6 million of the increase and acquisitions accounted for a $0.1 million loss. Organic segment profit increased, primarily due to the same factors that led to the increase in NSR.

Organic activities led to a $16.4 million decrease, while acquisitions provided a positive $2.9 million change in revenue. The decrease in organic gross revenue for fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the decline in oil and gas prices, which led to a reduction of activity on midstream capital projects. In addition, we completed a large pipeline permitting project that had generated significant revenue in the comparable period of the prior year. We also recorded estimated cost increases on an Exit Strategy contract which reduced gross revenue by $3.3 million. We did not have a similar Exit Strategy related adjustment in the prior year.\nNSR decreased $3.7 million, or 1.7%, to $206.1 million for fiscal year 2016 from $209.8 million for fiscal year 2015. $5.8 million, of the decrease came from organic activities, while acquisitions provided a positive $2.2 million. The decrease in organic NSR was primarily due to the same factors that led to the decrease in gross revenue.\nThe Environmental operating segment's profit decreased $2.4 million, or 5.5%, to $41.7 million for fiscal year 2016 from $44.1 million for fiscal year 2015. Organic activities accounted for a decrease of $2.5 million, and acquisitions accounted for an increase of $0.1 million of segment profit during fiscal year 2016. The decrease in organic segment profit was primarily attributable to a decrease in employee utilization, unfavorable cost estimate adjustments on several large fixed price projects, and employee termination costs incurred in the current year associated with efforts to improve employee utilization. For fiscal year 2016, the Environmental operating segment's profit, as a percentage of NSR, decreased to 20.2% from 21.0% in the prior year.\nInfrastructure Operating Segment Results\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net service revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross revenue increased $13.2 million, or 18.8%, to $83.4 million for fiscal year 2016 from $70.2 million for fiscal year 2015.

The increased profit performance was due to the growth in revenue in addition to improvements in our cost structure. For fiscal year 2016 the Infrastructure operating segment's profit, as a percentage of NSR, increased to 21.1% from 18.7% in the prior year.\nPipeline Services Operating Segment Results\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net service revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,476\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,476\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPipeline Services operating results for fiscal year 2016 are for the post-acquisition period from November 30, 2015 to June 30, 2016. During this seven month period, Pipeline Services contributed $60.7 million in gross revenue, $48.4 million in NSR, and had a segment loss of $7.5 million. Continued uncertainty surrounding the oil and gas markets, including depressed commodity prices also impacted current period operating results. Specifically, the uncertain market outlook has constrained capital spending, resulting in lower demand for our services and increased competition for new contracts. These operating results were also impacted by $3.4 million of integration related expenses as well as $4.8 million of amortization expense.\nFiscal Year 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year 2014\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table presents the dollar and percentage changes in certain items in the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal years 2015 and 2014:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>546,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>475,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less subcontractor costs and other direct reimbursable charges\n</td> <td>138,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net service revenue\n</td> <td>408,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>354,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income from contractual arrangements\n</td> <td>97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance recoverables and other income\n</td> <td>6,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,341\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services (exclusive of costs shown separately below)\n</td> <td>337,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>312,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>37,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>5,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(118\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization\n</td> <td>3,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>30,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(134\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(169\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations before taxes\n</td> <td>30,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal and state income tax provision\n</td> <td>(11,180\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,742\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,438\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>19,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss applicable to noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income applicable to TRC Companies, Inc.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross revenue increased $70.4 million, or 14.8%, to $546.1 million for fiscal year 2015 from $475.7 million for fiscal year 2014. Acquisitions accounted for $18.8 million, or 26.7%, of the growth in gross revenue, and organic activities accounted for the remaining $51.6 million, or 73.3%, of the increase. The growth in organic gross revenue was largely driven by our Environmental operating segment, where organic gross revenue increased $41.5 million primarily due to increased demand from our oil and gas clients for services related to midstream activities. Organic gross revenue increased $7.0 million in our Infrastructure operating segment due to increased demand from state transportation and commercial clients. Organic gross revenue increased $5.0 million in our Energy operating segment due to increased demand for services associated with investments in electric transmission and distribution, as well as better performance on fixed price contracts. For comparative purposes, during fiscal 2014, we recorded estimated cost increases on two Exit Strategy contracts which reduced gross revenue by $6.9 million. We did not have similar adjustments in fiscal 2015.\nNSR increased $53.1 million, or 14.9%, to $408.0 million for fiscal year 2015 from $355.0 million for fiscal year 2014. Organic activities accounted for $38.3 million, or 72.0%, of the growth in NSR, and acquisitions accounted for the remaining $14.8 million, or 28.0%, of the increase. The increase in organic NSR was primarily attributable to our Environmental operating segment where organic NSR increased $27.3 million due to the same factors that led to the increase in gross revenue. The balance of the organic NSR growth was primarily attributable to our Energy operating segment, which increased due to the same factors that led to the increase in gross revenue, as well as the mix of projects which required higher levels of self-performance. As noted above, during fiscal 2014, we recorded estimated cost increases on two Exit Strategy contracts which reduced NSR by $6.9 million. We did not experience the same level of estimated cost increases in fiscal 2015.\nInsurance recoverables and other income decreased $11.3 million, or 63.4%, to $6.5 million for fiscal year 2015 from $17.9 million for fiscal year 2014. During fiscal year 2014, certain Exit Strategy projects had estimated cost increases which are not expected to be funded by the project-specific restricted investments and, therefore, are projected to be funded by the project-specific insurance policy procured at project inception to cover, among other things, costs in excess of the original estimates. In particular, we increased insurance recoverables by $12.4 million in the first quarter on one project, and increased insurance recoverables by $4.9 million in the third quarter on another project to account for the projected recoveries of the increased cost estimates. We did not experience the same level of estimated cost increases in fiscal 2015.\nCOS increased $25.2 million, or 8.1%, to $337.3 million for fiscal year 2015 from $312.1 million for fiscal year 2014. Organic activities accounted for $13.9 million, or 55.4%, of the increase in COS, and acquisitions accounted for the remaining $11.3\nmillion, or 44.6%, of the increase. The increase in organic COS was primarily attributable to costs incurred to support current and projected demand from our Environmental operating segment clients. For comparative purposes, however, the aforementioned estimated cost increases on two Exit Strategy contracts increased COS by $10.4 million in fiscal 2014. We did not experience the same level of estimated cost increases in fiscal 2015. As a percentage of NSR, COS was 82.7% and 87.9% for fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. This decrease in COS as a percentage of NSR was largely attributable to the prior year cost increases on Exit Strategy projects.\nG&A expenses increased $6.2 million, or 20.2%, to $37.3 million for fiscal year 2015 from $31.1 million for fiscal year 2014. As a percentage of NSR, G&A expenses were 9.1% and 8.7% for fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. This increase in G&A expenses as a percentage of NSR was primarily attributable to increased legal and litigation related costs as well as increased headcount to support our current and expected growth.\nAmortization increased $0.6 million, or 22.1%, to $3.5 million for fiscal year 2015 from $2.9 million for fiscal year 2014. The increase in amortization expense is primarily the result of additional amortization being incurred on tangible and intangible assets in connection with businesses acquired.\nThe federal, state and foreign income tax provision was $11.2 million for fiscal year 2015 compared to an income tax provision of $8.7 million for the same period in the prior fiscal year. The net federal, state and foreign income tax provision of $11.2 million for fiscal year 2015 was comprised of a current provision of $14.8 million and a deferred benefit of $3.6 million. The net federal, state and foreign income tax provision of $8.7 million for fiscal year 2014 was comprised of a current provision of $6.2 million and a deferred provision of $2.5 million. Our effective tax rate was approximately 36.5% for fiscal year 2015, compared to approximately 42.0% for fiscal year 2014. The primary reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35.0% and our overall effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 were the effect of state income taxes offset by discrete tax benefits related to the U.S. Research and Development credit. The discrete impact of research and development credits was the result of a change in estimate resulting from the finalization of a new research and development credit study during fiscal year 2015. A tax benefit for the change in estimate was reflected in its entirety in fiscal year 2015. For fiscal year 2014, the primary reconciling item between the federal statutory rate of 35.0% and our overall effective tax rate was the effect of state income taxes.\nOperating Segment Results of Operations\nEnergy Operating Segment Results\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>160,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net service revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>145,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross revenue increased $7.9 million, or 4.9%, to $168.6 million for fiscal year 2015 from $160.7 million for fiscal year 2014.

Organic activities contributed $10.2 million, or 78.8%, of the growth, while acquisitions provided the remaining $2.7 million, or 21.2%, of the NSR growth. The increase in organic NSR was due to the same factors that led to the increase in gross revenue. Additionally, in the current year, we had a larger number of projects in the engineering phase, resulting in higher levels of self-performance which generates lower gross revenue yet higher NSR.\nThe Energy operating segment's profit increased $5.7 million or 21.4%, to $32.1 million for fiscal year 2015 from $26.5 million for fiscal year 2014. Organic activities accounted for $5.6 million, or 98.2%, and acquisitions accounted for $0.1 million, or 1.8%, of the increase in segment profit during fiscal year 2015. Organic segment profit increased, primarily due to the same factors that led to the increase in NSR. For fiscal year 2015, the Energy operating segment's profit, as a percentage of NSR, increased to 22.0% from 19.9% in the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to the aforementioned improved labor utilization and improved performance on fixed price projects.\nEnvironmental Operating Segment Results\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>303,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net service revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross revenue increased $57.2 million, or 23.3%, to $303.1 million for fiscal year 2015 from $245.9 million for fiscal year 2014.

Our recognition of profit is dependent upon the accuracy of a variety of estimates including engineering progress, materials quantities, achievement of milestones and other incentives, liquidated-damages provisions, labor productivity and cost estimates. Such estimates are based on various judgments we make with respect to those factors and can be difficult to accurately determine until the project is significantly underway. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, actual completion costs often vary from estimates. If estimated total costs on any contract indicate a loss, we charge the entire estimated loss to operations in the period the loss first becomes known. If actual costs exceed the original fixed contract price, recognition of any additional revenue will be pursuant to a change order, contract modification, or claim.\nThe following table summarizes the number of projects that experienced estimated contract profit revisions relating to the revaluation of work performed in prior periods:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of projects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (reduction) in project profitability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,696\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(707\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (reduction) in project profitability by operating segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(702\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(245\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,548\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(624\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Infrastructure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(370\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>403\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pipeline Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,696\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(707\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpact of Inflation\nOur operations have not been materially affected by inflation or changing prices because most contracts of a longer term are subject to adjustment or have been priced to cover anticipated increases in labor and other costs, and the remaining contracts are short term in nature.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe primarily rely on cash from operations and financing activities, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility, to fund our operations. Our liquidity is assessed in terms of our overall ability to generate cash to fund our operating and investing activities and to service debt. We believe that our available cash, cash flows from operations and available borrowing under our revolving credit facility, discussed under \"Revolving Credit Facility\" below, will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.\nThe following table provides summarized information with respect to our cash balances and cash flows as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(126,685\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,719\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,771\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,697\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,154\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents as of the end of the fiscal year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015\nAs of June 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $(18.5) million, or (49.6)%, to $18.8 million compared to $37.3 million as of June 30, 2015. This decline is primarily the result of cash utilized for the acquisition of Pipeline Services on November 30, 2015.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $16.0 million, or 49.9%, to $48.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, compared to $32.1 million of cash provided in the prior year. The increase was attributable to the favorable timing of collections activity with respect to accounts receivable in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of the prior year. These favorable results were offset by higher cash payments made primarily with respect to accounts payable and employee related compensation in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of the prior year.\nAccounts receivable include both: (1) billed receivables associated with invoices submitted for work performed and (2) unbilled receivables (work in progress). The unbilled receivables are primarily related to work performed in the last month of the year. The efficiency of the billing and collection process is commonly evaluated as days sales outstanding (\"DSO\"), which we calculate by dividing accounts receivable by the most recent three-month average of daily gross revenue. DSO, which measures the collections turnover of both billed and unbilled receivables, declined to 79 days as of June 30, 2016 from 83 days as of June 30, 2015.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $109.0 million, or 615.0%, to $126.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, compared to $17.7 million of cash used in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to $107.4 million in additional cash payments for the acquisitions of businesses including earnout and net working capital payments in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, as well as $1.7 million of additional payments for property and equipment. Both of these aforementioned increases were primarily attributable to the acquisition of Pipeline Services.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased by $64.8 million, or 1,378.5%, to $60.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, compared to $4.7 million of cash used in the prior year. The increase was directly attributable to the proceeds received on debt incurred, net of issuance costs paid, for the acquisition of Pipeline Services.\nFiscal Year 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year 2014\nAs of June 30, 2015, cash and cash equivalents increased by $9.7 million, or 35.1%, to $37.3 million compared to $27.6 million as of June 30, 2014.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $10.7 million, or 50.2%, to $32.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, compared to $21.4 million of cash provided in the prior fiscal year. The increase was due to higher income, adjusted for non-cash charges, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period of the prior year, as well as the favorable impact in fiscal 2015 from changes in our working capital accounts.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $10.9 million, or 161.7%, to $17.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, compared to $6.8 million of cash used in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to $8.2 million in additional cash payments for the acquisitions of businesses including earnout and net working capital payments in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, as well as $1.5 million of additional payments for property and equipment.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased by $0.5 million, or 8.9%, to $4.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, compared to $5.2 million of cash used in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to $4.0 million of additional payments made on long-term debt and capital lease obligations in fiscal 2014, which were partially offset by a $3.0 million reduction of excess tax benefits from stock-based awards in fiscal 2015.\nLong-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations\nLong-term debt and capital lease obligations as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 were comprised of the following (in thousands):\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving facility\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractor-owned, contractor-operated facility debt\n</td> <td>21,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt - note payable\n</td> <td>5,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease financing obligations\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less deferred debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>(1,150\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>97,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less current portion\n</td> <td>(18,339\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(216\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt and capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevolving Credit Facility\nPreviously, we and substantially all of our subsidiaries, were party to a secured credit agreement (the \"Prior Credit Agreement\") and related security documentation with Citizens Commercial Banking as lender, administrative agent, sole lead arranger, and sole book runner and JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. as lender and syndication agent. The Prior Credit Agreement provided us with a $75.0 million five-year secured revolving credit facility with a sublimit of $15.0 million available for the issuance of letters of credit. Pursuant to the terms of the Prior Credit Agreement, we could request an increase in the amount of the credit facility up to $95.0 million. The expiration date of the Prior Credit Agreement was April 16, 2018.\nAmounts outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement bore interest at the Base Rate (as defined, generally the prime rate) plus a margin of 1.00% to 1.50% or at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00% to 2.50%, based on the ratio (measured over a trailing four-quarter period) of consolidated total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), as defined. Our obligations under the Prior Credit Agreement were secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets and guaranteed by our principal operating subsidiaries. The Prior Credit Agreement also contained cross-default provisions which became effective if we defaulted on other indebtedness.\nUnder the Prior Credit Agreement we were required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.25 to 1.00 and to not permit our leverage ratio to exceed 2.00 to 1.00. The Prior Credit Agreement also required us to achieve minimum levels\nof Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $20.0 million for the twelve-month periods ending June 30, 2015 and thereafter. The Prior Credit Agreement also limited the payment of cash dividends to $10.0 million in aggregate during its term. We were in compliance with the financial covenants under the Prior Credit Agreement through its termination date.\nOn November 30, 2015, we entered into a five-year credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement\u201d) with Citizens Bank, N.A. as lender, LC issuer, administrative agent, sole lead arranger, and sole book runner; BMO Harris Bank, N.A. as lender, LC issuer and syndication agent; KeyBank, N.A. as lender and document agent, and five other banks as lenders . The New Credit Agreement provides us with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $175.0 million, consisting of a $100.0 million five-year secured revolving credit facility ( Revolving Facility\u201d) with a sub-limit of $15.0 million available for the issuance of letters of credit, as well as a five-year secured $75.0 million term loan ( Term Loan\u201d). The New Credit Agreement replaced our Prior Credit Agreement.\nThe proceeds of the Term Loan, together with cash on hand and proceeds from borrowing under the Revolving Facility, were used to pay the purchase price for Willbros Professional Services and to fund transaction costs incurred in connection with the Willbros Professional Services acquisition. The Revolving Facility will also be available for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Revolving Facility includes borrowing capacity for letters of credit and for borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans.\u201d Borrowings under the Revolving Facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including absence of defaults and accuracy of representations and warranties. We may request an increase in the amount of the Credit Agreement up to an additional $75.0 million, which may be through additional term or revolving loans.\nBorrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility will mature on November 30, 2020. The Term Loan amortizes in quarterly installments payable on the last day of each March, June, September, and December, commencing on March 31, 2016 in amounts equal to 1.875% of the term loan made or outstanding, with the balance payable on November 30, 2020 (the \"Term Loan Maturity Date.\") In addition, we are required, subject to certain exceptions, to make payments on the Term Loan: (a) based on a stated percentage of Excess Cash Flow, either 50% or 0% depending on whether our consolidated leverage ratio is above or below 2 times adjusted EBITDA as defined in the New Credit Agreement; (b) in an amount of 100% of net cash proceeds from asset sales subject to certain reinvestment rights; (c) in an amount of 100% of net cash proceeds of any issuance of debt other than debt permitted to be incurred under the New Credit Agreement; and, (d) in an amount of 100% of net cash proceeds from events of loss subject to certain reinvestment rights. The borrowings under the New Credit Agreement may be reduced, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty.\nAmounts outstanding under the New Credit Agreement bear interest at the Base Rate (as defined, generally the prime rate) plus a margin of 0.50% to 1.25%, or at the Eurodollar Rate (as defined, generally the LIBOR rate) plus a margin of 1.50% to 2.25%, based on the Company's Leverage Ratio (as defined). In addition to these borrowing rates, there is a commitment fee which ranges from 0.20% to 0.375% on any unused commitments. The applicable fees for issuance of letters of credit under the Revolving Facility range from 1.50% to 2.25%.\nOur obligations under the New Credit Agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets and guaranteed by our principal operating subsidiaries. The New Credit Agreement also contains cross-default provisions which become effective if we default on other indebtedness.\nThe New Credit Agreement contains various customary restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness including guarantees; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; make investments, loans or acquisitions; grant or incur liens on our assets; sell our assets; engage in mergers, consolidations, liquidations or dissolutions; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make restricted payments. Under the New Credit Agreement we are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.25 to 1.00 and to not permit our leverage ratio to exceed 3.00 to 1.00. Additionally, the New Credit Agreement also limits the payment of cash dividends to $10.0 million in aggregate during its term.\nThe actual covenant results as compared to the covenant requirements under the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2016 for the measurement periods described below are as follows:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Measurement Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Required\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum leverage ratio\n</td> <td>Trailing 12 months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.41 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Not to exceed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.00 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum fixed charge coverage ratio\n</td> <td>Trailing 12 months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.44 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Must exceed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.25 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn November 30, 2015 we borrowed $102.0 million under the New Credit Agreement to partially fund the Willbros Professional Services acquisition. The borrowing was comprised of a full borrowing of the $75.0 million term loan and a $27.0 million borrowing under the Revolving Facility. Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at a stated rate of 2.32% and have\nan effective interest rate of 2.74% at June 30, 2016. As of June 30, 2016 we had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility and $72.2 million outstanding under the Term Loan. Funds available to borrow under the New Credit Agreement, after consideration of the letters of credit outstanding, were $97.2 million at June 30, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the New Credit Agreement.\nAs of June 30, 2015, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement. Letters of credit outstanding were $2.0 million as of June 30, 2015. Based upon the leverage covenant, the maximum availability under the Prior Credit Agreement was $75.0 million as of June 30, 2015. Funds available to borrow under the Prior Credit Agreement, after consideration of the letters of credit outstanding and other indebtedness outstanding of $0.2 million, were $72.8 million at June 30, 2015.\nContractor-owned, contractor-operated facility debt\nAs of June 30, 2016, we recorded approximately $21.3 million of debt obligations assumed in the Pipeline Services acquisition, of which $7.6 million was current. A third party finance company had provided financing to Pipeline Services in conjunction with the construction of fueling facilities for the federal government. Upon acceptance of the constructed facilities, the federal government pays Pipeline Services in equal monthly installments over the subsequent five years pursuant to a contract. Therefore, as of June 30, 2016, we also recorded approximately $22.4 million of receivables which were acquired in the transaction, of which $7.6 million was current. These amounts were recorded within other assets and represent the amount due from the federal government for the construction of the fueling facilities.\nAs of June 30, 2016, the government has provided acceptance on all three of these contracts and final funding has been received on two contracts.\nOther Notes Payable\nIn July 2015, we financed $5.6 million of insurance premiums payable in eleven equal monthly installments of $0.5 million each, including a finance charge of 1.99%. In December 2015, an additional $0.9 million was financed in conjunction with the Willbros Professional Services acquisition, resulting in six remaining payments of $0.7 million. As of June 30, 2016, the balance was paid in full.\nIn conjunction with the Pipeline Services acquisition, we were required to remit a second cash payment of $7.5 million payable at the earlier of certain Willbros contract novations (or written approval of a subcontract) and Willbros obtaining certain consents, or March 15, 2016. The second cash payment was made in two tranches, with $2.4 million paid in March 2016 and the remaining balance paid in July 2016 in conjunction with the final net working capital settlement.\nCapital Lease Obligations\nDuring fiscal years 2013 and 2012, we financed $1.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of furniture, office equipment, and computer equipment under capital lease agreements which expired in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. The assets and liabilities under capital lease agreements were recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the asset. The assets were amortized over the shorter of their related lease terms or their estimated useful lives. Amortization of assets under capital leases was included in depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based upon current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of certain events may differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" beginning on page 11 and in the section entitled \"Forward-Looking Statements\" on page 3.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a firm that provides integrated engineering, consulting, and construction management services. Our project teams help our commercial and governmental clients implement environmental, energy, infrastructure, and pipeline projects from initial concept to delivery and operation. We provide our services almost entirely in the United States of America.\nWe generate revenue and cash flows from fees for professional and technical services. As a service company, we are more labor-intensive than capital-intensive. Our revenue and cash flow is driven by our ability to attract and retain qualified and productive employees, identify business opportunities, secure new and renew existing client contracts, provide outstanding service to our clients and execute projects successfully. Our income from operations is derived from our ability to generate revenue under our contracts in excess of our direct costs, subcontractor costs, other contract costs, and general and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses.\nIn the course of providing our services, we routinely subcontract services. Generally, these subcontractor costs are passed through to our clients and, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") and consistent with industry practice, are included in gross revenue. Because subcontractor services can change significantly from project to project, changes in gross revenue may not be indicative of business trends. Accordingly, we also report net service revenue (\"NSR\"), which is gross revenue less subcontractor costs and other direct reimbursable charges, and our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations uses NSR as a primary point of reference.\nThe following table presents the approximate percentage of NSR by contract type:\n\nOur cost of services (\"COS\") includes professional compensation and related benefits together with certain direct and indirect costs such as rents, utilities and travel. Professional compensation represents the majority of these costs. Our G&A expenses are comprised primarily of our corporate headquarters costs related to corporate executive management, finance, accounting, information technology, administration and legal. These costs are generally unrelated to specific client projects and can vary as expenses are incurred to support corporate activities and initiatives.\nOur revenue, expenses and operating results may fluctuate significantly from year to year as a result of numerous factors, including:\n \u2022 Unanticipated changes in contract performance that may affect profitability, particularly with contracts that are fixed-price or have funding limits; \n \u2022 Seasonality of the spending cycle, notably for state and local government entities, and the spending patterns of our commercial sector clients; \n \u2022 Budget constraints experienced by our federal, state and local government clients; \n \u2022 Divestitures or discontinuance of operating units; \n \u2022 The timing and impact of acquisitions; \n \u2022 Employee hiring, utilization and turnover rates; \n \u2022 The number and significance of client contracts commenced and completed during the period; \n \u2022 Creditworthiness and solvency of clients; \n \u2022 The ability of our clients to terminate contracts without penalties; \n \u2022 Delays incurred in connection with contracts; \n \u2022 The size, scope and payment terms of contracts; \n \u2022 Contract negotiations on change orders and collection of related accounts receivable; \n \u2022 The timing of expenses incurred for corporate initiatives; \n \u2022 Competition; \n \u2022 Litigation; \n \u2022 Changes in accounting rules; \n \u2022 The credit markets and their effect on our customers; \n \u2022 General economic or political conditions; and \n \u2022 Employee expenses such as medical and other benefits. \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisitions. We continuously evaluate the marketplace for strategic acquisition opportunities. A fundamental component of our profitable growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions that will expand our platform in key U.S. markets. Where the impact of acquisitions is noted in discussing results, it refers to acquisitions effected within the last twelve months of the end of the relevant period.\nFiscal Year 2016 Acquisition\nOn November 30, 2015, we acquired the Professional Services business (\"Pipeline Services\") of Willbros Group (\"Willbros\") in an all cash transaction. The $124.5 million purchase price consisted of (i) an initial cash payment of $120.0 million paid at closing, and, (ii) a second cash payment due of $7.5 million payable at the earlier of certain Willbros contract novations (or written approval of a subcontract) and Willbros obtaining certain consents, or March 15, 2016, net of a preliminary estimate working capital adjustment due from Willbros. The second cash payment was made in two tranches, with $2.4 million paid in March 2016 and the remaining balance paid in July 2016 in conjunction with the final net working capital settlement. Goodwill of $60.3 million was initially recorded prior to impairment, all of which is expected to be tax deductible, and other intangible assets of $44.5 million were recorded as a result of this acquisition. The goodwill recognized is attributable to the future strategic growth opportunities arising from the acquisition, Pipeline Service's highly skilled assembled workforce, which does not qualify for separate recognition, and the expected cost synergies of the combined operations. The Pipeline Services operating segment has contributed $60.7 million in gross revenue, $48.4 million in net service revenue, and an operating loss of $(7.5) million to our results for the period from November 30, 2015 through June 30, 2016.\nFiscal Year 2015 Acquisition\nOn September 29, 2014, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of NOVA Training Inc. and all of the outstanding membership interests of NOVA Earthworks, LLC (collectively \"NOVA\") based in Midland, Texas. NOVA provides safety training and environmental services as well as oil spill response, remediation and general oil field construction services to customers in the oil and gas industry. The initial purchase price consisted of (i) a cash payment of $7.2 million payable at closing, (ii) a second cash payment of $2.6 million placed into escrow, of which $0.5 million was paid in six months and the remaining $2.1 million was paid in 18 months, (iii) 50 thousand shares of our common stock valued at $0.3 million on the closing date, and (iv) a $0.6 million net working capital adjustment. The sellers are also entitled to up to $1.5 million in contingent cash consideration through an earn-out provision based on the NSR performance of the acquired firm over the 24 month period following closing. We estimated the fair value of the remaining contingent earn-out liability to be $0.3 million based on the projections and probabilities of reaching the performance goals through September 2016. Goodwill of $3.7 million, none of which is expected to be tax deductible, and other intangible assets of $3.6 million were recorded as a result of this acquisition. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the synergies and ancillary growth opportunities expected to arise after the acquisition. The fair values of assets and liabilities of the NOVA acquisition have been recorded in the Environmental operating segment. The impact of this acquisition was not material to our condensed consolidated balance sheets and results of operations.\nFiscal Year 2014 Acquisitions\nOn January 2, 2014, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of EMCOR Energy Services, Inc. (\"EES\"), a subsidiary of EMCOR Group, Inc., headquartered in San Francisco, California. EES provides engineering and related consulting services to utilities to support their energy programs in California. Services include engineering, technical review, verification, and administration of utilities' energy efficiency programs. The purchase price of $1.6 million consisted of a cash payment of $1.4 million, and a $0.2 million net working capital adjustment. Goodwill of $0.2 million, none of which is expected to be tax deductible, and other intangible assets of $0.9 million were recorded as a result of this acquisition. The EES acquisition has been recorded in the Energy operating segment. The impact of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated balance sheets and results of operations.\nOn July 22, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Utility Support Systems, Inc. (\"USS\"), headquartered in Douglasville, Georgia. USS provides engineering and related services primarily supporting the power/utility market. The purchase price of $5.0 million consisted of: (i) cash of $2.5 million payable at closing, (ii) a second cash payment of $1.8 million payable on the one-year anniversary of the closing date subject to withholding for various contractual issues, and (iii) 34 thousand shares of our common stock valued at $0.3 million on the closing date. The selling shareholders were also entitled to contingent cash consideration through an earn-out provision based on NSR performance of the acquired firm over the twelve month period following closing. We estimated the fair value of the contingent earn-out liability to be $0.5 million based on the projections and probabilities of reaching the performance goals through July 2014. The earnout goals were not achieved, and the liability was subsequently reversed in fiscal year 2014. Goodwill of $2.2 million, none of which is expected to be tax deductible, and other intangible assets of $2.1 million were recorded as a result of this acquisition. The USS acquisition has been recorded in the Energy operating segment. The impact of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated balance sheets and results of operations.\nOperating Segments\nWe manage our business under the following four operating segments:\nEnergy: The Energy operating segment provides services to a range of clients including energy companies, power utilities, other commercial entities, and state and federal government entities. Our services include program management, engineer/procure/construct projects, design, and consulting. Our typical projects involve upgrades, design and new construction for electric transmission and distribution systems and substations; energy efficiency program design and management; and renewable energy development and power generation.\nEnvironmental: The Environmental operating segment provides services to a wide range of clients including industrial, transportation, energy and natural resource companies, as well as federal, state and municipal agencies. The Environmental operating segment is organized to focus on key areas of demand including: environmental management of buildings and facilities; air quality measurements and modeling of potential air pollution impacts; water quality and water resource management; assessment and remediation of contaminated sites and buildings; hazardous waste management; construction monitoring, inspection and management; environmental, health and safety management and sustainability advisory services; compliance auditing and strategic due diligence; environmental licensing and permitting of a wide variety of projects; and natural and cultural resource assessment, protection and management.\nInfrastructure: The Infrastructure operating segment provides services related to the expansion of infrastructure capacity, and the rehabilitation of overburdened and deteriorating infrastructure systems. Our client base is predominantly state and municipal governments as well as select commercial developers. In addition, we provide infrastructure services on projects originating in our Energy and Environmental operating segments. Primary services include: roadway, bridge and related surface transportation design; structural design and inspection of bridges; program management; construction engineering inspection and construction management for roads and bridges; civil engineering for municipalities and public works departments; geotechnical engineering services; and security assessments, design and construction management.\nPipeline Services: The Pipeline Services operating segment provides pipeline and facilities engineering, EPC/EPCM, field services and integrity services to the oil and gas transmission and midstream markets, as well as at government facilities. We specialize in providing engineering services to assist clients in designing, engineering and constructing or expanding pipeline systems, compressor stations, pump stations, fuel storage facilities, terminals, and field gathering and production facilities. Our expertise extends to the engineering of a wide range of project peripherals, including various types of support buildings and utility systems, power generation and electrical transmission systems, communications systems, fire protection, water and sewage treatment, water transmission, roads and railroad sidings. We also provide project management, engineering and material procurement services to the refining industry and government agencies, including mechanical, civil, structural, electrical instrumentation/controls and environmental engineering. We provide\nfull-service integrity management program offerings including program development, data services, risk analysis, corrosion evaluation, integrity engineering and integrity construction services. We are partnered with Google to provide a cloud-based pipeline life-cycle integrity management solution, Integra Link\u2122, which utilizes Google's geospatial technology platform to help oil and gas pipeline companies visualize and utilize their data and information.\nOur chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"). Our CEO manages the business by evaluating the financial results of the four operating segments, focusing primarily on segment revenue and segment profit. We utilize segment revenue and segment profit because we believe they provide useful information for effectively allocating resources among operating segments; evaluating the health of our operating segments based on metrics that management can actively influence; and gauging our investments and our ability to service, incur or pay down debt. Specifically, our CEO evaluates segment revenue and segment profit and assesses the performance of each operating segment based on these measures, as well as, among other things, the prospects of each of the operating segments and how they fit into our overall strategy. Our CEO then decides how resources should be allocated among our operating segments. We do not track our assets by operating segment, and consequently, it is not practical to show assets by operating segment. Segment profit includes all operating expenses except the following: costs associated with providing corporate shared services (including certain depreciation and amortization), goodwill and intangible asset write-offs, stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation expense is primarily allocated to operating segments based upon their respective use of total operating segment office space. Assets solely used by Corporate are not allocated to the operating segments. Inter-segment balances and transactions are not material. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those for us as a whole except as discussed herein.\nThe following table presents the approximate percentage of our NSR by operating segment:\n\nBusiness Trend Analysis\nEnergy: The utilities in the United States are in the midst of a multi-year upgrade of the electric transmission grid to improve capacity, reliability and distribution of sources of generation. Years of underinvestment coupled with a favorable regulatory environment have provided a good business opportunity for those serving this market. According to the Edison Electric Institute, electric utilities throughout the United States will be investing over $60 billion in the performance of this work over the next several years. Economic impacts have slowed the pace of this investment, yet they do not appear to have affected the long term plan of investment. Demand for energy efficiency services continues to be supported by increasing state and federal funds targeted at energy efficiency. The Regional Green House Gas Initiative and system benefit charges at the state or utility level have expanded the marketplace for energy efficiency program management services. Investment within the renewable portfolios also remains strong. We are well established in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions and are growing our presence in the Southeast and in Texas and California where demand for services is the highest.\nEnvironmental: Although there had been signs of growth in this market following a slowdown caused by general economic conditions, market demand for environmental services continues to be mixed. The last decade saw growth in nearly all aspects of this market. The fundamental market drivers remain in place, and this market also benefits from evolving regulatory developments particularly with respect to air quality, and the continuing need to enhance our aging transportation and energy infrastructure. While we expect oil and gas activity and major capital projects to be constrained in the near term, the outlook for services related to other areas of the market, such as environmental remediation, construction, transaction support, the retirement of coal plants and the need to transport natural gas remains favorable. Renewables and other energy source initiatives present important market opportunities but are linked to federal and state policy changes which will be required for the markets to commit long-term capital to projects such as pipelines and related infrastructure.\nInfrastructure: Long-term prospects should be favorable and our backlog is up significantly. The overall infrastructure construction markets are expected to benefit from the federal funding certainty provided by the new $305 billion highway bill known as the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act. The bill calls for the spending of approximately $205 billion on highways and $48 billion on transit projects.\nPipeline Services: Our Pipeline Services segment is currently in the midst of a market downturn due to low oil and gas prices and uncertainty in the oil and gas markets. Nevertheless, long-term opportunities include mid-stream oil and natural gas liquid pipelines which are necessary to match takeaway capacity with levels of production, some of which is stranded due to inadequate pipeline infrastructure, primarily in the Marcellus and Utica shales. Additional future opportunities are presented by natural gas pipelines to take gas to LNG export facilities as well as Mexico and Latin America. Furthermore natural gas pipelines will be required as coal plants are retired and replaced with cleaner gas-burning plants. New regulatory requirements proposed by the Department of Transportation will lead to data and integrity requirements for pipeline operators where our technologies and services can be utilized.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions. We use our best judgment in the assumptions used to compile these estimates, which are based on current facts and circumstances, prior experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are the policies which are most critical in the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations:\nRevenue Recognition-We recognize contract revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Specifically, we follow the guidance in ASC Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts.\nFixed-Price Contracts\nWe recognize revenue on fixed-price contracts using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method of revenue recognition, we estimate the progress towards completion to determine the amount of revenue and profit to recognize on all significant contracts. We generally utilize an efforts-expended, cost-to-cost approach in applying the percentage-of-completion method under which revenue is earned in proportion to total costs incurred divided by total costs expected to be incurred.\nUnder the percentage-of-completion method, recognition of profit is dependent upon the accuracy of a variety of estimates including engineering progress, materials quantities, achievement of milestones and other incentives, liquidated-damages provisions, labor productivity and cost estimates. Such estimates are based on various judgments we make with respect to those factors and can be difficult to accurately determine until the project is significantly underway. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, actual completion costs often vary from estimates. If estimated total costs on any contract indicate a loss, we charge the entire estimated loss to operations in the period the loss first becomes known. If actual costs exceed the original fixed contract price, recognition of any additional revenue will be pursuant to a change order, contract modification, or claim.\nWe have entered into fixed-price Exit Strategy contracts to remediate environmental conditions at contaminated sites. Under most Exit Strategy contracts, the majority of the contract price was deposited by the client into a restricted account with an insurer. The funds in the restricted account are held by the insurer and used to pay us as work is performed. The arrangement with the insurer provides for the deposited funds to earn interest at the one-year constant maturity United States Treasury Bill rate. The interest is recorded when earned and reported as interest income from contractual arrangements on the consolidated statements of operations. On certain Exit Strategy projects, we have taken title to the underlying properties in order to facilitate access, remedial construction, performance of operations monitoring and maintenance activities, and the overall execution of the cleanup. As these properties are distressed, they have no value.\nThe Exit Strategy funds held by the insurer, including any interest thereon, are recorded as an asset (current and long-term restricted investment) on our consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding liability (current and long-term deferred revenue) related to the funds. Consistent with our other fixed-price contracts, we recognize revenue on Exit Strategy contracts using the percentage-of-completion method. When determining the extent of progress towards completion on Exit Strategy contracts, prepaid insurance premiums and fees are amortized, on a straight-line basis, to cost incurred over the life of the related insurance policy. Certain Exit Strategy contracts were classified as pertaining to either remediation or operation, maintenance and monitoring. In addition, certain Exit Strategy contracts were segmented such that the remediation and operation portion of the contract is separately accounted for from the maintenance and monitoring portion.\nUnder most Exit Strategy contracts, additional payments were made by the client to the insurer, typically through an insurance broker, for insurance premiums and fees for a policy to cover potential costs in excess of the original estimates and other factors\nsuch as third party liability. For Exit Strategy contracts where we establish that (1) costs exceed the contract value and interest growth thereon and (2) such costs are covered by insurance, we record an estimated insurance recovery up to the amount of insured costs. An insurance gain, that is, an amount to be recovered in excess of our recorded costs, is not recognized until the receipt of insurance proceeds. Insurance recoveries are reported as insurance recoverables and other income on our consolidated statements of operations. If estimated total costs on any contract indicate a loss, we charge the entire estimated loss to operations in the period the loss first becomes known.\nUnit price contracts are a subset of fixed-price contracts. Under unit price contracts, our clients pay a set fee for each unit of service or production. We recognize revenue under unit price contracts as we complete the related service transaction for our clients. If our costs per service transaction exceed original estimates, our profit margins will decrease, and we may realize a loss on the project unless we can receive payment for the additional costs.\nTime-and-Materials Contracts\nUnder time-and-materials contracts, we negotiate hourly billing rates and charge our clients based on the actual time that we expend on a project. In addition, clients reimburse us for actual out-of-pocket costs of materials and other direct reimbursable expenses that we incur in connection with our performance under the contract. Our profit margins on time-and-materials contracts fluctuate based on actual labor and overhead costs that we directly charge or allocate to contracts compared to negotiated billing rates. Revenue on time-and-materials contracts is recognized based on the actual number of hours we spend on the projects plus any actual out-of-pocket costs of materials and other direct reimbursable expenses that we incur on the projects.\nCost-Plus Contracts\nCost-Plus Fixed Fee Contracts. Under our cost-plus fixed fee contracts, we charge clients for our costs, including both direct and indirect costs, plus a fixed negotiated fee. In negotiating a cost-plus fixed fee contract, we estimate all recoverable direct and indirect costs and then add a fixed profit component. The total estimated cost plus the negotiated fee represents the total contract value. We recognize revenue based on the actual labor and non-labor costs we incur plus the portion of the fixed fee we have earned to date.\nCost-Plus Fixed Rate Contracts. Under our cost-plus fixed rate contracts, we charge clients for our costs plus negotiated rates based on our indirect costs. In negotiating a cost-plus fixed rate contract, we estimate all recoverable direct and indirect costs and then add a profit component, which is a percentage of total recoverable costs, to arrive at a total dollar estimate for the project. We recognize revenue based on the actual total costs we have expended plus the applicable fixed rate. If the actual total costs are lower than the total costs we have estimated, our revenue from that project will be lower than originally estimated.\nChange Orders/Claims\nChange orders are modifications to an original contract that change the provisions of the contract. Change orders typically result from changes in scope, specifications or design, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites, or period of completion of the work. Claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price that we seek to collect from our clients or others for delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders that are either in dispute or are unapproved as to both scope and price, or other causes.\nCosts related to change orders and claims are recognized when they are incurred. Change orders are included in total estimated contract revenue when it is probable that the change order will result in a bona fide addition to contract value and can be reliably estimated. Claims are included in total estimated contract revenues only to the extent that contract costs related to the claims have been incurred and when it is probable that the claim will result in a bona fide addition to contract value which can be reliably estimated. No profit is recognized on claims until final settlement occurs. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we did not recognize any revenue related to claims.\nOther Contract Matters\nFederal Acquisition Regulations (\"FAR\"), which are applicable to our federal government contracts and may be incorporated in many local and state agency contracts, limit the recovery of certain specified indirect costs on contracts. Cost-plus contracts covered by FAR or with certain state and local agencies also require an audit of actual costs and provide for upward or downward adjustments if actual recoverable costs differ from billed recoverable costs. Most of our federal government contracts are subject to termination at the discretion of the client. Contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of such termination.\nContracts with the federal government are subject to audit, primarily by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (\"DCAA\"), which reviews our overhead rates, operating systems and cost proposals. During the course of its audits, the DCAA may disallow costs if it determines that we have accounted for such costs in a manner inconsistent with Cost Accounting Standards or FAR. Our last incurred cost audit was for fiscal year 2004 and resulted in an immaterial adjustment. DCAA determined that an audit of incurred\ncost proposals submitted to DCAA for fiscal years 2005 through 2013 was not required. Historically, we have not had any material cost disallowances by the DCAA as a result of audit, however there can be no assurance that DCAA audits will not result in material cost disallowances in the future.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts-An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our clients to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts has been determined through reviews of specific amounts deemed to be uncollectible and estimated write-offs as a result of clients who have filed for bankruptcy protection plus an allowance for other amounts for which some loss is determined to be probable based on current circumstances. If the financial condition of clients or our assessment as to collectability were to change, adjustments to the allowances may be required.\nIncome Taxes-We are required to estimate the provision for income taxes, including the current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of assets and liabilities for tax and financial accounting purposes. These differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, together with net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards and tax credits are recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. An assessment is required to be made of the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent that we determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred asset will not be utilized, a valuation allowance is established. Taxable income in future periods significantly above or below that projected will cause adjustments to the valuation allowance that could materially decrease or increase future income tax expense.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based upon current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of certain events may differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" beginning on page 11 and in the section entitled \"Forward-Looking Statements\" on page 3.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a firm that provides integrated engineering, consulting, and construction management services. Our project teams help our commercial and governmental clients implement environmental, energy, infrastructure, and pipeline projects from initial concept to delivery and operation. We provide our services almost entirely in the United States of America.\nWe generate revenue and cash flows from fees for professional and technical services. As a service company, we are more labor-intensive than capital-intensive. Our revenue and cash flow is driven by our ability to attract and retain qualified and productive employees, identify business opportunities, secure new and renew existing client contracts, provide outstanding service to our clients and execute projects successfully. Our income from operations is derived from our ability to generate revenue under our contracts in excess of our direct costs, subcontractor costs, other contract costs, and general and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses.\nIn the course of providing our services, we routinely subcontract services. Generally, these subcontractor costs are passed through to our clients and, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") and consistent with industry practice, are included in gross revenue. Because subcontractor services can change significantly from project to project, changes in gross revenue may not be indicative of business trends. Accordingly, we also report net service revenue (\"NSR\"), which is gross revenue less subcontractor costs and other direct reimbursable charges, and our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations uses NSR as a primary point of reference.\nThe following table presents the approximate percentage of NSR by contract type:\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time-and-materials\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed-price\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost-plus\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur cost of services (\"COS\") includes professional compensation and related benefits together with certain direct and indirect costs such as rents, utilities and travel. Professional compensation represents the majority of these costs. Our G&A expenses are comprised primarily of our corporate headquarters costs related to corporate executive management, finance, accounting, information technology, administration and legal. These costs are generally unrelated to specific client projects and can vary as expenses are incurred to support corporate activities and initiatives.\nOur revenue, expenses and operating results may fluctuate significantly from year to year as a result of numerous factors, including:\n \u2022 Unanticipated changes in contract performance that may affect profitability, particularly with contracts that are fixed-price or have funding limits; \n \u2022 Seasonality of the spending cycle, notably for state and local government entities, and the spending patterns of our commercial sector clients; \n \u2022 Budget constraints experienced by our federal, state and local government clients; \n \u2022 Divestitures or discontinuance of operating units; \n \u2022 The timing and impact of acquisitions; \n \u2022 Employee hiring, utilization and turnover rates; \n \u2022 The number and significance of client contracts commenced and completed during the period; \n \u2022 Creditworthiness and solvency of clients; \n \u2022 The ability of our clients to terminate contracts without penalties; \n \u2022 Delays incurred in connection with contracts; \n \u2022 The size, scope and payment terms of contracts; \n \u2022 Contract negotiations on change orders and collection of related accounts receivable; \n \u2022 The timing of expenses incurred for corporate initiatives; \n \u2022 Competition; \n \u2022 Litigation; \n \u2022 Changes in accounting rules; \n \u2022 The credit markets and their effect on our customers; \n \u2022 General economic or political conditions; and \n \u2022 Employee expenses such as medical and other benefits. \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisitions. We continuously evaluate the marketplace for strategic acquisition opportunities. A fundamental component of our profitable growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions that will expand our platform in key U.S. markets. Where the impact of acquisitions is noted in discussing results, it refers to acquisitions effected within the last twelve months of the end of the relevant period.\nFiscal Year 2016 Acquisition\nOn November 30, 2015, we acquired the Professional Services business (\"Pipeline Services\") of Willbros Group (\"Willbros\") in an all cash transaction. The $124.5 million purchase price consisted of (i) an initial cash payment of $120.0 million paid at closing, and, (ii) a second cash payment due of $7.5 million payable at the earlier of certain Willbros contract novations (or written approval of a subcontract) and Willbros obtaining certain consents, or March 15, 2016, net of a preliminary estimate working capital adjustment due from Willbros. The second cash payment was made in two tranches, with $2.4 million paid in March 2016 and the remaining balance paid in July 2016 in conjunction with the final net working capital settlement. Goodwill of $60.3 million was initially recorded prior to impairment, all of which is expected to be tax deductible, and other intangible assets of $44.5 million were recorded as a result of this acquisition. The goodwill recognized is attributable to the future strategic growth opportunities arising from the acquisition, Pipeline Service's highly skilled assembled workforce, which does not qualify for separate recognition, and the expected cost synergies of the combined operations. The Pipeline Services operating segment has contributed $60.7 million in gross revenue, $48.4 million in net service revenue, and an operating loss of $(7.5) million to our results for the period from November 30, 2015 through June 30, 2016.\nFiscal Year 2015 Acquisition\nOn September 29, 2014, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of NOVA Training Inc. and all of the outstanding membership interests of NOVA Earthworks, LLC (collectively \"NOVA\") based in Midland, Texas. NOVA provides safety training and environmental services as well as oil spill response, remediation and general oil field construction services to customers in the oil and gas industry. The initial purchase price consisted of (i) a cash payment of $7.2 million payable at closing, (ii) a second cash payment of $2.6 million placed into escrow, of which $0.5 million was paid in six months and the remaining $2.1 million was paid in 18 months, (iii) 50 thousand shares of our common stock valued at $0.3 million on the closing date, and (iv) a $0.6 million net working capital adjustment. The sellers are also entitled to up to $1.5 million in contingent cash consideration through an earn-out provision based on the NSR performance of the acquired firm over the 24 month period following closing. We estimated the fair value of the remaining contingent earn-out liability to be $0.3 million based on the projections and probabilities of reaching the performance goals through September 2016. Goodwill of $3.7 million, none of which is expected to be tax deductible, and other intangible assets of $3.6 million were recorded as a result of this acquisition. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the synergies and ancillary growth opportunities expected to arise after the acquisition. The fair values of assets and liabilities of the NOVA acquisition have been recorded in the Environmental operating segment. The impact of this acquisition was not material to our condensed consolidated balance sheets and results of operations.\nFiscal Year 2014 Acquisitions\nOn January 2, 2014, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of EMCOR Energy Services, Inc. (\"EES\"), a subsidiary of EMCOR Group, Inc., headquartered in San Francisco, California. EES provides engineering and related consulting services to utilities to support their energy programs in California. Services include engineering, technical review, verification, and administration of utilities' energy efficiency programs. The purchase price of $1.6 million consisted of a cash payment of $1.4 million, and a $0.2 million net working capital adjustment. Goodwill of $0.2 million, none of which is expected to be tax deductible, and other intangible assets of $0.9 million were recorded as a result of this acquisition. The EES acquisition has been recorded in the Energy operating segment. The impact of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated balance sheets and results of operations.\nOn July 22, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Utility Support Systems, Inc. (\"USS\"), headquartered in Douglasville, Georgia. USS provides engineering and related services primarily supporting the power/utility market. The purchase price of $5.0 million consisted of: (i) cash of $2.5 million payable at closing, (ii) a second cash payment of $1.8 million payable on the one-year anniversary of the closing date subject to withholding for various contractual issues, and (iii) 34 thousand shares of our common stock valued at $0.3 million on the closing date. The selling shareholders were also entitled to contingent cash consideration through an earn-out provision based on NSR performance of the acquired firm over the twelve month period following closing. We estimated the fair value of the contingent earn-out liability to be $0.5 million based on the projections and probabilities of reaching the performance goals through July 2014. The earnout goals were not achieved, and the liability was subsequently reversed in fiscal year 2014. Goodwill of $2.2 million, none of which is expected to be tax deductible, and other intangible assets of $2.1 million were recorded as a result of this acquisition. The USS acquisition has been recorded in the Energy operating segment. The impact of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated balance sheets and results of operations.\nOperating Segments\nWe manage our business under the following four operating segments:\nEnergy: The Energy operating segment provides services to a range of clients including energy companies, power utilities, other commercial entities, and state and federal government entities. Our services include program management, engineer/procure/construct projects, design, and consulting. Our typical projects involve upgrades, design and new construction for electric transmission and distribution systems and substations; energy efficiency program design and management; and renewable energy development and power generation.\nEnvironmental: The Environmental operating segment provides services to a wide range of clients including industrial, transportation, energy and natural resource companies, as well as federal, state and municipal agencies. The Environmental operating segment is organized to focus on key areas of demand including: environmental management of buildings and facilities; air quality measurements and modeling of potential air pollution impacts; water quality and water resource management; assessment and remediation of contaminated sites and buildings; hazardous waste management; construction monitoring, inspection and management; environmental, health and safety management and sustainability advisory services; compliance auditing and strategic due diligence; environmental licensing and permitting of a wide variety of projects; and natural and cultural resource assessment, protection and management.\nInfrastructure: The Infrastructure operating segment provides services related to the expansion of infrastructure capacity, and the rehabilitation of overburdened and deteriorating infrastructure systems. Our client base is predominantly state and municipal governments as well as select commercial developers. In addition, we provide infrastructure services on projects originating in our Energy and Environmental operating segments. Primary services include: roadway, bridge and related surface transportation design; structural design and inspection of bridges; program management; construction engineering inspection and construction management for roads and bridges; civil engineering for municipalities and public works departments; geotechnical engineering services; and security assessments, design and construction management.\nPipeline Services: The Pipeline Services operating segment provides pipeline and facilities engineering, EPC/EPCM, field services and integrity services to the oil and gas transmission and midstream markets, as well as at government facilities. We specialize in providing engineering services to assist clients in designing, engineering and constructing or expanding pipeline systems, compressor stations, pump stations, fuel storage facilities, terminals, and field gathering and production facilities. Our expertise extends to the engineering of a wide range of project peripherals, including various types of support buildings and utility systems, power generation and electrical transmission systems, communications systems, fire protection, water and sewage treatment, water transmission, roads and railroad sidings. We also provide project management, engineering and material procurement services to the refining industry and government agencies, including mechanical, civil, structural, electrical instrumentation/controls and environmental engineering. We provide\nfull-service integrity management program offerings including program development, data services, risk analysis, corrosion evaluation, integrity engineering and integrity construction services. We are partnered with Google to provide a cloud-based pipeline life-cycle integrity management solution, Integra Link\u2122, which utilizes Google's geospatial technology platform to help oil and gas pipeline companies visualize and utilize their data and information.\nOur chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"). Our CEO manages the business by evaluating the financial results of the four operating segments, focusing primarily on segment revenue and segment profit. We utilize segment revenue and segment profit because we believe they provide useful information for effectively allocating resources among operating segments; evaluating the health of our operating segments based on metrics that management can actively influence; and gauging our investments and our ability to service, incur or pay down debt. Specifically, our CEO evaluates segment revenue and segment profit and assesses the performance of each operating segment based on these measures, as well as, among other things, the prospects of each of the operating segments and how they fit into our overall strategy. Our CEO then decides how resources should be allocated among our operating segments. We do not track our assets by operating segment, and consequently, it is not practical to show assets by operating segment. Segment profit includes all operating expenses except the following: costs associated with providing corporate shared services (including certain depreciation and amortization), goodwill and intangible asset write-offs, stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation expense is primarily allocated to operating segments based upon their respective use of total operating segment office space. Assets solely used by Corporate are not allocated to the operating segments. Inter-segment balances and transactions are not material. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those for us as a whole except as discussed herein.\nThe following table presents the approximate percentage of our NSR by operating segment:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Infrastructure\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pipeline\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBusiness Trend Analysis\nEnergy: The utilities in the United States are in the midst of a multi-year upgrade of the electric transmission grid to improve capacity, reliability and distribution of sources of generation. Years of underinvestment coupled with a favorable regulatory environment have provided a good business opportunity for those serving this market. According to the Edison Electric Institute, electric utilities throughout the United States will be investing over $60 billion in the performance of this work over the next several years. Economic impacts have slowed the pace of this investment, yet they do not appear to have affected the long term plan of investment. Demand for energy efficiency services continues to be supported by increasing state and federal funds targeted at energy efficiency. The Regional Green House Gas Initiative and system benefit charges at the state or utility level have expanded the marketplace for energy efficiency program management services. Investment within the renewable portfolios also remains strong. We are well established in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions and are growing our presence in the Southeast and in Texas and California where demand for services is the highest.\nEnvironmental: Although there had been signs of growth in this market following a slowdown caused by general economic conditions, market demand for environmental services continues to be mixed. The last decade saw growth in nearly all aspects of this market. The fundamental market drivers remain in place, and this market also benefits from evolving regulatory developments particularly with respect to air quality, and the continuing need to enhance our aging transportation and energy infrastructure. While we expect oil and gas activity and major capital projects to be constrained in the near term, the outlook for services related to other areas of the market, such as environmental remediation, construction, transaction support, the retirement of coal plants and the need to transport natural gas remains favorable. Renewables and other energy source initiatives present important market opportunities but are linked to federal and state policy changes which will be required for the markets to commit long-term capital to projects such as pipelines and related infrastructure.\nInfrastructure: Long-term prospects should be favorable and our backlog is up significantly. The overall infrastructure construction markets are expected to benefit from the federal funding certainty provided by the new $305 billion highway bill known as the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act. The bill calls for the spending of approximately $205 billion on highways and $48 billion on transit projects.\nPipeline Services: Our Pipeline Services segment is currently in the midst of a market downturn due to low oil and gas prices and uncertainty in the oil and gas markets. Nevertheless, long-term opportunities include mid-stream oil and natural gas liquid pipelines which are necessary to match takeaway capacity with levels of production, some of which is stranded due to inadequate pipeline infrastructure, primarily in the Marcellus and Utica shales. Additional future opportunities are presented by natural gas pipelines to take gas to LNG export facilities as well as Mexico and Latin America. Furthermore natural gas pipelines will be required as coal plants are retired and replaced with cleaner gas-burning plants. New regulatory requirements proposed by the Department of Transportation will lead to data and integrity requirements for pipeline operators where our technologies and services can be utilized.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions. We use our best judgment in the assumptions used to compile these estimates, which are based on current facts and circumstances, prior experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are the policies which are most critical in the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations:\nRevenue Recognition-We recognize contract revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Specifically, we follow the guidance in ASC Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts.\nFixed-Price Contracts\nWe recognize revenue on fixed-price contracts using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method of revenue recognition, we estimate the progress towards completion to determine the amount of revenue and profit to recognize on all significant contracts. We generally utilize an efforts-expended, cost-to-cost approach in applying the percentage-of-completion method under which revenue is earned in proportion to total costs incurred divided by total costs expected to be incurred.\nUnder the percentage-of-completion method, recognition of profit is dependent upon the accuracy of a variety of estimates including engineering progress, materials quantities, achievement of milestones and other incentives, liquidated-damages provisions, labor productivity and cost estimates. Such estimates are based on various judgments we make with respect to those factors and can be difficult to accurately determine until the project is significantly underway. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, actual completion costs often vary from estimates. If estimated total costs on any contract indicate a loss, we charge the entire estimated loss to operations in the period the loss first becomes known. If actual costs exceed the original fixed contract price, recognition of any additional revenue will be pursuant to a change order, contract modification, or claim.\nWe have entered into fixed-price Exit Strategy contracts to remediate environmental conditions at contaminated sites. Under most Exit Strategy contracts, the majority of the contract price was deposited by the client into a restricted account with an insurer. The funds in the restricted account are held by the insurer and used to pay us as work is performed. The arrangement with the insurer provides for the deposited funds to earn interest at the one-year constant maturity United States Treasury Bill rate. The interest is recorded when earned and reported as interest income from contractual arrangements on the consolidated statements of operations. On certain Exit Strategy projects, we have taken title to the underlying properties in order to facilitate access, remedial construction, performance of operations monitoring and maintenance activities, and the overall execution of the cleanup. As these properties are distressed, they have no value.\nThe Exit Strategy funds held by the insurer, including any interest thereon, are recorded as an asset (current and long-term restricted investment) on our consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding liability (current and long-term deferred revenue) related to the funds. Consistent with our other fixed-price contracts, we recognize revenue on Exit Strategy contracts using the percentage-of-completion method. When determining the extent of progress towards completion on Exit Strategy contracts, prepaid insurance premiums and fees are amortized, on a straight-line basis, to cost incurred over the life of the related insurance policy. Certain Exit Strategy contracts were classified as pertaining to either remediation or operation, maintenance and monitoring. In addition, certain Exit Strategy contracts were segmented such that the remediation and operation portion of the contract is separately accounted for from the maintenance and monitoring portion.\nUnder most Exit Strategy contracts, additional payments were made by the client to the insurer, typically through an insurance broker, for insurance premiums and fees for a policy to cover potential costs in excess of the original estimates and other factors\nsuch as third party liability. For Exit Strategy contracts where we establish that (1) costs exceed the contract value and interest growth thereon and (2) such costs are covered by insurance, we record an estimated insurance recovery up to the amount of insured costs. An insurance gain, that is, an amount to be recovered in excess of our recorded costs, is not recognized until the receipt of insurance proceeds. Insurance recoveries are reported as insurance recoverables and other income on our consolidated statements of operations. If estimated total costs on any contract indicate a loss, we charge the entire estimated loss to operations in the period the loss first becomes known.\nUnit price contracts are a subset of fixed-price contracts. Under unit price contracts, our clients pay a set fee for each unit of service or production. We recognize revenue under unit price contracts as we complete the related service transaction for our clients. If our costs per service transaction exceed original estimates, our profit margins will decrease, and we may realize a loss on the project unless we can receive payment for the additional costs.\nTime-and-Materials Contracts\nUnder time-and-materials contracts, we negotiate hourly billing rates and charge our clients based on the actual time that we expend on a project. In addition, clients reimburse us for actual out-of-pocket costs of materials and other direct reimbursable expenses that we incur in connection with our performance under the contract. Our profit margins on time-and-materials contracts fluctuate based on actual labor and overhead costs that we directly charge or allocate to contracts compared to negotiated billing rates. Revenue on time-and-materials contracts is recognized based on the actual number of hours we spend on the projects plus any actual out-of-pocket costs of materials and other direct reimbursable expenses that we incur on the projects.\nCost-Plus Contracts\nCost-Plus Fixed Fee Contracts. Under our cost-plus fixed fee contracts, we charge clients for our costs, including both direct and indirect costs, plus a fixed negotiated fee. In negotiating a cost-plus fixed fee contract, we estimate all recoverable direct and indirect costs and then add a fixed profit component. The total estimated cost plus the negotiated fee represents the total contract value. We recognize revenue based on the actual labor and non-labor costs we incur plus the portion of the fixed fee we have earned to date.\nCost-Plus Fixed Rate Contracts. Under our cost-plus fixed rate contracts, we charge clients for our costs plus negotiated rates based on our indirect costs. In negotiating a cost-plus fixed rate contract, we estimate all recoverable direct and indirect costs and then add a profit component, which is a percentage of total recoverable costs, to arrive at a total dollar estimate for the project. We recognize revenue based on the actual total costs we have expended plus the applicable fixed rate. If the actual total costs are lower than the total costs we have estimated, our revenue from that project will be lower than originally estimated.\nChange Orders/Claims\nChange orders are modifications to an original contract that change the provisions of the contract. Change orders typically result from changes in scope, specifications or design, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites, or period of completion of the work. Claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price that we seek to collect from our clients or others for delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders that are either in dispute or are unapproved as to both scope and price, or other causes.\nCosts related to change orders and claims are recognized when they are incurred. Change orders are included in total estimated contract revenue when it is probable that the change order will result in a bona fide addition to contract value and can be reliably estimated. Claims are included in total estimated contract revenues only to the extent that contract costs related to the claims have been incurred and when it is probable that the claim will result in a bona fide addition to contract value which can be reliably estimated. No profit is recognized on claims until final settlement occurs. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we did not recognize any revenue related to claims.\nOther Contract Matters\nFederal Acquisition Regulations (\"FAR\"), which are applicable to our federal government contracts and may be incorporated in many local and state agency contracts, limit the recovery of certain specified indirect costs on contracts. Cost-plus contracts covered by FAR or with certain state and local agencies also require an audit of actual costs and provide for upward or downward adjustments if actual recoverable costs differ from billed recoverable costs. Most of our federal government contracts are subject to termination at the discretion of the client. Contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of such termination.\nContracts with the federal government are subject to audit, primarily by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (\"DCAA\"), which reviews our overhead rates, operating systems and cost proposals. During the course of its audits, the DCAA may disallow costs if it determines that we have accounted for such costs in a manner inconsistent with Cost Accounting Standards or FAR. Our last incurred cost audit was for fiscal year 2004 and resulted in an immaterial adjustment. DCAA determined that an audit of incurred\ncost proposals submitted to DCAA for fiscal years 2005 through 2013 was not required. Historically, we have not had any material cost disallowances by the DCAA as a result of audit, however there can be no assurance that DCAA audits will not result in material cost disallowances in the future.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts-An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our clients to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts has been determined through reviews of specific amounts deemed to be uncollectible and estimated write-offs as a result of clients who have filed for bankruptcy protection plus an allowance for other amounts for which some loss is determined to be probable based on current circumstances. If the financial condition of clients or our assessment as to collectability were to change, adjustments to the allowances may be required.\nIncome Taxes-We are required to estimate the provision for income taxes, including the current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of assets and liabilities for tax and financial accounting purposes. These differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, together with net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards and tax credits are recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. An assessment is required to be made of the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent that we determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred asset will not be utilized, a valuation allowance is established. Taxable income in future periods significantly above or below that projected will cause adjustments to the valuation allowance that could materially decrease or increase future income tax expense.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position"}
