In addition, as portfolio occupancy increases and available inventory of vacant space decreases, we expect our leasing volume to decline as we focus on the merchandising of our properties to ensure the right mix of operators and unique retailers. We continue to anticipate that a large proportion of our new leasing activity will be non-comparable in nature as the leased space is more likely to have been vacant for longer than 12 months.\nCapital Markets\nOn March 12, 2015, we completed a public offering of $250,000 in aggregate principal amount of our 4.00% senior unsecured notes due 2025 (4.00% notes). The 4.00% notes were priced at 99.526% of the principal amount to yield 4.058% to maturity and will mature on March 15, 2025, unless earlier redeemed. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of our unsecured revolving line of credit.\nOn December 21, 2015, we established a new ATM equity program under which we may issue and sell shares of our Class A common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $250,000, from time to time. Actual sales may depend on a variety of factors, including, among others, market conditions and the trading price of our Class A common stock. Any net proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the funding of acquisitions and redevelopment activities and the repayment of debt, including our Unsecured Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2015, we had Class A common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $250,000 remaining available for sale under our ATM equity program.\nOn December 15, 2015, our board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase, from time to time, up to a maximum of $250,000 of shares of our Class A common stock. The shares may be repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price in absolute terms and in relation to the value of our assets, corporate and regulatory requirements, market conditions and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. The common stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. As of December 31, 2015, we had not repurchased any shares under this program.\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we continued to enhance balance sheet flexibility by repaying or defeasing mortgage debt, including certain longer dated maturities, in amounts totaling $495,456 (excluding scheduled principal payments of $16,126 related to amortizing loans). We also borrowed $100,000, net of repayments, on our unsecured revolving line of credit.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2015, we entered into our fourth amended and restated unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions led by KeyBank National Association serving as administrative agent and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association serving as syndication agent to provide for an unsecured credit facility aggregating $1,200,000. Our 2016 unsecured credit facility consists of a $750,000 unsecured revolving line of credit, a $200,000 unsecured term loan and a $250,000 unsecured term loan (collectively, our 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility) and will be priced on a leverage grid at a rate of LIBOR plus a credit spread.

We define NOI as operating revenues (rental income, tenant recovery income and other property income, excluding straight-line rental income, amortization of lease inducements, amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and lease termination fee income) less property operating expenses (real estate tax expense and property operating expense, excluding straight-line ground rent expense, amortization of acquired ground lease intangibles and straight-line bad debt expense). Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to other REITs.\nThis measure provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from operating income or net income attributable to common shareholders as defined within GAAP. We use NOI to evaluate our performance on a property-by-property basis because NOI allows us to evaluate the impact that factors such as lease structure, lease rates and tenant base have on our operating results.\nHowever, NOI should only be used as an alternative measure of our financial performance. For reference and as an aid in understanding our computation of NOI, a reconciliation of NOI to net income attributable to common shareholders as computed in accordance with GAAP has been presented. We include a reconciliation for each comparable period presented.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following table presents NOI for our same store portfolio and Other investment properties\u201d along with a reconciliation to net income attributable to common shareholders.

We elected to early adopt the revised discontinued operations pronouncement effective January 1, 2014. The revised pronouncement limits what qualifies for discontinued operations treatment and requires prospective application to all dispositions or assets classified as held for sale subsequent to adoption. One property, Riverpark Phase IIA, was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2013, and, therefore, qualified for discontinued operations treatment under the previous standard. No additional properties qualified for discontinued operations treatment during the year ended December 31, 2014. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 consists of 20 properties that were sold during the year ended December 31, 2013 and one property classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2013, including 12 multi-tenant retail properties, six single-user retail properties, two single-user office properties and one single-user industrial property. The 2013 dispositions aggregated 2,833,900 square feet for consideration totaling $328,045 during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nFunds From Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders\nThe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a performance measure known as FFO. As defined by NAREIT, FFO means net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable real estate, plus depreciation and amortization and impairment charges on depreciable real estate, including amounts from continuing and discontinued operations, as well as adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures in which the reporting entity holds an interest. We have adopted the NAREIT definition in our computation of FFO attributable to common shareholders. Management believes that, subject to the following limitations, FFO attributable to common shareholders provides a basis for comparing our performance and operations to those of other REITs.\nWe define Operating FFO attributable to common shareholders as FFO attributable to common shareholders excluding the impact of discrete non-operating transactions and other events which we do not consider representative of the comparable operating results of our core business platform, our real estate operating portfolio. Specific examples of discrete non-operating transactions and other events include, but are not limited to, the financial statement impact of gains or losses associated with the early extinguishment of debt or other liabilities, actual or anticipated settlement of litigation involving the Company, executive and realignment separation charges and impairment charges to write down the carrying value of assets other than depreciable real estate, which are otherwise excluded from our calculation of FFO attributable to common shareholders.\nWe believe that FFO attributable to common shareholders and Operating FFO attributable to common shareholders, which are non-GAAP performance measures, provide additional and useful means to assess the operating performance of REITs. Neither FFO attributable to common shareholders nor Operating FFO attributable to common shareholders represent alternatives to Net income\u201d or Net income attributable to common shareholders\u201d as an indicator of our performance or Cash flows from operating activities\u201d as determined by GAAP as a measure of our capacity to fund cash needs, including the payment of dividends.

The loans repaid or defeased during the year ended December 31, 2015 had a weighted average fixed interest rate of 5.82%.\nIn August 2015, the servicing of the Commercial Mortgage-Backed Security (CMBS) loan encumbering The Gateway was transferred to the special servicer at our request. This servicing transfer occurred notwithstanding the fact that the CMBS loan was performing. In 2014, this property was impaired below its debt balance, which was $94,463 as of December 31, 2015. The loan was non-recourse to us, except for customary non-recourse carve-outs. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we disposed of The Gateway through a lender-directed sale in full satisfaction of our mortgage obligation.\nUnsecured Notes Payable\nOn March 12, 2015, we completed a public offering of $250,000 in aggregate principal amount of our 4.00% notes. The 4.00% notes were priced at 99.526% of the principal amount to yield 4.058% to maturity. In addition, on June 30, 2014, we completed a private placement of $250,000 of unsecured notes, consisting of $100,000 of 4.12% Series A senior notes due 2021 and $150,000 of 4.58% Series B senior notes due 2024 (collectively, Series A and B notes). The proceeds from the 4.00% notes and the Series A and B notes were used to repay a portion of our unsecured revolving line of credit.\nThe indenture, as supplemented, governing the 4.00% notes (the Indenture) contains customary covenants and events of default. Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, we are subject to various financial covenants, including the requirement to maintain the following: (i) maximum secured and total leverage ratios; (ii) a debt service coverage ratio; and (iii) maintenance of an unencumbered assets to unsecured debt ratio.\nThe note purchase agreement governing the 4.12% Series A senior notes due 2021 and 4.58% Series B senior notes due 2024 contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, and events of default. Pursuant to the terms of the note purchase agreement, we are subject to various financial covenants, some of which are based upon the financial covenants in effect in our primary credit facility, including the requirement to maintain the following: (i) maximum unencumbered, secured and consolidated leverage ratios; (ii) minimum interest coverage and unencumbered interest coverage ratios; and (iii) a minimum consolidated net worth.\nAs of December 31, 2015, management believes we were in compliance with the financial covenants under the Indenture and the note purchase agreement.\nUnsecured Credit Facility\nIn May 2013, we entered into our third amended and restated unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions to provide for the Unsecured Credit Facility aggregating to $1,000,000, consisting of a $550,000 unsecured revolving line of credit and a $450,000 unsecured term loan. The Unsecured Credit Facility had a $450,000 accordion option that allowed us, at our election, to increase the availability thereunder up to $1,450,000, subject to (i) customary fees and conditions including, but not limited to, the absence of an event of default as defined in the agreement and (ii) our ability to obtain additional lender commitments.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Unsecured Credit Facility was priced on a leverage grid at a rate of LIBOR plus a credit spread. We received investment grade credit ratings from two rating agencies in 2014 and in accordance with the unsecured credit agreement, we may elect to convert to an investment grade pricing grid. As of December 31, 2015, making such an election would have resulted in a higher interest rate and, as such, we did not make the election to convert to an investment grade pricing grid.

As of December 31, 2015, management believes we were in compliance with the financial covenants and default provisions under the unsecured credit agreement.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2015, we entered into our fourth amended and restated unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions led by KeyBank National Association serving as administrative agent and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association serving as syndication agent to provide for an unsecured credit facility aggregating $1,200,000, or our 2016 Unsecured\nCredit Facility.

Distributions in excess of these earnings and profits generally are treated as a non-taxable reduction of the shareholders' basis in the shares to the extent thereof (non-dividend distributions) and thereafter as taxable gain. We intend to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Code generally requires that a REIT annually distributes to its shareholders at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains. The Code imposes tax on any undistributed REIT taxable income.\nTo satisfy the requirements for qualification as a REIT and generally not be subject to U.S. federal income and excise tax, we intend to make regular quarterly distributions of all, or substantially all, of our taxable income to shareholders. Our future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors. When determining the amount of future distributions, we expect that our board of directors will consider, among other factors, (i) the amount of cash generated from our operating activities, (ii) our expectations of future cash flow, (iii) our determination of near-term cash needs for debt repayments, acquisitions of new properties, redevelopment opportunities and existing or future share repurchases, (iv) the timing of significant re-leasing activities and the establishment of additional cash reserves for anticipated tenant allowances and general property capital improvements, (v) our ability to continue to access additional sources of capital, (vi) the amount required to be distributed to maintain our status as a REIT and to reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, (vii) the amount required to declare and pay in cash, or set aside for the payment of, the dividends on our Series A preferred stock for all past dividend periods, (viii) any limitations on our distributions contained in our Unsecured Credit Facility, which, as of December 31, 2015, limited our distributions to the greater of 95% of FFO, as defined in the unsecured credit agreement (which equals FFO attributable to common shareholders, as set forth in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders,\u201d excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items, impairment charges not already excluded from FFO attributable to common shareholders and other non-cash charges) or the amount necessary for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we entered into our fourth amended and restated unsecured credit agreement, which does not include a similar limitation on our distributions though it does require us to distribute at least an amount necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to make distributions in excess of cash available for distribution in order to meet the REIT distribution requirements.\nIn March 2013, we established an at-the-market (ATM) equity program under which we sold 5,547 shares of our Class A common stock during the year ended December 31, 2013. The shares were issued at a weighted average price per share of $15.29 for proceeds of $83,527, net of commissions and offering costs. No shares were issued during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 and the 2013 ATM equity program expired in November 2015.\nIn December 2015, we established a new ATM equity program under which we may issue and sell shares of our Class A common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $250,000, from time to time. Actual sales may depend on a variety of factors, including, among others, market conditions and the trading price of our Class A common stock. Any net proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the funding of acquisitions and redevelopment activities and the repayment of debt, including our Unsecured Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2015, we had Class A common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $250,000 remaining available for sale under our ATM equity program.\nIn December 2015, our board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase, from time to time, up to a maximum of $250,000 of shares of our Class A common stock. The shares may be repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price in absolute terms and in relation to the value of our assets, corporate and regulatory requirements, market conditions and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. The common stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. As of December 31, 2015, we had not repurchased any shares under this program.\nCapital Expenditures and Development Activity\nWe anticipate that obligations related to capital improvements to our properties can be met with cash flows from operations and working capital.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we owned one development property, South Billings Center located in Billings, Montana, with a carrying value of $5,157 which is not under active development.\nDispositions\nWe continue to execute our long-term portfolio repositioning strategy of disposing of select non-target and single-user properties in order to facilitate our external growth initiatives.

Net cash used in financing activities in 2015 increased $74,157 primarily due to the following:\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $249,246 increase in principal payments on mortgages payable; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an $81,283 increase in purchases of U.S. Treasury securities in connection with defeasance of mortgages payable;\n</td> </tr>\n</table> partially offset by\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $265,000 increase in net proceeds from our Unsecured Credit Facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe plan to continue to address our debt maturities through a combination of proceeds from asset dispositions, capital markets transactions and our unsecured revolving line of credit.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe table below presents our obligations and commitments to make future payments under our debt obligations and lease agreements as of December 31, 2015 and does not reflect the impact of any 2016 activity, such as our 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility:\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nyears (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (a):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>630,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>446,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>802,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,928,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>455,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>510,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>554,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,055,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>566,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,407,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,188,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Amounts exclude mortgage premium of $1,865, mortgage discount of $(1), unsecured notes payable discount of $(1,090) and capitalized loan fees of $(13,041), net of accumulated amortization, as of December 31, 2015.

We lease office space under non-cancellable leases expiring in various years from 2016 to 2023.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. For example, significant estimates and assumptions have been made with respect to useful lives of assets; capitalization of development costs; fair value measurements; provision for impairment, including estimates of holding periods, capitalization rates and discount rates (where applicable); provision for income taxes; recoverable amounts of receivables; deferred taxes and initial valuations and related amortization periods of deferred costs and intangibles, particularly with respect to property acquisitions. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe following disclosure pertains to accounting policies and estimates we believe are most critical\u201d to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. These judgments often result from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. GAAP requires information in financial statements about accounting principles, methods used and disclosures pertaining to significant estimates. This discussion addresses our judgment pertaining to known trends, events or uncertainties which were taken into consideration upon the application of those policies and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported upon taking into consideration different conditions and assumptions.\nAcquisition of Investment Property\nWe allocate the purchase price of each acquired investment property based upon the estimated acquisition date fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which generally include land, building and other improvements, in-place lease value, acquired above and below market lease intangibles, any assumed financing that is determined to be above or below market, the value of customer relationships and goodwill, if any. Acquisition transaction costs are expensed as incurred and included within General and administrative expenses\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income.\nFor tangible assets acquired, including land, building and other improvements, we consider available comparable market and industry information in estimating the acquisition date fair value. We allocate a portion of the purchase price to the estimated acquired in-place lease value intangibles based on estimated lease execution costs for similar leases as well as lost rental payments during an assumed lease-up period. We also evaluate each acquired lease as compared to current market rates. If an acquired lease is determined to be above or below market, we allocate a portion of the purchase price to such above or below market leases based upon the present value of the difference between the contractual lease payments and estimated market rent payments over the remaining lease term. Renewal periods are included within the lease term in the calculation of above and below market lease intangibles if, based upon factors known at the acquisition date, market participants would consider it reasonably assured that the lessee would exercise such options. Acquisition accounting fair value estimates, including the discount rate used, require us to consider various factors, including, but not limited to, market knowledge, demographics, age and physical condition of the property, geographic location, size and location of tenant spaces within the acquired investment property and tenant profile.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nOur investment properties, including developments in progress, are reviewed for potential impairment at the end of each reporting period or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. At the end of each reporting period, we separately determine whether impairment indicators exist for each property. Examples of situations considered to be impairment indicators for both operating properties and developments in progress include, but are not limited to:\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a substantial decline in or continued low occupancy rate or cash flow;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expected significant declines in occupancy in the near future;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>continued difficulty in leasing space;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a significant concentration of financially troubled tenants;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a change in anticipated holding period;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a cost accumulation or delay in project completion date significantly above and beyond the original development or redevelopment estimate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a significant decrease in market price not in line with general market trends; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>any other quantitative or qualitative events or factors deemed significant by our management or board of directors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> If the presence of one or more impairment indicators as described above is identified at the end of a reporting period or at any point throughout the year with respect to a property, the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing its carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. An investment property is considered to be impaired when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than its current carrying value. When performing a test for recoverability or estimating the fair value of an impaired investment property, we make certain complex or subjective assumptions which include, but are not limited to:\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>projected operating cash flows considering factors such as vacancy rates, rental rates, lease terms, tenant financial strength, competitive positioning and property location;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>estimated holding period or various potential holding periods when considering probability-weighted scenarios;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>projected capital expenditures and lease origination costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>estimated interest and internal costs expected to be capitalized, dates of construction completion and grand opening dates for developments in progress;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>projected cash flows from the eventual disposition of an operating property or development in progress using a property-specific capitalization rate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>comparable selling prices; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a property-specific discount rate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We did not have any unconsolidated joint ventures as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. When we hold investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, they are reviewed for potential impairment, in addition to impairment evaluations of the individual assets underlying these investments, each reporting period or whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant such an evaluation.\nTo determine whether any identified impairment is other-than-temporary, we consider whether we have the ability and intent to hold the investment until the carrying value is fully recovered. To the extent impairment has occurred, we will record an impairment charge calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value.\nCost Capitalization, Depreciation and Amortization Policies\nOur policy is to review all expenses paid and capitalize any items which are deemed to be an upgrade or a tenant improvement. These costs are included in the investment properties financial statement caption as an addition to building and other improvements.\nDepreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method. Building and other improvements are depreciated based upon estimated useful lives of 30 years for building and associated improvements and 15 years for site improvements and most other capital improvements. Tenant improvements, leasing fees and acquired in-place lease value intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the related lease as a component of depreciation and amortization expense. Acquired above and below market lease intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the related lease, inclusive of renewal periods if market participants would consider it reasonably assured that the lessee would exercise such options, as an adjustment to rental income when we are the lessor. For acquired leases in which we are the lessee, any value attributable to above and below market lease intangibles is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the related lease as an adjustment to property operating expenses.\nDevelopment and Redevelopment Projects\nDuring the development or redevelopment period, we capitalize direct project costs such as construction, insurance, architectural and legal, as well as certain indirect project costs such as interest, other financing costs, real estate taxes and internal salaries and related benefits of personnel directly involved in the project. Capitalization of the indirect project costs ceases and all project-related costs included in developments in progress are reclassified to land and building and other improvements at the time when development or redevelopment is considered substantially complete. Additionally, we make estimates as to the probability of completion of development and redevelopment projects. If we determine that completion of the development or redevelopment project is no longer probable, we expense any capitalized costs that are not recoverable.\nA project's classification changes from development to operating when it is substantially completed and held available for occupancy, but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity. A property is considered stabilized upon reaching 90% occupancy, but no later than one year from the date it was classified as operating, and is included in our same store portfolio when it is stabilized for the periods presented.\nInvestment Properties Held for Sale\nIn determining whether to classify an investment property as held for sale, we consider whether: (i) management has committed to a plan to sell the investment property; (ii) the investment property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary; (iii) we have initiated a program to locate a buyer; (iv) we believe that the sale of the investment property is probable; (v) we are actively marketing the investment property for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current value, and (vi) actions required for us to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that any significant changes will be made.\nIf all of the above criteria are met, we classify the investment property as held for sale. When these criteria are met, we suspend depreciation (including depreciation for building improvements and tenant improvements) and amortization of acquired in-place lease value intangibles and any above or below market lease intangibles and we record the investment property held for sale at\nthe lower of cost or net realizable value. The assets and liabilities associated with those investment properties that are classified as held for sale are presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets for the most recent reporting period. Prior to our adoption of the revised discontinued operations pronouncement in 2014, if the operations and cash flow of the property had been, or were upon consummation of such sale, eliminated from ongoing operations and we did not have significant continuing involvement in the operations of the property, then the operations for the periods presented were classified in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income as discontinued operations for all periods presented. However, the revised discontinued operations pronouncement, which we early adopted effective January 1, 2014, limits what qualifies for discontinued operations presentation. As a result, the investment properties that were sold or classified as held for sale during 2015 and 2014, except for Riverpark Phase IIA, which was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2013 and, therefore, qualified for discontinued operations treatment under the previous standard, did not qualify for discontinued operations presentation and, as such, are reflected in continuing operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe commence revenue recognition on our leases based on a number of factors. In most cases, revenue recognition under a lease begins when the lessee takes possession of or controls the physical use of the leased asset. Generally, this occurs on the lease commencement date. The determination of who is the owner, for accounting purposes, of the tenant improvements determines the nature of the leased asset and when revenue recognition under a lease begins. If we are the owner, for accounting purposes, of the tenant improvements, then the leased asset is the finished space and revenue recognition begins when the lessee takes possession of the finished space, typically when the improvements are substantially complete. If we conclude that the lessee is the owner, for accounting purposes, of the tenant improvements, then the leased asset is the unimproved space and any tenant improvement allowances funded under the lease are accounted for as lease inducements which are amortized as a reduction to the revenue recognized over the term of the lease. In these circumstances, we commence revenue recognition when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space for the lessee to construct their own improvements. We consider a number of factors to evaluate whether we or the lessee are the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes. These factors include:\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the uniqueness of the improvements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the expected economic life of the tenant improvements relative to the length of the lease;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>who constructs or directs the construction of the improvements, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether the tenant or landlord is obligated to fund cost overruns.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The determination of who owns the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, is subject to significant judgment. In making that determination, we consider all of the above factors. No one factor, however, necessarily establishes its determination.\nRental income, for only those leases that have fixed and measurable rent escalations, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of each lease. The difference between such rental income earned and the cash rent due under the provisions of a lease is recorded as deferred rent receivable and is included as a component of Accounts and notes receivable\u201d in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nReimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses are accrued as revenue in the period the applicable expenditures are incurred. We make certain assumptions and judgments in estimating the reimbursements at the end of each reporting period.\nWe record lease termination income in Other property income\u201d upon: (i) execution of a termination letter agreement; (ii) when all of the conditions of such agreement have been fulfilled; (iii) the tenant is no longer occupying the property and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. Upon early lease termination, we may record losses related to recognized tenant specific intangibles and other assets or adjust the remaining useful life of the assets if determined to be appropriate.\nOur policy for percentage rental income is to defer recognition of contingent rental income until the specified target (i.e. breakpoint) that triggers the contingent rental income is achieved.\nProfits from sales of real estate are not recognized under the full accrual method unless: (i) a sale is consummated; (ii) the buyer's initial and continuing investments are adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property; (iii) our receivable, if applicable, is not subject to future subordination; (iv) we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership, and (v) we do not have substantial continuing involvement with the property.\nAccounts and Notes Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts and notes receivable balances outstanding include base rents, tenant reimbursements and deferred rent receivables. An allowance for the uncollectible portion of accounts receivable is determined on a tenant-specific basis through an analysis of balances outstanding, historical bad debt levels, tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends. Additionally, estimates of the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims with respect to tenants in bankruptcy are considered in assessing the collectibility of the related receivables. As these factors change, the allowance is subject to revision and may impact our results of operations. Management's estimate of the collectibility of accounts and notes receivable is based on the best information available to management at the time of evaluation.\nIncome Taxes\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the taxable income we currently distribute to our shareholders.\nWe record a benefit, based on the GAAP measurement criteria, for uncertain income tax positions if the result of a tax position meets a more likely than not\u201d recognition threshold.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nEffective January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted, the concept of extraordinary items is eliminated from GAAP and entities are no longer required to consider whether an underlying event or transaction is extraordinary. However, the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently is retained. We elected to early adopt this pronouncement effective January 1, 2015. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nEffective January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted, companies are required to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability, excluding revolving debt arrangements, as a direct reduction of the carrying amount of that debt liability on the balance sheet. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs is not affected. We elected to early adopt this pronouncement effective December 31, 2015. This pronouncement requires a full retrospective method of adoption and the adoption resulted in the reclassification of $15,730 of unamortized capitalized loan fees as of December 31, 2014 from Other assets\u201d to direct reductions of our indebtedness on the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the adoption resulted in the reclassification of $141 of unamortized capitalized loan fees from Assets associated with investment properties held for sale\u201d to Liabilities associated with investment properties held for sale, net.\u201d Unamortized capitalized loan fees attributable to our unsecured revolving line of credit continue to be recorded in Other assets\u201d as they relate to a revolving debt arrangement.\nEffective January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted, a company's management is required to assess the entity's ability to continue as a going concern every reporting period, including interim periods, for a period of one year after the date the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued) and provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The adoption of this pronouncement on January 1, 2016 will not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nEffective January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted, companies are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities under a revised consolidation model. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model, which modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships, and provides a scope exception from consolidation guidance for registered money market funds. This pronouncement allows either a full or a modified retrospective method of adoption. The adoption of this pronouncement on January 1, 2016 under the modified retrospective method will not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nEffective January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted, the acquirer in a business combination is required to recognize any adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined and is no longer required to retrospectively account for those adjustments. A company must present\nseparately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The adoption of this pronouncement on January 1, 2016 will not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nEffective January 1, 2017, registrants will be required to disclose the following in any annual report, proxy or information statement, or registration statement that requires executive compensation disclosure: 1) the median of the annual total compensation of all its employees (excluding the chief executive officer), 2) the annual total compensation of its chief executive officer, and 3) the ratio of the median of the annual total compensation of all its employees to the annual total compensation of its chief executive officer. We do not expect the adoption of this final rule will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nEffective January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted beginning January 1, 2017, companies will be required to apply a five-step model in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The core principle of this revised revenue model is that a company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Lease contracts will be excluded from this revenue recognition criteria; however, the sale of real estate will be required to follow the new model. This pronouncement allows either a full or a modified retrospective method of adoption. Expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding revenue recognition will be required for contracts that are subject to this guidance. We do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements; however, we will continue to evaluate this assessment until the guidance becomes effective.\nInflation\nCertain of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants' gross sales above predetermined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. While most escalation clauses are fixed in nature, some may include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. In addition, many of our leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits us to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal. Most of our leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.\nSubsequent Events\nSubsequent to December 31, 2015, we:\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>entered into our fourth amended and restated unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions to provide for an unsecured credit facility aggregating $1,200,000.

We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as required by applicable law.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report.\nExecutive Summary\nRetail Properties of America, Inc. is a REIT and is one of the largest owners and operators of high quality, strategically located shopping centers in the United States. As of December 31, 2015, we owned 198 retail operating properties representing 28,930,000 square feet of GLA. Our retail operating portfolio includes (i) power centers, (ii) neighborhood and community centers, and (iii) lifestyle centers and multi-tenant retail-focused mixed-use properties, as well as single-user retail properties.\nThe following table summarizes our operating portfolio as of December 31, 2015:\n\n (a) Includes leases signed but not commenced.  In addition to our operating portfolio, we owned one development property that was not under active development as of December 31, 2015.\n2015 Company Highlights\nAcquisitions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we continued to execute our investment strategy by acquiring eight multi-tenant retail operating properties and three parcels at existing wholly-owned multi-tenant retail operating properties for a total purchase price of $463,136.\nThe following table summarizes our 2015 acquisitions:\n\n (a) We acquired a parcel located at our Lake Worth Towne Crossing multi-tenant retail operating property and a single-user outparcel located at our Royal Oaks Village II multi-tenant retail operating property. \n (b) We acquired a single-user outparcel located at our Southlake Town Square multi-tenant retail operating property that was subject to a ground lease with us (as lessor) prior to the transaction.  Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we acquired two multi-tenant retail assets aggregating 251,200 square feet for a total purchase price of $72,231. In total for 2016, we expect to acquire approximately $375,000 to $475,000 of strategic acquisitions in our target markets.\nDispositions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we continued to pursue targeted dispositions of select non-target and single-user properties. Consideration from dispositions totaled $516,444 and included the sale of 16 multi-tenant retail operating properties, five single-user office properties, three single-user retail properties and two development properties, one of which had been held in a consolidated joint venture.\nThe following table summarizes our 2015 dispositions:\n\n (a) The terms of the disposition of Trenton Crossing and McAllen Shopping Center were negotiated as a single transaction. \n (b) The development property had been held in a consolidated joint venture and was sold to an affiliate of the joint venture partner. Concurrent with the sale, the joint venture was dissolved.  Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we sold two multi-tenant retail operating properties aggregating 765,800 square feet for total consideration of $92,500, including The Gateway which was disposed of through a lender-directed sale in full satisfaction of our mortgage obligation. During 2016, we expect targeted dispositions to be approximately $525,000 to $625,000.\nMarket Summary\nAs a result of our capital recycling efforts over the past several years, we increased the amount of ABR in our target markets to more than 60% of our total multi-tenant retail ABR. The following table summarizes our operating portfolio by market as of December 31, 2015:\n\nLeasing Activity\nThe following table summarizes the leasing activity in our retail operating portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2015. Leases with terms of less than 12 months have been excluded from the table.\n\n (a) Total excludes the impact of Non-Comparable New and Renewal Leases. \n (b) Includes leases signed on units that were vacant for over 12 months, leases signed without fixed rental payments and leases signed where the previous and the current lease do not have a consistent lease structure.  We expect modest increases in occupancy in 2016, with the majority of expected leasing activity attributable to small shop tenants. In addition, as portfolio occupancy increases and available inventory of vacant space decreases, we expect our leasing volume to decline as we focus on the merchandising of our properties to ensure the right mix of operators and unique retailers. We continue to anticipate that a large proportion of our new leasing activity will be non-comparable in nature as the leased space is more likely to have been vacant for longer than 12 months.\nCapital Markets\nOn March 12, 2015, we completed a public offering of $250,000 in aggregate principal amount of our 4.00% senior unsecured notes due 2025 (4.00% notes). The 4.00% notes were priced at 99.526% of the principal amount to yield 4.058% to maturity and will mature on March 15, 2025, unless earlier redeemed. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of our unsecured revolving line of credit.\nOn December 21, 2015, we established a new ATM equity program under which we may issue and sell shares of our Class A common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $250,000, from time to time. Actual sales may depend on a variety of factors, including, among others, market conditions and the trading price of our Class A common stock. Any net proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the funding of acquisitions and redevelopment activities and the repayment of debt, including our Unsecured Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2015, we had Class A common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $250,000 remaining available for sale under our ATM equity program.\nOn December 15, 2015, our board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase, from time to time, up to a maximum of $250,000 of shares of our Class A common stock. The shares may be repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price in absolute terms and in relation to the value of our assets, corporate and regulatory requirements, market conditions and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. The common stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. As of December 31, 2015, we had not repurchased any shares under this program.\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we continued to enhance balance sheet flexibility by repaying or defeasing mortgage debt, including certain longer dated maturities, in amounts totaling $495,456 (excluding scheduled principal payments of $16,126 related to amortizing loans). We also borrowed $100,000, net of repayments, on our unsecured revolving line of credit.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2015, we entered into our fourth amended and restated unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions led by KeyBank National Association serving as administrative agent and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association serving as syndication agent to provide for an unsecured credit facility aggregating $1,200,000. Our 2016 unsecured credit facility consists of a $750,000 unsecured revolving line of credit, a $200,000 unsecured term loan and a $250,000 unsecured term loan (collectively, our 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility) and will be priced on a leverage grid at a rate of LIBOR plus a credit spread. The following table summarizes the key terms of our 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility:\n\nOur 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility has a $400,000 accordion option that allows us, at our election, to increase the total credit facility up to $1,600,000, subject to (i) customary fees and conditions including, but not limited to, the absence of an event of default as defined in the agreement and (ii) our ability to obtain additional lender commitments.\nDistributions\nWe declared quarterly distributions totaling $1.75 per share of preferred stock and quarterly distributions totaling $0.6625 per share of common stock during 2015.\nResults of Operations\nWe believe that net operating income (NOI) is a useful measure of our operating performance. We define NOI as operating revenues (rental income, tenant recovery income and other property income, excluding straight-line rental income, amortization of lease inducements, amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and lease termination fee income) less property operating expenses (real estate tax expense and property operating expense, excluding straight-line ground rent expense, amortization of acquired ground lease intangibles and straight-line bad debt expense). Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

We expect modest increases in occupancy in 2016, with the majority of expected leasing activity attributable to small shop tenants. In addition, as portfolio occupancy increases and available inventory of vacant space decreases, we expect our leasing volume to decline as we focus on the merchandising of our properties to ensure the right mix of operators and unique retailers. We continue to anticipate that a large proportion of our new leasing activity will be non-comparable in nature as the leased space is more likely to have been vacant for longer than 12 months.\nCapital Markets\nOn March 12, 2015, we completed a public offering of $250,000 in aggregate principal amount of our 4.00% senior unsecured notes due 2025 (4.00% notes). The 4.00% notes were priced at 99.526% of the principal amount to yield 4.058% to maturity and will mature on March 15, 2025, unless earlier redeemed. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of our unsecured revolving line of credit.\nOn December 21, 2015, we established a new ATM equity program under which we may issue and sell shares of our Class A common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $250,000, from time to time. Actual sales may depend on a variety of factors, including, among others, market conditions and the trading price of our Class A common stock. Any net proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the funding of acquisitions and redevelopment activities and the repayment of debt, including our Unsecured Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2015, we had Class A common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $250,000 remaining available for sale under our ATM equity program.\nOn December 15, 2015, our board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase, from time to time, up to a maximum of $250,000 of shares of our Class A common stock. The shares may be repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price in absolute terms and in relation to the value of our assets, corporate and regulatory requirements, market conditions and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. The common stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. As of December 31, 2015, we had not repurchased any shares under this program.\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we continued to enhance balance sheet flexibility by repaying or defeasing mortgage debt, including certain longer dated maturities, in amounts totaling $495,456 (excluding scheduled principal payments of $16,126 related to amortizing loans). We also borrowed $100,000, net of repayments, on our unsecured revolving line of credit.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2015, we entered into our fourth amended and restated unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions led by KeyBank National Association serving as administrative agent and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association serving as syndication agent to provide for an unsecured credit facility aggregating $1,200,000. Our 2016 unsecured credit facility consists of a $750,000 unsecured revolving line of credit, a $200,000 unsecured term loan and a $250,000 unsecured term loan (collectively, our 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility) and will be priced on a leverage grid at a rate of LIBOR plus a credit spread.

We define NOI as operating revenues (rental income, tenant recovery income and other property income, excluding straight-line rental income, amortization of lease inducements, amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and lease termination fee income) less property operating expenses (real estate tax expense and property operating expense, excluding straight-line ground rent expense, amortization of acquired ground lease intangibles and straight-line bad debt expense). Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not"}
