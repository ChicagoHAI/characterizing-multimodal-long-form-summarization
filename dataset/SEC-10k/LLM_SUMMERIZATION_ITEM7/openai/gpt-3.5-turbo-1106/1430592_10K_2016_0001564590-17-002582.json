We help individuals, either online or with an advisor, develop a strategy to reach investing and retirement goals by offering a comprehensive set of services, including holistic, personalized plans for saving and investing, assessments of retirement income, and the option to meet face-to-face with a dedicated financial advisor at one of more than 130 advisor centers nationwide. Our advice and planning services cover employer-sponsored defined contribution (DC) accounts (401(k), 457, and 403(b) plans), IRA accounts, and taxable accounts.\nWe use our proprietary advice technology platform to provide our services to millions of DC plan participants in the workplace and individuals outside of the workplace on a cost-efficient basis. We believe that our services have significantly increased the accessibility to plan participants of low-cost, high-quality, independent, personalized portfolio management services, investment advice and retirement income planning.\nOur business model is based primarily on providing advisory services to DC plan participants in the workplace. We also provide advisory services directly to individual clients outside of the workplace. Clients are defined as individuals who utilize our services, including Professional Management, Personal Advisor, Online Advice, education or guidance. We work with three key constituencies: individual investors, plan sponsors (employers offering DC plans to their employees) and plan providers (companies providing administrative services to plan sponsors).\nWe maintain two types of relationships with DC plan providers. In direct advisory relationships, we are the primary advisor and a plan fiduciary. In subadvisory relationships, the plan provider (or its affiliate) is the primary advisor and plan fiduciary, and we act in a subadvisory capacity.\nIn February 2016, we completed the acquisition of Kansas City 727 Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability corporation, as well as its subsidiaries and certain affiliates, and also completed the acquisition of all franchises during the period April 2016 to October 2016 (collectively, The Mutual Fund Store\u201d).\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue through three primary sources: professional management, platform and other revenue.\nProfessional Management Revenue\nWe derive professional management revenue from client fees paid by or on behalf of both DC and individual investor clients who are enrolled in one of our discretionary portfolio management services (either the Professional Management service or the Personal Advisor service) for the management of their account assets. We continue to use the term professional management revenue to include revenue from both the Professional Management and Personal Advisor services. Our Professional Management service is a discretionary personalized portfolio management service for DC participants who want to work with or delegate the management of their retirement accounts to a professional with the help of an advisor team. Personal Advisor is a personalized service that can provide discretionary portfolio management on a client's 401(k), IRA and/or taxable assets, as well as comprehensive financial planning and a dedicated advisor representative that participants can meet with in person, online or by phone. Our retirement income solutions, including Income+ and Retirement Paycheck, which are features of our Professional Management and Personal Advisor services, respectively, provide clients approaching or in retirement with discretionary portfolio management with an income objective and steady monthly payments from their accounts during retirement, including Social Security claiming guidance and planning. The Professional Management service is generally made available to prospective clients by written agreements with the plan provider, the plan sponsor and the plan participant in a DC plan (and may be provided on a subadvisory basis); and the Personal Advisor service is generally made available by written agreements with individual investors for the Personal Advisor service.\nOur arrangements with clients using discretionary portfolio management services generally provide for fees based on the value of assets we manage and are generally payable quarterly in arrears. The majority of our client fees across both services, as well as across both advisory and subadvisory relationships for DC accounts, are calculated on a monthly basis, as the product of client fee rates and the value of assets under management (AUM) at or near the end of each month. In general, we expect this monthly methodology to reduce the impact of financial market volatility on this portion of our professional management revenue, although this methodology may result in lower client fees if the financial markets are down when client fees are calculated, even if the market had performed well earlier in the month or the quarter. For IRA and taxable accounts, our client fees are calculated on a quarterly basis at the end of each quarter. In general, we expect this quarterly methodology to potentially result in greater impact of financial market volatility on this portion of our professional management revenue and may result in lower client fees if the financial markets are down when client fees are calculated, even if the market had performed well earlier in the month or the quarter.\nPursuant to the contracts with our clients, we calculate the fees billed to clients based on the asset amounts in data files as received directly from the account provider or custodian, with no judgments or estimates on our part. None of our professional management fee revenue is based on investment performance or other incentive arrangements. Our fees generally are based on AUM, which is influenced by market performance. Our fees are not based on a share of the capital gains or appreciation in a client's account. In some cases, our client fees or the applicable fee schedule may adjust downward based on overall participant or DC AUM enrollment performance milestones over time. Our client fees are determined by the value of the assets in the client's account at specified dates and are recognized as the services are performed.\nIn order to encourage utilization of our Professional Management service, we use a variety of promotional and communication techniques, some of which can potentially impact the amount of revenue recognized, the timing of revenue recognition or both. Historically, we have seen a general preference from workplace plan sponsors to commence campaigns in the second and third quarters of the year and we expect this trend to continue. We would generally expect our professional management revenue to continue to increase as a percentage of overall revenue, which will cause our revenue to become increasingly more sensitive to market performance.\nProfessional management revenue is earned as services are performed. We use estimates primarily related to the portion of professional management revenue that has not been invoiced and is not otherwise due from the customer at period end.\nProfessional Management Revenue Metrics\nAUM is defined as the amount of assets that we manage as part of our discretionary portfolio management services, including assets managed through franchises during the period of February 2016 to October 2016. Our AUM is the value of assets under management as reported by plan providers and custodians at or near the end of each month or quarter.\nDC AUM is the DC asset balances associated with clients enrolled in the Professional Management service, including those at plan sponsors where enrollment campaigns are not yet concluded or have not yet commenced, as of a specified date. We measure enrollment in our Professional Management service by DC clients as a percentage of eligible DC prospective clients and by DC AUM as a percentage of defined contribution account Assets Under Contract (DC AUC). IRA and taxable account AUM represent the IRA and taxable account asset balances associated with those clients enrolled in the Personal Advisor service as of a specified date.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $127.7 billion of DC AUM and $10.3 billion of IRA and taxable account AUM associated with approximately 1,012,000 total clients.\nDC AUC is defined as the amount of assets in DC plans under contract for which the Professional Management service has been made available to eligible prospective clients in the workplace. Our DC AUC and eligible prospective clients do not include assets or prospective clients in DC plans where we have signed contracts but for which we have not yet made the Professional Management service available.\nEligible prospective clients and DC AUC are reported by plan providers with varying frequency and at different points in time, and are not always updated or marked to market. If markets have declined or if assets have left the plan since the reporting date, our DC AUC may be overstated. If markets have risen, or if assets have been added to the plan, since the reporting date, our DC AUC may be understated. Some prospective clients may not be eligible for our services due to plan sponsor limitations on employees treated as insiders for purposes of securities laws or other characteristics of the prospective client. Certain securities within a plan prospective client's account may be ineligible for management by us, such as employer stock subject to trading restrictions, and we do not manage or charge a fee for that portion of the account. In both of these circumstances, assets of the relevant prospective clients may be included in DC AUC but cannot be converted to DC AUM. We believe that DC AUC can be a useful indicator of the additional DC plan assets available for enrollment efforts that, if successful, would result in these assets becoming DC AUM. We believe that total eligible prospective clients provides a useful approximation of the number of workplace-based prospective clients available for enrollment into our Professional Management service.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.05 trillion of DC AUC and 9.4 million prospective clients in DC plans for which the Professional Management service is available, which includes approximately $450 billion of DC AUC and 4.1 million prospective clients in DC plans at 205 plan sponsors for which Income+ has been made available to prospective clients.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had 382 Income+ plan sponsor contracts, including the aforementioned 205 plan sponsors where Income+ has been made available to prospective clients and 177 plan sponsors for which the Professional Management service has not yet been made available, representing a total of approximately $596 billion of DC AUC and 5.6 million prospective clients.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 10.3% of DC eligible prospective clients were enrolled as clients and 12.1% of DC AUC was enrolled as DC AUM.\nChanges in AUM\nThe following definitions are provided and relate to the table below, illustrating estimated changes in our AUM over the last four quarters.\nNew assets from new clients represents the aggregate amount of new AUM, measured at or near the end of the quarter, from new clients who enrolled in one of our discretionary portfolio management services within the quarter. We receive DC account balances for each new client at least weekly, and accordingly, we are generally able to measure the DC account asset balances within a week of the end of the quarter for new clients. For new clients with new IRA and taxable accounts assets, we are generally able to measure the account balances as of the last day of the quarter. New client assets for IRA and taxable accounts are those assets acquired within a ninety-day period after enrollment during which assets may be rolled into those accounts, and new client assets acquired in the subsequent quarter after enrollment are valued as of the last day of that subsequent quarter.\nNew assets from existing clients represents the aggregate amount of new AUM within the quarter from existing clients who originally enrolled in one of our discretionary portfolio management services during a prior period. These new assets include employer and employee contributions into DC plan accounts, as well as assets added by existing clients into new or existing IRA and taxable accounts. Employer and employee DC contributions data is estimated each quarter from annual contribution rates based on data received from plan providers or plan sponsors. Typically, we receive data from plan providers or plan sponsors via weekly client files, allowing us to estimate contributions for those clients for whom we have received this data. After the first 90 days, new clients become existing clients. For new IRA and taxable account assets, we are generally able to measure the new assets from existing clients as of the date the additional assets are deposited.\nVoluntary cancellations represent the aggregate amount of assets, measured at or near the start of the quarter, for clients who have voluntarily terminated their discretionary portfolio management service relationship within the period. Clients may cancel at any time without any requirement to provide advance notice. Our quarter-end AUM excludes all of the assets of any accounts cancelled by a client prior to the end of the last day of the quarter. We receive DC account balances for each client at least weekly, and accordingly, we are able to measure the DC account asset balances within a week of the start of the quarter for existing clients. For existing IRA and taxable accounts assets, we are able to measure the account balances as of the first day of the quarter.\nInvoluntary cancellations represent the aggregate amount of DC assets, measured at or near the start of the quarter, for clients whose Professional Management service relationship was terminated within the period for reasons other than a voluntary termination. Such cancellations may occur when all of the client's account balances have been reduced to zero or when the cancellation of a plan sponsor contract for the Professional Management service has become effective within the period. Plan sponsors may cancel their contract for the provision of Professional Management services upon specified notice or without notice for fiduciary reasons or breach of contract. If a plan sponsor has provided advance notice of cancellation of the plan sponsor contract, however, the AUM for clients of that plan sponsor is included in our AUM until the effective date of the cancellation, which is typically the business day following the termination date, after which it is no longer part of our AUM. If a client's accounts value falls to zero, either upon the effective date of a sponsor cancellation or as a result of the client transferring the entire balance of their accounts, we will terminate their Professional Management service relationship.\nAssets withdrawn by existing clients includes voluntary withdrawals from IRA and taxable accounts. Voluntary withdrawals represent the aggregate amount of assets, measured at the time of withdrawal, for clients who took automatic distributions or who otherwise withdrew funds from their managed IRA or taxable accounts without terminating their service relationship within the period.\nMarket movement and other factors affecting AUM include estimated market movement, plan administrative and investment advisory fees, client loans, hardship and other defined contribution account withdrawals, and timing differences for the data feeds for clients enrolled in our Professional Management service throughout the period. We expect that market movement would typically represent the most substantial portion of this line item in any given quarter.\nThe following table illustrates estimated changes in our AUM over the last four quarters:\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Q1'16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Q2'16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Q3'16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Q4'16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In billions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AUM, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 113.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 125.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 134.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New assets - new clients(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New assets - existing clients(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New assets - acquisitions(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset cancellations - voluntary(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset cancellations - involuntary(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Assets withdrawn - existing clients\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net new assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Market movement and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AUM, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 125.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 134.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 138.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> For quarters prior to Q1'16, these DC assets were measured as of the time of enrollment and effective Q1'16, these assets were measured on or near the end of the quarter.

For quarters presented prior to Q1'16, these assets were measured as of the time of cancellation and effective Q1'16, these assets were measured on or near the beginning of the quarter. Differences resulting from this definitional change are considered to be immaterial for the quarters presented.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the last four quarters, the weekly client files contained annual contribution rates, employer matching and salary levels for a subset of our total clients, representing approximately 91%-96% of our overall AUM. The average contribution rate is calculated using this data and extrapolated to approximate 100% of employee and employer contributions for our overall AUM.\nOur AUM increases or decreases based on several factors. AUM can increase due to market performance, by the addition of new assets as clients enroll into our discretionary portfolio management services, and by the addition of new assets from existing clients, including from employee and employer contributions into their DC accounts. AUM can decrease due to market performance and by the reduction of assets as a result of clients terminating their relationships, clients rolling their assets out of their accounts, and sponsors canceling our discretionary portfolio management services. Historically, client cancellation rates have typically increased during periods where there has been a significant decline in stock market performance. In addition, client cancellation rates are typically the highest during the six months immediately following the completion of a given promotion, and certain types of promotional techniques may result in higher than average cancellation rates at the end of the promotional period.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the approximate aggregate style exposure of the accounts we managed was as follows:\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> Domestic Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bonds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and uncategorized assets(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Uncategorized assets may include CDs, options, warrants and other vehicles not currently categorized.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe percentages in the table above can be affected by the asset exposures of the overall market portfolio of the accounts we manage, the demographics of our client population including the adoption of Income+, the number of clients who have told us that they want to assume greater or lesser investment risk, and, to a lesser extent given the amount of assets we have under management, the proportion of our clients for whom we have completed the transition from their initial portfolio.\nA substantial portion of the assets we manage is invested in equity securities, the market prices of which can vary substantially based on changes in economic conditions. An additional portion is invested in fixed income securities, which will generally have lower volatility than the equity market. Therefore, while any changes in equity market performance would significantly affect the value of our AUM, particularly for the AUM invested in equity securities, such changes would typically result in lower volatility for our AUM than the volatility of the equity market as a whole. Because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from the value of our AUM, changes in fixed income or equity market performance could significantly affect the amount of revenue in a given period. If any of these factors reduces our AUM, the amount of client fees we would earn for managing those assets would decline, which in turn could negatively impact our revenue.\nThe trends associated with our professional management revenue are driven primarily by trends related to our AUM, as well as the trends related to client fees. The factors primarily affecting our AUM include our ability to enroll and retain clients in our discretionary portfolio management services, to retain existing and to sign new contracts with sponsors, providers and custodians, the level of employee, employer and individual investor contributions and market performance. The factors primarily affecting our client fees include the value of services provided and related industry pricing trends, as well as the contractually-negotiated fee rates we receive for our DC subadvisory services and fee changes as a result of achieving certain sponsor-based enrollment milestones for our DC direct advisory services.\nPlatform Revenue\nWe derive platform revenue from recurring, subscription-based fees for access to our services, including Online Advice, education and guidance, and to a lesser extent, from setup fees. Online Advice is a non-discretionary, Internet-based investment advisory service, which includes personalized online savings and investment advice and retirement income projections for clients who want to manage their retirement themselves. The arrangements generally provide for our fees to be paid by the plan sponsor, plan provider or the DC plan itself, depending on the plan structure. Platform revenue is generally paid annually or quarterly in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period beginning after the completion of customer setup and data connectivity. Setup fees are recognized ratably over seven years.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue includes fees for non-retirement account servicing, franchise royalty fees, reimbursement for a portion of marketing and client materials from certain subadvisory relationships and reimbursement for providing personal statements to prospective clients from a limited number of plan sponsors. The fees for non-retirement account servicing do not impact client fees paid for discretionary portfolio management services, and are disclosed in the applicable Form ADV of our advisory subsidiaries. Due to a contract modification, we no longer expect to have account servicing fee revenue effective January 1, 2017. Franchise royalty fees were applicable for the period of February 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016 and recognized as revenue as the services were performed by the franchisees. The franchise royalty fees were based on specified percentages of the franchisees' advisory fees billed to their clients, which were primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of the AUM and are affected by changes in the AUM. As we have acquired all remaining franchises, we no longer expect to have franchise royalty revenue subsequent to October 1, 2016. Professional management revenue earned subsequent to the respective acquisition date of the franchises is included in professional management revenue. Costs associated with reimbursed printed fulfillment materials are expensed to cost of revenue as incurred.\nCosts and Expenses\nEmployee compensation and related expenses represent our largest expense. These expenses include employee-related expenses including wages, benefits expenses and employer payroll tax, cash incentive compensation expense, variable cash compensation expense related to ongoing asset servicing activities by advisor center advisors, commission expense, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Our cash incentive compensation plan is based, in part, on achieving pre-determined annual corporate financial objectives and may result in an increased current period expense while the anticipated revenue benefits associated with the achievement of such corporate financial objectives may be realized in future periods. We allocate compensation, including wages, cash incentive compensation expense and non-cash stock-based compensation, and other expenses from overhead departments such as human resources, facilities and information technology to our cost of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative functional areas, as well as to internal use software, which is included in amortization of intangible assets.\nWe expect our headcount to increase over time, and to be a primary area of growth in our costs and expenses. We anticipate granting equity awards to board members and certain of our employees each year that may result in significant non-cash stock-based compensation expense. We anticipate the largest grant events to typically occur in the first quarter of each year, although significant awards may also be granted at other times. In 2016, we began to issue restricted stock units as the primary stock award for non-executive employees, rather than stock options. We anticipate providing annual compensation increases to certain of our employees each year, typically in the first quarter, that would result in an increase primarily to wages and cash incentive compensation expenses.\nOther costs and expenses include the costs of fees paid to plan providers related to the exchange of plan and prospective client data as well as implementing our transaction instructions for client accounts, printed marketing and client materials and postage, facilities-related expenses, advertising including radio and digital, consulting and professional service expenses, amortization and depreciation for hardware and software purchases and support, and amortization of intangible assets.\nThe following summarizes our cost of revenue and certain significant operating expenses:\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue includes fees paid to plan providers for connectivity to plan and plan prospective client data, printed materials fulfillment costs for certain subadvisory relationships for which a portion are reimbursed, and printed client materials Also included in cost of revenue are employee-related costs for in-person dedicated advisor centers, including variable cash compensation expense related to ongoing asset servicing activities, as well as employee-related costs for call center advisors, operations, implementations, technical operations, portfolio management and client service administration. Costs in this area are related primarily to payments to third parties, employee compensation and related expenses, facilities-related expenses, purchased materials and depreciation. Costs for connectivity to plan and prospective client data are expected to increase proportionally with our professional management revenue related to DC AUM. The expenses included in cost of revenue are shared across the different revenue categories, and we are not able to meaningfully allocate such costs between separate categories of revenue. Consequently, all costs and expenses applicable to our revenue are included in the category cost of revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expense includes costs associated with defining and specifying new features and ongoing enhancement to our advice engines and other aspects of our service offerings, investment methodology, financial research, quality assurance, related administration and other costs that do not qualify for capitalization. Costs in this area are related primarily to employee compensation for our engineering, product development and investment research personnel and associated expenses, and to a lesser extent, external consulting expenses related to development, support and maintenance of our existing services.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense includes costs associated with product and consumer marketing, provider and sponsor relationship management, provider and sponsor marketing, direct sales, corporate communications, public relations, creative services, sales related call center activities, advertising and live seminars, and printing of, and postage for, marketing materials for direct advisory relationships, including amortization of direct response advertising. Costs in this area are related primarily to employee compensation for sales and marketing personnel and related expenses, and also include commissions, printed materials and general marketing programs, including radio and digital advertising. Amounts received for support of marketing and client acquisition efforts are credited ratably to marketing expense. The fees for such support do not impact client fees paid for discretionary portfolio management services, and are disclosed in the applicable Form ADV of the company advisory subsidiaries.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense includes costs for finance, accounting, legal, compliance, risk management and administration, as well as acquisition-related expenses, when applicable. Costs in this area include employee compensation and related expenses, and fees for consulting and professional services. We have incurred and we expect that we will continue to incur expenses as a result of being a public company for, among other things, SEC reporting and compliance, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, director compensation, insurance, and other similar expenses.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of acquisition-related assets such as customer relationships, trademarks and trade names over the estimated useful lives using a straight-line method of amortization. It also includes the amortization of internal use software, which includes engineering costs associated with enhancing our advisory service platform and developing internal systems for tracking client data, including AUM, client cancellations and other related client and customer experience statistics. Associated direct development costs are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated lives, typically two to three years, of the underlying technology. Costs associated with internal use software include employee compensation and related expenses, and fees for external consulting services.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisition of The Mutual Fund Store\nOn February 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of The Mutual Fund Store pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Mergers (the Merger Agreement\u201d), dated as of November 5, 2015, as amended, by and among Financial Engines, Mayberry Acquisition Sub I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Financial Engines, Mayberry Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Financial Engines, Mayberry Acquisition Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned third tier subsidiary of Merger Sub 1, Kansas City 727 Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation, TMFS Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation, Kansas City 727 Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability corporation (together with its subsidiaries, The Mutual Fund Store\u201d), and, solely in its capacity as representative of the Sellers, WP Fury Holdings, LLC. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, after a series of transactions, The Mutual Fund Store became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Financial Engines.\nAt the closing of the Merger, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we paid an aggregate purchase price of $513 million consisting of approximately $246 million in cash and 9,885,889 shares of our common stock, subject to closing and post-closing adjustments. A portion of the acquisition consideration was placed in an escrow fund for up to 14 months following the closing for the satisfaction of certain indemnification claims.\nFollowing the closing of the acquisition, investment funds affiliated with Warburg Pincus LLC, the former majority owner of The Mutual Fund Store, held approximately 13% of our then-outstanding shares of common stock.\nThe foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which was originally filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November 9, 2015.\nFranchise Acquisitions in April 2016\nIn April 2016, we completed the acquisition of seven franchises for total aggregate cash consideration of $14.4 million.\nFranchise Acquisitions in July and August 2016\nIn July and August 2016, we completed the acquisition of six franchises for a total aggregate cash consideration of $8.1 million.\nFranchise Acquisitions in October 2016\nIn October 2016, we completed the acquisition of the eight remaining franchises for total aggregate cash consideration of $12.8 million.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nWe believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.\nPurchase Price Accounting\nOn February 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of The Mutual Fund Store for aggregate consideration totaling approximately $513 million, consisting of approximately $246 million in cash and 9,885,889 shares of our common stock, subject to certain closing and post-closing adjustments. A portion of the acquisition consideration was placed in an escrow fund for up to 14 months following the closing for the satisfaction of certain indemnification claims. In April 2016, we completed the acquisition of seven franchises for a total aggregate cash consideration of $14.4 million. In July and August 2016, we completed the acquisition of six franchises for a total aggregate cash consideration of $8.1 million. In October 2016, we completed the acquisition of the eight remaining franchises for total aggregate cash consideration of $12.8 million. For more information on these acquisitions, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe are required to allocate the purchase consideration paid in a business combination to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and to the liabilities assumed based on their respective acquisition-date fair values, and any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair market values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition requires knowledge of current market values, and the values of assets in use, and often requires the application of considerable judgment regarding estimates and assumptions. Assumed liabilities are valued based on estimates of anticipated expenditures to be incurred to satisfy the assumed obligations, including contractual liabilities assumed, which require the exercise of professional judgment as to amounts and timing of settlement. Our estimates may include, but are not limited to, future cash flows of an acquired business, the appropriate discount rate, expected customer retention rates and the cost savings expected to be derived from an acquisition. These estimates are inherently difficult, subjective and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price allocation to the acquired assets and liabilities would be different. In addition, we make estimates when we assign useful lives to intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. These estimates are also inherently uncertain and if different estimates were used, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. Therefore, our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these assets and liabilities can have a material effect on our financial statements.\nWe review finite-lived intangible assets for triggering events such as significant changes in operations, customers or future revenue that might indicate the need to impair the assets acquired or change the useful lives of the assets acquired. Intangible assets consist of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, franchise agreements and favorable/unfavorable operating leases. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life. If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value. Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. There were no impairments or changes in useful lives of acquired intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe carrying amount of goodwill is tested for impairment each year in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant a review, by using a two-step process. We have concluded that we have a single reporting unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing, and accordingly, all goodwill resides within a single reporting unit. We compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we would perform a measurement of the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the goodwill to a determination of the implied fair value of the goodwill. If the carrying amount of the goodwill is greater than the implied value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. There were no indicators of impairment to the carrying amount of goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDirect Response Advertising\nEffective July 1, 2009, we commenced capitalization of advertising costs associated with direct advisory active enrollment campaigns, where marketing materials are sent to solicit enrollment in our Professional Management service, which caused a significant amount of costs to be capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Our advertising costs consist primarily of printed materials associated with new client solicitations, as well as internal labor costs associated with the production of these printed materials. Advertising costs that do not qualify as direct response advertising are expensed to sales and marketing at the first time the advertisement takes place. As campaign materials are modified over time, we evaluate the content to ensure we have properly identified those campaigns which qualify for capitalization per the accounting definition of direct-response advertising and expense those campaigns that do not qualify as incurred.\nDirect response advertising costs are capitalized only if the primary purpose of the advertising is to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the advertising and the direct response advertising results in probable future benefits. Advertising costs relating to passive enrollment campaigns, where the plan sponsor defaults all eligible clients into the Professional Management service unless they decline, and other general marketing materials sent to participants do not qualify as direct response advertising and are expensed to sales and marketing in the period the advertising activities first take place. Printed fulfillment costs relating to subadvisory campaigns do not qualify as direct response advertising and are expensed to cost of revenue in the period in which the expenses were incurred. Advertising costs associated with direct advisory active enrollment campaigns that result in probable future benefits qualify for capitalization as direct response advertising. The capitalized costs are amortized over the period over which the future benefits are expected to be received. Because of how we earn revenue from our Professional Management service, demonstrating that the direct response advertising related to our direct advisory active enrollment campaigns results in probable future benefits requires us to make several assumptions about the average period of probable future benefits, the gross revenue we will earn and costs we will incur as a result of each campaign.\nWe have developed forecasting methodologies that have a degree of reliability sufficient to reasonably estimate the future gross revenue stream associated with a given campaign. The estimates we use in our forecasting methodologies include average period of probable future benefits, change in AUM due to market performance, AUM cancellation rates, net contribution rates and estimated enrollment results for campaigns that have not yet been completed. We have estimated our period of probable future benefits by considering both the historical retention rate of our clients while not exceeding the number of years over which we can accurately forecast future net revenues. The change in AUM due to market performance is an estimate of future stock market performance and its estimated relative effect on our AUM. AUM cancellation rate is defined as the rate at which assets will cancel out of the Professional Management service due to voluntary client terminations. A voluntary client termination is when a client contacts us and terminates his or her membership in the Professional Management service. Involuntary cancellations (such as sponsor and employee terminations or rollovers) are captured in the net contribution rate. Net contribution rate is defined as the net amount assets will increase as a result of new contributions into the 401(k) plan less the amount assets will decrease as a result of disbursements from the 401(k) plan, as a result of involuntary cancellations. We have estimated AUM cancellation and net contribution rates by analyzing their respective historical rates. We currently have assumed a probable period of future benefits of three years, no change in AUM due to market performance and a zero net contribution rate for the purpose of calculating estimated gross revenue. The realizability of the amounts of direct response advertising reported as assets are evaluated at each balance sheet date by comparing the carrying amounts of such assets on a cost-pool-by-cost-pool basis to the probable remaining future net revenues expected to result directly from such advertising.\nAs of December 31, 2016, $5.8 million of advertising costs associated with Professional Management service active choice enrollment campaigns were reported as assets. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, we capitalized $4.6 million, $4.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively, of direct response advertising costs. Advertising expense was $6.9 million, $8.2 million and $19.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, of which direct response advertising amortization was $6.1 million, $5.5 million and $4.8 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, impairments to direct response advertising were immaterial. Advertising expense other than direct response advertising amortization, such as radio and digital advertising, was expensed as incurred.\nThe table below evaluates the sensitivity of the two estimates that are most impactful to the realizability of the net capitalized direct response advertising costs as of December 31, 2016, namely average period of probable future benefits and assumed change in our AUM due to market performance. This sensitivity analysis considered all historic and current year campaigns with a net capitalized balance as of December 31, 2016 under our current assumptions of a three-year average period of probable future benefits and 0% change in AUM due to market performance per year. The sensitivity table indicates the additional expense charges that would have been recorded as of December 31, 2016 if, effective January 1, 2016, we had assumed different levels of change in AUM due to market performance and assumed an estimated period of probable benefits other than 3 years.\nDirect Response Advertising Sensitivity Analysis\nAdditional Expense (Impairments) to be Recognized\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Assumed Change in AUM due to Market Performance (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Period of Probable Future\nBenefits:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 4 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Any comparable percentage change to AUM due to market performance, net contribution rate and AUM cancellation rate would have the same relative impact on the sensitivity analysis as they all directly impact client AUM.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions.\nWe use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe continually evaluate additional facts representing both positive and negative evidence in the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets, including scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected income from operating activities. The underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account all available evidence, including past operating results and our recent performance. In forecasting future taxable income, we did not incorporate any marked improvement in our historical enrollment rates, voluntary cancellation rates or involuntary cancellation rates. Historical differences between forecast and actual taxable profits have not resulted in material adjustments to the recognition of our deferred tax assets. We are not relying on tax planning strategies to support the realization of our deferred tax assets. Rather, we are relying primarily on expected future taxable income to support the realizability of our deferred tax assets and to a much lesser degree, the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences. Furthermore, our deferred tax liabilities are of the same character and jurisdiction as the temporary differences giving rise to our deferred tax assets and will reverse in similar periods as the temporary differences giving rise to our deferred tax assets.\nDuring the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. These tax liabilities are recognized when, despite the belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nThe Company continuously evaluates additional facts representing positive and negative evidence in the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2016, management concluded it was more likely than not that the benefit of its deferred tax assets will be realized. All tax years since inception are open and may be subject to examination in one or more jurisdictions.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense for stock option awards is estimated at the grant date based on the award's fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The determination of the fair value of stock-based option awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include volatility, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate, estimated forfeitures and expected dividends over the expected term of the awards.\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected life in years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.85%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.72%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.42%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe use the simplified\u201d method in developing an estimate of expected term of stock options. We base the risk-free interest rate on risk-free U.S. Treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options. Prior to 2016, the computation of expected volatility was based on a combination of the historical and implied volatility of comparable companies from a representative peer group based on industry and market capitalization data, as well as our own historical volatility. Beginning in 2016, we base expected volatility solely on our own historical volatility, as we had sufficient exercise history to do so. We include a dividend yield in our Black-Scholes option pricing model to reflect the anticipated dividends to be paid over the expected term of the awards.\nStock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes modification expense of $0.7 million resulting from the November 2014 consulting agreement entered into between the Company and its former Chief Executive Officer. The agreement allowed the continuation of vesting after his termination date of December 31, 2014 during a six-month consulting period of January 1, 2015 to June 30, 2015, as well as extended the post-employment exercise period of vested stock options. Stock-based compensation expense due to this modification was calculated as of the date of the agreement based upon the difference in fair value of the underlying awards immediately before and immediately after the modification. As of December 31, 2014, we reversed $1.2 million of expense previously recognized on unvested shares under the graded-vesting attribution method related to the awards that were subject to the modifications.\nWe may grant performance stock unit (PSUs) awards per the 2013-2017 Long-Term Incentive Program (the LTIP) based on objective performance criteria pre-established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Stock-based compensation expense for performance stock units (PSUs) is based on the award's fair value as of the grant date, as well as the estimated probability of achieving the objective performance criteria pre-established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The stock-based compensation expense for PSUs is recognized as expense over the requisite service period under the graded-vesting attribution method, net of estimated forfeitures. Each PSU consists of two vesting cliffs, with sixty percent eligible to vest on January 1, 2016 and forty percent eligible to vest on January 1, 2018. Depending on performance against the target metrics, vesting will be between 0% and 140% of target value for each of the vesting cliffs. On a quarterly basis, the estimated probability of achieving the objective performance criteria is re-evaluated by management and the expense is adjusted accordingly at the end of each balance sheet period. The number of shares of our common stock issued to the award recipients at the end of each of the PSU vesting periods will be based on actual achievement results.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we determined that certain performance criteria for PSUs was improbable of achievement related to December 31, 2015 performance metrics and accordingly reversed plan-to-date stock-based compensation expense of $1.2 million previously recognized related to these certain criteria. As the criteria for these certain PSUs was improbable of achievement, the related unrecognized compensation costs are excluded from the total unrecognized compensation costs related to PSUs as of December 31, 2014.\nOn January 1, 2016, performance achievement for the December 31, 2015 performance metrics that were probable of achievement resulted in 38,797 shares issued to certain executives in February 2016. Effective February 1, 2016, the performance metrics related to December 31, 2017 achievement will be based on the financial results at the consolidated level, including the acquisition of The Mutual Fund Store, per the terms of the LTIP agreement.\nWe are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. If we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures, future stock-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income, net income and net income per share. We anticipate adopting the entity-wide accounting policy election to account for forfeitures when they occur per Accounting Standards Update No. (ASU) 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017.\nAcquisition Activity\nOn February 1, 2016, Financial Engines completed the acquisition of The Mutual Fund Store for an aggregate purchase price of $513 million, consisting of approximately $246 million in cash and 9,885,889 shares of our common stock, subject to certain closing and post-closing adjustments. As a result of this acquisition, our revenue and expenses increased effective February 1, 2016 upon consolidation of our financial statements.\nIn April 2016, we completed the acquisition of seven franchises for total aggregate cash consideration of $14.4 million. In July and August 2016, we completed the acquisition of six franchises for a total aggregate cash consideration of $8.1 million. In October 2016, we completed the acquisition of the eight remaining franchises for total aggregate cash consideration of $12.8 million.\nIn connection with these acquisitions, we incurred approximately $2.7 million and $17.2 million of acquisition-related expenses that were charged to expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations.

</tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nTotal revenue increased $113.2 million, or 36%, from $310.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $423.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due primarily to growth in professional management revenue of $108.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as an increase in other revenue of $6.8 million, offset by a decrease in platform revenue of $2.4 million. Revenue due to acquisitions was $103.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Professional management revenue and platform revenue comprised 91% and 7%, respectively, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThroughout the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased all 21 franchises of The Mutual Fund Store. Approximately $6.4 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was associated with repurchased franchises, representing the incremental revenue associated with receiving all of the advisory fees rather than a royalty percentage as a result of franchise acquisitions.\nProfessional Management Revenue\nProfessional management revenue increased $108.8 million, or 39%, from $277.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $385.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase in professional management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due primarily to an increase in the estimated average AUM used to calculate fees from approximately $110.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 to approximately $127.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, as well as an increase in average basis points over the prior year as result of client agreements associated with acquired assets. This increase in average AUM was driven by new AUM of $9.8 billion as measured on March 31, 2016 acquired through The Mutual Fund Store acquisition, net new assets from new and existing clients, including contributions, and market performance. Approximately $96.5 million of professional management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was associated with acquisitions.\nPlatform Revenue\nPlatform revenue decreased $2.4 million, or 8%, from $30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $28.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease in platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due primarily to a small number of sponsor terminations, as well as platform fee reductions resulting from a small number of sponsors converting to a subadvisory plan provider. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in platform fees due to service availability at new sponsors.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue increased $6.8 million, or 245%, from $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was due primarily to the addition of account servicing fee revenue and franchise royalty revenue of $6.9 million as a result of acquisition activity.\nAs we have acquired all remaining franchises, we no longer expect to have franchise royalty revenue subsequent to October 2016. Professional management revenue earned subsequent to the respective acquisition dates of the franchises is included in professional management revenue. Due to a contract modification, we no longer expect to have account servicing fee revenue, effective January 1, 2017, which totaled approximately $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, but we do expect a decrease in operating expenses.\nCosts and Expenses\nCosts and expenses increased $112.5 million, or 43%, from $261.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $374.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was due to a $55.0 million increase in cost of revenue, a $2.4 million increase in research and development expense, a $22.8 million increase in sales and marketing expense, a $17.7 million increase in general and administrative expense, a $10.5 million increase in amortization of intangible assets, and a $4.1 million loss on reacquired franchisee rights for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Expenses increased during year ended December 31, 2016 due primarily to increased personnel and operations related to the acquisitions.\nAcross all functional areas, employee-related expenses, such as wages and cash incentive compensation expense, increased primarily as a result of acquisition activity, which included the addition of approximately 340 new employees. Non-cash stock-based compensation also increased across all functional areas due primarily to awards granted to employees acquired in February 2016, as well as to awards granted to certain executives in May 2016. In addition to compensation-related expenses, other expenses related to the acquisition of The Mutual Fund Store such as advertising expenses, with the addition of radio and digital advertising, and facilities-related expenses, with the addition of approximately 130 advisor center locations and an Overland Park, Kansas office, significantly contributed to the increase in expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOur Board of Directors approved equity awards with an estimated expense value of $14.4 million, net of estimated forfeitures, to certain of the new executive and non-executive employees related to acquisition activity, which were granted in February 2016. We are accounting for these equity awards over a four-year vesting period utilizing the graded-vesting attribution method.\nIn February 2016, our Compensation Committee approved the future grant of stock options and RSUs in May 2016 to certain executives and other employees, contingent upon receiving stockholder approval at the annual meeting of stockholders in May 2016 for additional shares to be made available under our 2009 Stock Incentive Plan. In May 2016, upon obtaining such stockholder approval, $10.8 million of stock options and RSUs were granted to certain executives and other employees, net of estimated forfeitures. In November 2016, $2.4 million of RSUs were granted to certain non-executive employees, net of estimated forfeitures. We are accounting for these equity awards over a four-year vesting period utilizing the graded-vesting attribution method.\nWe currently anticipate issuing equity awards with an aggregate estimated expense value of approximately $23.1 million, net of estimated forfeitures, to certain of our existing executive and non-executive employees in the first quarter of 2017. We expect to account for these equity awards over a four-year vesting period utilizing the graded-vesting attribution method.\nThe non-cash stock-based compensation expense associated with these awards discussed above will be in addition to the amortization of both previously and subsequently granted stock awards, including other awards expected to be granted in 2017, all of which will utilize the graded-vesting attribution method. We plan to continue to grant equity awards during fiscal year 2017 to certain of our existing employees, new employees and board members.\nEffective February 1, 2016, the performance metrics related to the LTIP will be based on the financial results at the consolidated level, per the terms of the LTIP agreements. The amounts earned under the LTIP based on such consolidated financial results may result in an increase or decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe anticipate adopting the entity-wide accounting policy election to account for forfeitures when they occur per ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017, which may cause the timing of our non-cash stock-based compensation expense to be more volatile.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue increased $55.0 million, or 42%, from $131.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $186.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. There was an increase of $18.4 million in employee-related expenses, including wages, an increase of $3.4 million in cash incentive compensation expense and an increase of $2.9 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to the majority of acquired employees categorized to cost of revenue, including advisors and other employees associated with advisor center servicing activities. In addition, variable cash compensation expense, related to ongoing asset servicing activities by acquired advisor center advisors, resulted in expense of $11.7 million. Facilities-related expenses, including rent, depreciation and overhead allocations, increased $12.3 million due primarily to acquired advisor centers and increased allocation due to increased headcount. There was also an increase of $4.0 million in fees paid to plan providers for connectivity to plan and plan participant data due primarily to an increase in professional management revenue related to DC AUM. Non-capitalized equipment-related expenses increased $1.9 million due primarily to hardware and software support expenses as a result of the acquisition. In addition, general operating expenses increased $0.7 million, travel and entertainment increased $0.6 million, hosting and production expenses increased $0.3 million, consulting expenses increased $0.3 million and other expenses increased $0.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease in printed member and subadvisory marketing materials costs as we move more towards electronic delivery. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue increased from 42% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 44% for the year ended December 31, 2016 due primarily to employee-related expense, including wages, variable cash compensation expenses and facilities-related expenses increasing at a faster rate than revenue, partially offset by data connectivity fees expense increasing at a slower rate than revenue.\nWe expect to add additional advisors to facilitate the rollout of the Personal Advisor service to our sponsors, especially in markets where we don't currently have a physical presence. We expect cost of revenue as a percent of revenue to be in the range of 44%-45% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense increased $2.4 million, or 7%, from $35.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. There was an increase of $3.7 million in employee-related expenses, including wages, an increase of $1.2 million in cash incentive compensation expense and an increase of $0.6 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Facilities-related expenses, including rent, depreciation and overhead allocations, increased $0.4 million and other expenses increased $0.1 million. These increases were partially offset by a $2.2 million increase in the amount of internal use software capitalized as increased labor rates and more developer hours were dedicated to internal use software projects for the year ended December 31, 2016, as well as a decrease of $1.4 million in consulting expenses as projects required less external support for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of revenue, research and development expense decreased from 11% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 9% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to employee-related expenses, including wages, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense increasing at a slower rate than revenue.\nWe expect to build out our financial planning capabilities and tools to support the Personal Advisor service that we are offering through the workplace. We expect most of the upfront development costs to be incurred over the next 24 months.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense increased $22.8 million, or 37%, from $61.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $84.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. There was a $9.2 million increase in marketing programs expense, due primarily to radio and digital advertising, partially offset by amounts received for support of marketing and client acquisition efforts for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, there was a $3.3 million increase in employee-related expense, including wages, and a $2.3 million increase in cash incentive compensation expense, due primarily to the addition of employees as the result of acquisition activity and annual compensation increases. There was also a $1.9 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense, due primarily to the addition of employees as the result of acquisition activity. Consulting expenses increased $4.3 million, due primarily to outside marketing services related mainly to brand and pricing evaluations. Travel and entertainment expenses increased $1.8 million, due primarily to an annual national advisors conference. Facilities-related overhead expenses, including rent, depreciation and overhead allocations, increased by $0.9 million. These increases were partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in printed marketing materials expense as more printed marketing materials qualified for capitalization in accordance with the accounting definition of direct response advertising for the year ended December 31, 2016, as well as a $0.2 million decrease in commission expense. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expenses remained constant at 20% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016.\nDue to a contract modification, effective January 1, 2017, we do expect an increase in the amounts received for support of marketing and client acquisition efforts, which offset marketing programs expense, of approximately $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $17.7 million, or 61%, from $28.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $46.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. There was an $8.1 million increase in consulting and professional services expenses, due primarily to fees related to the acquisition of The Mutual Fund Store for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, there was a $4.3 million increase in employee-related expenses, including wages, and a $2.5 million increase in cash incentive compensation expense, due primarily to the addition of employees as the result of acquisition activity, as well as annual compensation increases. There was also a $1.6 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense, due primarily to increases in headcount as a result of acquisition activity. In addition, there was a $0.7 million increase in travel and entertainment expenses, a $0.5 million increase in other equipment related expenses and a $0.5 million increase in operating and other expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in facilities-related overhead expenses, including rent, depreciation and overhead allocations. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expense increased from 9% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 11% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to an increase in acquisition-related professional services expenses relative to the increase in revenue during the year.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets increased $10.5 million, or 214%, from $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to the addition of amortization of customer relationships, and trademarks and trade names associated with acquisition activity.\nLoss on Reacquired Franchisee Rights\nIn the case of two franchise acquisitions, we assessed the fair value of these reacquired rights to be less than the amount paid to reacquire them based on market values of other recently reacquired franchisee rights. This resulted in an unfavorable reacquisition of these franchisee rights, resulting in a $4.1 million loss for these transactions for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest Income, Net\nInterest income, net of interest expense, decreased $0.2 million, or 51%, from $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as interest earned on short-term investments decreased. As of January 2016, we have sold all of our short-term investments.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net of other income, increased $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to losses on fixed asset disposals as well as notes receivable that were deemed uncollectable.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense increased from $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our effective tax rates were 36% and 42% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate increased during the year ended December 31, 2016 due primarily to non-deductible expenditures incurred in connection with acquiring The Mutual Fund Store. The lower effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due primarily to the recognition of tax benefits upon resolution of income tax uncertainties and changes in state taxes. We expect to see an effective tax rate of approximately 38%, excluding the effect of research and development credits, any changes in valuation allowances, and discrete items in future periods. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017, our effective tax rate may be more volatile. As of December 31, 2016, we continue to believe that sufficient positive evidence exists from historical operations and future projections to conclude that we are more likely than not to fully realize our federal deferred tax assets and our state deferred tax assets in future periods. We continuously evaluate additional facts representing positive and negative evidence in the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31,

year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was due primarily to growth in professional management revenue of $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, offset by decreases in platform and other revenue of $2.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Professional management revenue and platform revenue comprised 89% and 10%, respectively, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nProfessional Management Revenue\nProfessional management revenue increased $31.4 million, or 13%, from $245.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $277.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in professional management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due primarily to an increase in the average AUM used to calculate fees from approximately $97.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 to approximately $110.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase in average AUM was driven primarily by contributions, and increased net enrollment resulting from marketing campaigns and other ongoing client acquisitions, offset by market performance.\nPlatform Revenue\nPlatform revenue decreased $2.3 million, or 10%, from $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease in platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due primarily to platform fee reductions as a result of sponsors adding new asset-based discretionary portfolio management services, as well as a small number of sponsors converting to a subadvisory plan provider or terminating. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in platform fees due to service availability at new sponsors.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue decreased $0.2 million, or 8%, from $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due primarily to a decrease in reimbursable printed fulfillment materials from certain subadvisory relationships.\nCosts and Expenses\nCosts and expenses increased $40.4 million, or 18%, from $221.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $261.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was due to a $18.2 million increase in cost of revenue, a $5.8 million increase in research and development expense, an $11.2 million increase in sales and marketing expense, a $6.4 million increase in general and administrative expense and a $1.1 million decrease in amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAcross functional areas, wages, benefits and employer payroll tax expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to headcount growth and annual compensation increases effective April 1, 2015. Across all functional areas, cash incentive compensation expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due primarily to higher cash incentive plan percentage achievement for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, resulting in approximately $7.0 million more expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAcross all functional areas non-cash stock-based compensation expense increased due primarily to equity awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015. Our equity awards generally vest over four years and we utilize the graded-vesting attribution method, resulting in greater amounts of compensation expense recognized in earlier periods of the awards with declining amounts recognized in later periods.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue increased $18.2 million, or 16%, from $112.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $131.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. There was an increase of $9.1 million in fees paid to plan providers for connectivity to plan and plan participant data for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due primarily to an increase in professional management revenue. In addition, there was an increase of $4.0 million in wages, benefits, employer payroll taxes and allocated human resources expenses, an increase of $1.3 million in cash incentive compensation expense and an increase of $1.2 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Facilities-related overhead expenses, including rent and depreciation, increased $1.1 million due primarily to an increase in depreciation expense and other equipment related expenses increased $0.6 million. Consulting expense increased $0.3 million and other expenses, including printed materials and professional services, increased by $0.6 million. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue increased from 40% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 42% for the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to data connectivity fees expense increasing at a faster rate than revenue.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense increased $5.8 million, or 19%, from $29.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $35.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. There was an increase of $2.3 million in wages, benefits, employer payroll taxes and allocated human resources expenses, an increase of $2.6 million in cash incentive compensation expense and an increase of $1.4 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Facilities-related overhead expenses, including rent and depreciation, increased $0.3 million primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense, consulting expense increased $0.5 million and other expenses increased $0.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in the amount of internal use software capitalized as more developer hours were dedicated to internal use software projects for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a percentage of revenue, research and development expense increased from 10% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 11% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to an increase in cash incentive compensation relative to the increase in revenue during the same period.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense increased $11.2 million, or 22%, from $50.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $61.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. There was an increase of $4.6 million in wages, benefits, employer payroll taxes and allocated human resources expenses, an increase of $2.1 million in cash incentive compensation expense and an increase of $1.7 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, there was a $1.0 million increase in advisory printed enrollment materials expense due primarily to campaign modifications which do not qualify for capitalization per the accounting definition of direct response advertising and therefore were expensed as incurred, as well as an increase in general marketing programs of $0.3 million. There was also an increase in consulting expense of $1.2 million to support a variety of initiatives, as well as a $0.2 million increase in travel, a $0.2 million increase in equipment-related expenses and a $0.2 million increase in other expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in recruiting expenses. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expenses increased from 18% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 20% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to an increase in cash incentive compensation and wages relative to the increase in revenue during the same period.\nStarting in early 2015, we modified our existing campaign printed marketing materials for a subset of our campaigns. Due to the nature of these modifications, these new marketing campaigns no longer qualified for capitalization in accordance with the accounting definition of direct-response advertising and therefore were expensed as incurred, resulting in increased advertising expense for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $6.4 million, or 28%, from $22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $28.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. There was an increase of $0.4 million in wages, benefits, employer payroll taxes and allocated human resources expenses, an increase of $0.7 million in cash incentive compensation expense and an increase of $1.9 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, there was a $3.3 million increase in professional services and consulting expenses, which included $2.7 million of professional services expenses related to the acquisition of The Mutual Fund Store, and other expenses increased $0.1 million. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expense increased from 8% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 9% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to increases in acquisition-related professional services expenses and non-cash stock-based compensation expense relative to the increase in revenue during the same period.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of internal use software decreased $1.1 million, or 18%, from $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as there were more developer hours dedicated to updating and maintaining existing core services in prior periods, which were not capitalized as internal use software, resulting in less amortization in the current year.\nInterest Income, Net\nInterest income, net of interest expense, increased $0.2 million, or 111%, from $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as interest earned on short-term investments increased. As of January 2016, we have sold all of our short-term investments.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense decreased from $24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our effective tax rates were 39% and 36% for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate was due primarily to recognition of tax benefits upon resolution of income tax uncertainties and changes in state taxes.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly condensed consolidated statements of income data for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2016. The data have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes, and you should read the following tables together with such financial statements. The quarterly results of operations include all necessary adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this data. Results of interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year and are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nOur professional management revenue generally increased sequentially in each of the quarters presented as a result of AUM growth driven primarily by a combination of contributions, net new enrollment resulting from marketing campaigns and other ongoing client acquisitions and market appreciation, and also increased starting in the three months ended March 31, 2016 as a result of the acquisition of The Mutual Fund Store. Platform revenue has decreased slightly due primarily to platform fee reductions as a result of sponsors adding new asset-based discretionary portfolio management services, as well as a small number of sponsors converting to a subadvisory plan provider or terminating. Other revenue increased due to franchise royalty revenue and account servicing fees as a result of the acquisition of The Mutual Fund Store on February 1, 2016.\nTotal costs and expenses have fluctuated both in absolute dollars and percentage of revenue from quarter to quarter due primarily to increases in employee-related expenses related to headcount growth primarily due to the acquisition of The Mutual Fund on February 1, 2016 and more generally due to compensation increases, cash incentive compensation expense, and non-cash stock-based compensation expenses. Other fluctuations included fees paid to plan providers for connectivity to plan and plan participant data, printed marketing and client materials expenses, and facilities-related expenses. Cost of revenue generally increased in absolute dollars for each quarter presented as a result of increased data connectivity fees and headcount growth, including employees hired through acquisitions. General and administrative expenses also increased for the three months ended March 31, 2016 due to acquisition-related closing costs.\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the

and Adjusted Earnings Per Share\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net income before net interest expense (income), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, including internal use software, amortization and impairment of direct response advertising, amortization of deferred sales commissions, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, expenses related to the closing and integration of acquisitions and losses incurred on acquisitions, if applicable for the period. Adjusted net income represents net income before non-cash stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets related to assets acquired, including customer relationships, trade names and trademarks, expenses related to the closing and integration of acquisitions, losses incurred on acquisitions and certain other items such as the income tax benefit from the release of valuation allowances, if applicable for the period, partially offset by the related tax impact of these items. Adjusted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average of dilutive common share equivalents outstanding.\nOur management uses adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share as measures of operating performance, for planning purposes (including the preparation of annual budgets), to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our Board of Directors concerning our financial performance. In addition, management currently uses non-GAAP measures in determining cash incentive compensation.\nWe present adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share as supplemental performance measures because we believe that these measures provide our Board of Directors, management and investors with additional information and greater transparency with respect to our performance and decision-making. We feel these performance measures provide investors and others with a better understanding and ability to evaluate our operating results and future prospects and provides the same performance measurement information as utilized by management. Adjusted EBITDA reflects the elements of profitability that can be most directly impacted by employees and our management believes that tracking this metric motivates executives to focus on profitable growth. Management believes it is useful to exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP metrics because this expense is based upon the historical value of each award at the time of grant, which may not be reflective of the current compensation value, and the ongoing expense is outside of the control of management in the current reporting period. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items such as depreciation and various types of amortization, as well as income taxes, which are largely non-cash at this point in time. We exclude expenses related to the closing and integration of acquisitions for comparability purposes as these are short-term in nature. Management believes it is useful to exclude these items as they do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing during the period reported. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense, expenses related to the closing and integration of acquisitions, as well as losses incurred on acquisitions, for comparability purposes as these are short-term in nature, and amortization of intangible assets related to acquired assets including customer relationships, trade names and trademarks for comparability purposes. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, earnings per share or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our profitability or liquidity.\nWe understand that, although adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are frequently used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of companies, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In particular, you should consider:\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share do not reflect the non-cash component of employee compensation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized generally required prior cash outlays and generally will have to be replaced in the future by payment of cash, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGiven the limitations associated with using adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, these financial measures should be considered in conjunction with our financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income, and adjusted earnings per share to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, diluted earnings per share. Further, management also reviews GAAP measures and evaluates individual measures that are not included in adjusted EBITDA, such as our level of capital expenditures and equity issuance, among other measures.\nThe table below sets forth a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA based on our historical results:\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended

integration-related expenses in the first quarter of 2017 to be less than $5 million, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which is in addition to the $17.2 million incurred for the year ended December 31, 2016. These expenses will be added back to net income in the calculation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and will be added back to net income in the calculation of non-GAAP adjusted net income. The related tax effect adjustment will be calculated using an estimated statutory tax rate of 38.2%.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $134.2 million, compared to $345.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2015. Since February 1, 2016, we have used approximately $274.6 million of cash related to acquisitions, net of cash acquired. Over the next twelve months, and in the longer term, we expect that our cash and liquidity needs will be met by existing resources, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, and cash generated from ongoing operations. We plan to use existing cash and cash generated in the ongoing operations of our business to fund our current operations and capital expenditures.\nConsolidated Cash Flow Data\nThe following table presents information regarding our cash flows, cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016:\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 71,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 71,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by investing\nactivities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (73,500\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 129,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (248,587\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing\nactivities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21,777\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash\nequivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 178,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (170,970\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents, end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 126,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 305,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 134,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $74.8 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $71.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash provided by operating activities was the result of net income of $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to net income of $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, plus adjustments for non-cash expenses. These non-cash adjustments include $33.7 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense, $15.0 million in amortization of intangible assets including internal use software, $8.9 million of depreciation expense, $4.7 million in amortization and impairment of direct response advertising expense, $1.6 million in amortization of deferred commissions and $0.7 million for the provision for doubtful accounts, partially offset by $18.4 million in excess tax benefits associated with non-cash stock-based compensation and an increase of $1.1 million in deferred tax assets. In addition, net cash provided by operating activities increased due to a $18.8 million increase in accounts payable due primarily to an increase in excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation, a $4.4 million increase in accrued compensation due primarily to increased headcount for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, and a $1.1 million increase in deferred rent. These increases were offset by a $15.3 million increase in accounts receivable due to growth in professional management revenue mainly through acquisitions, $3.4 million of capitalized direct-response advertising for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $1.8 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $1.5 million increase in other assets, and a $1.4 million increase in prepaid expenses.\nWe incurred cash payments totaling approximately $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 associated with a change to our paid time off program for exempt employees as of January 1, 2017. We currently anticipate paying an estimated $15.4 million in annual cash incentive compensation in this first quarter of 2017.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $248.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $129.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash received, was $274.6 million related to The Mutual Fund Store transaction, as well as franchise acquisitions. We had cash provided by the sale of short-term investments of $39.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to cash used for the purchase of short-term investments of $159.6 million, offset by maturities of $180.0 million and sales of $119.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. We used $7.0 million for the purchase of property and equipment compared to $6.1 million, which included capital expenditures associated with our new Overland Park, Kansas office for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we capitalized $6.9 million of internal use software costs compared to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as increased labor rates and more developer hours were dedicated to internal use software projects for the year ended December 31, 2016. We expect to have ongoing capital expenditure requirements to support technical operations and other infrastructure needs, and expect to fund this investment with our existing cash and cash equivalents.\nOn February 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of The Mutual Fund Store for approximately $241 million in cash consideration, net of $5.0 million of cash acquired, and approximately $267 million in common stock consideration, subject to certain closing and post-closing adjustments.\nIn April 2016, we completed the acquisition of seven franchises for approximately $13.6 million in cash consideration, net of $0.8 million in holdbacks. In July and August 2016, we completed the acquisition of six franchises for approximately $7.8 million in cash consideration, net of $0.3 million in holdbacks. In October 2016, we completed the acquisition of eight franchises for approximately $12.2 million in cash consideration, net of $0.6 million in holdbacks.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we received $6.6 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options compared to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid $2.2 million for primarily previously withheld consideration for franchises acquired by The Mutual Fund Store prior to February 1, 2016. We also incurred cash payments of $3.3 million associated with net share settlements for non-cash stock-based awards minimum tax withholdings for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to annual vesting of restricted stock units.\nOn November 5, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $50.0 million of our common stock over the subsequent twelve months. We used $38.5 million of cash to repurchase our common stock for the year ended December 31, 2015. The stock repurchase program expired on November 4, 2015 and was funded by available working capital.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $16.6 million of cash dividend payments compared to $14.0 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Based on the shares outstanding as of January 31, 2017 of 62,222,714 and assuming a $0.07 per share quarterly dividend for 2017, we would estimate dividend payments to total approximately $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, including the $4.4 million payment made in January 2017. We currently expect to pay comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis in the future, however, any future determination with respect to the declaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we expect to incur cash payments in an amount necessary to satisfy the minimum tax withholding obligations for restricted stock units previously granted to employees that vest in the year ended December 31, 2017, which will be determined based on the fair value of our common stock and applicable tax rates on the vesting dates. Based on the fair value of our common stock on December 31, 2016 of $36.75 and assuming a 40% tax rate, the estimated minimum tax withholding obligations would be approximately $6.2 million, net of estimated forfeitures, during the year ended December 31, 2017. We anticipate this type of cash payment to occur throughout each year with the largest portions typically occurring in the first and fourth quarters, and with the payment amounts determined by the number of shares released, the fair value of our common stock and applicable tax rates at that point in time.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $71.3 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $71.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities was the result of net income of $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to net income of $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, plus adjustments for non-cash expenses. These non-cash adjustments include $26.0 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense, $6.1 million of depreciation expense, $4.6 million in amortization of internal use software, $5.4 million in amortization and impairment of direct response advertising expense, $1.7 million in amortization of deferred commissions and $0.9 million for the provision for doubtful accounts, partially offset by $25.1 million effect for excess tax benefits associated with non-cash stock-based compensation, an increase of $9.2 million of deferred tax assets due primarily to accrued expenses and non-cash stock-based compensation, and the amortization of (premiums) discounts on short-term investments of $0.4 million. In addition, net cash provided by operating activities increased due to a $30.9 million increase in accounts payable due primarily to an increase in excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation, a $7.0 million increase in accrued compensation as a result of higher cash incentive plan percentage achievement for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, a $1.8 million decrease in other assets as tenant improvement allowances receivable were higher as of December 31, 2014, a $0.8 million increase in deferred rent, and a $0.4 million increase in deferred revenue. These increases were partially offset by a $6.2 million increase in accounts receivable due to growth in professional management revenue, $4.3 million of capitalized direct-response advertising for the year ended December 31, 2015 and a $0.7 million increase in prepaid expenses.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $129.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $73.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we used $159.6 million for the purchase of short-term investments, offset by maturities of $180.0 million and sales of $119.9 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, we capitalized $5.0 million of internal use software costs compared to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as more developer hours were dedicated to internal use software projects for the year ended December 31, 2015. We expect to have ongoing capital expenditure requirements to support technical operations and other infrastructure needs, and expect to fund this investment with our existing cash and cash equivalents.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we received $9.2 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options compared to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we used $38.5 million for the repurchase of our common stock compared to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. We also incurred cash payments of $3.5 million associated with net share settlements for non-cash stock-based awards minimum tax withholdings for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to annual vesting of restricted stock units.\nOn November 5, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $50.0 million of our common stock over the subsequent twelve months. We used $38.5 million of cash to repurchase our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The stock repurchase program expired on November 4, 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $14.0 million of cash dividend payments compared to $11.8 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table describes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years\n1-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years\n3-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (including capital\ntenant improvements) and capital\nleases (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2016, we lease facilities under non-cancelable operating leases expiring at various dates through 2027.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "The report provides an overview of the company's financial advisory services, including discretionary portfolio management, personalized investment advice, financial planning, and retirement income solutions.

We help individuals, either online or with an advisor, develop a strategy to reach investing and retirement goals by offering a comprehensive set of services, including holistic, personalized plans for saving and investing, assessments of retirement income, and the option to meet face-to-face with a dedicated financial advisor at one of more than 130 advisor centers nationwide. Our advice and planning services cover employer-sponsored defined contribution (DC) accounts (401(k), 457, and 403(b) plans), IRA accounts, and taxable accounts.\nWe use our proprietary advice technology platform to provide our services to millions of DC plan participants in the workplace and individuals outside of the workplace on a cost-efficient basis. We believe that our services have significantly increased the accessibility to plan participants of low-cost, high-quality, independent, personalized portfolio management services, investment advice and retirement income planning.\nOur business model is based primarily on providing advisory services to DC plan participants in the workplace. We also provide advisory services directly to individual clients outside of the workplace. Clients are defined as individuals who utilize our services, including Professional Management, Personal Advisor, Online Advice, education or guidance. We work with three key constituencies: individual investors, plan sponsors (employers offering DC plans to their employees) and plan providers (companies providing administrative services to plan sponsors).\nWe maintain two types of relationships with DC plan providers. In direct advisory relationships, we are the primary advisor and a plan fiduciary. In subadvisory relationships, the plan provider (or its affiliate) is the primary advisor and plan fiduciary, and we act in a subadvisory capacity.\nIn February 2016, we completed the acquisition of Kansas City 727 Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability corporation, as well as its subsidiaries and certain affiliates, and also completed the acquisition of all franchises during the period April 2016 to October 2016 (collectively, The Mutual Fund Store\u201d).\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue through three primary sources: professional management, platform and other revenue.\nProfessional Management Revenue\nWe derive professional management revenue from client fees paid by or on behalf of both DC and individual investor clients who are enrolled in one of our discretionary portfolio management services (either the Professional Management service or the Personal Advisor service) for the management of their account assets. We continue to use the term professional management revenue to include revenue from both the Professional Management and Personal Advisor services. Our Professional Management service is a discretionary personalized portfolio management service for DC participants who want to work with or delegate the management of their retirement accounts to a professional with the help of an advisor team. Personal Advisor is a personalized service that can provide discretionary portfolio management on a client's 401(k), IRA and/or taxable assets, as well as comprehensive financial planning and a dedicated advisor representative that participants can meet with in person, online or by phone. Our retirement income solutions, including Income+ and Retirement Paycheck, which are features of our Professional Management and Personal Advisor services, respectively, provide clients approaching or in retirement with discretionary portfolio management with an income objective and steady monthly payments from their accounts during retirement, including Social Security claiming guidance and planning. The Professional Management service is generally made available to prospective clients by written agreements with the plan provider, the plan sponsor and the plan participant in a DC plan (and may be provided on a subadvisory basis); and the Personal Advisor service is generally made available by written agreements with individual investors for the Personal Advisor service.\nOur arrangements with clients using discretionary portfolio management services generally provide for fees based on the value of assets we manage and are generally payable quarterly in arrears. The majority of our client fees across both services, as well as across both advisory and subadvisory relationships for DC accounts, are calculated on a monthly basis, as the product of client fee rates and the value of assets under management (AUM) at or near the end of each month. In general, we expect this monthly methodology to reduce the impact of financial market volatility on this portion of our professional management revenue, although this methodology may result in lower client fees if the financial markets are down when client fees are calculated, even if the market had performed well earlier in the month or the quarter. For IRA and taxable accounts, our client fees are calculated on a quarterly basis at the end of each quarter. In general, we expect this quarterly methodology to potentially result in greater impact of financial market volatility on this portion of our professional management revenue and may result in lower client fees if the financial markets are down when client fees are calculated, even if the market had performed well earlier in the month or the quarter.\nPursuant to the contracts with our clients, we calculate the fees billed to clients based on the asset amounts in data files as received directly from the account provider or custodian, with no judgments or estimates on our part. None of our professional management fee revenue is based on investment performance or other incentive arrangements. Our fees generally are based on AUM, which is influenced by market performance. Our fees are not based on a share of the capital gains or appreciation in a client's account. In some cases, our client fees or the applicable fee schedule may adjust downward based on overall participant or DC AUM enrollment performance milestones over time. Our client fees are determined by the value of the assets in the client's account at specified dates and are recognized as the services are performed.\nIn order to encourage utilization of our Professional Management service, we use a variety of promotional and communication techniques, some of which can potentially impact the amount of revenue recognized, the timing of revenue recognition or both. Historically, we have seen a general preference from workplace plan sponsors to commence campaigns in the second and third quarters of the year and we expect this trend to continue. We would generally expect our professional management revenue to continue to increase as a percentage of overall revenue, which will cause our revenue to become increasingly more sensitive to market performance.\nProfessional management revenue is earned as services are performed. We use estimates primarily related to the portion of professional management revenue that has not been invoiced and is not otherwise due from the customer at period end.\nProfessional Management Revenue Metrics\nAUM is defined as the amount of assets that we manage as part of our discretionary portfolio management services, including assets managed through franchises during the period of February 2016 to October 2016. Our AUM is the value of assets under management as reported by plan providers and custodians at or near the end of each month or quarter.\nDC AUM is the DC asset balances associated with clients enrolled in the Professional Management service, including those at plan sponsors where enrollment campaigns are not yet concluded or have not yet commenced, as of a specified date. We measure enrollment in our Professional Management service by DC clients as a percentage of eligible DC prospective clients and by DC AUM as a percentage of defined contribution account Assets Under Contract (DC AUC). IRA and taxable account AUM represent the IRA and taxable account asset balances associated with those clients enrolled in the Personal Advisor service as of a specified date.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $127.7 billion of DC AUM and $10.3 billion of IRA and taxable account AUM associated with approximately 1,012,000 total clients.\nDC AUC is defined as the amount of assets in DC plans under contract for which the Professional Management service has been made available to eligible prospective clients in the workplace. Our DC AUC and eligible prospective clients do not include assets or prospective clients in DC plans where we have signed contracts but for which we have not yet made the Professional Management service available.\nEligible prospective clients and DC AUC are reported by plan providers with varying frequency and at different points in time, and are not always updated or marked to market. If markets have declined or if assets have left the plan since the reporting date, our DC AUC may be overstated. If markets have risen, or if assets have been added to the plan, since the reporting date, our DC AUC may be understated. Some prospective clients may not be eligible for our services due to plan sponsor limitations on employees treated as insiders for purposes of securities laws or other characteristics of the prospective client. Certain securities within a plan prospective client's account may be ineligible for management by us, such as employer stock subject to trading restrictions, and we do not manage or charge a fee for that portion of the account. In both of these circumstances, assets of the relevant prospective clients may be included in DC AUC but cannot be converted to DC AUM. We believe that DC AUC can be a useful indicator of the additional DC plan assets available for enrollment efforts that, if successful, would result in these assets becoming DC AUM. We believe that total eligible prospective clients provides a useful approximation of the number of workplace-based prospective clients available for enrollment into our Professional Management service.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.05 trillion of DC AUC and 9.4 million prospective clients in DC plans for which the Professional Management service is available, which includes approximately $450 billion of DC AUC and 4.1 million prospective clients in DC plans at 205 plan sponsors for which Income+ has been made available to prospective clients.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had 382 Income+ plan sponsor contracts, including the aforementioned 205 plan sponsors where Income+ has been made available to prospective clients and 177 plan sponsors for which the Professional Management service has not yet been made available, representing a total of approximately $596 billion of DC AUC and 5.6 million prospective clients.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 10.3% of DC eligible prospective clients were enrolled as clients and 12.1% of DC AUC was enrolled as DC AUM.\nChanges in AUM\nThe following definitions are provided and relate to the table below, illustrating estimated changes in our AUM over the last four quarters.\nNew assets from new clients represents the aggregate amount of new AUM, measured at or near the end of the quarter, from new clients who enrolled in one of our discretionary portfolio management services within the quarter. We receive DC account balances for each new client at least weekly, and accordingly, we are generally able to measure the DC account asset balances within a week of the end of the quarter for new clients. For new clients with new IRA and taxable accounts assets, we are generally able to measure the account balances as of the last day of the quarter. New client assets for IRA and taxable accounts are those assets acquired within a ninety-day period after enrollment during which assets may be rolled into those accounts, and new client assets acquired in the subsequent quarter after enrollment are valued as of the last day of that subsequent quarter.\nNew assets from existing clients represents the aggregate amount of new AUM within the quarter from existing clients who originally enrolled in one of our discretionary portfolio management services during a prior period. These new assets include employer and employee contributions into DC plan accounts, as well as assets added by existing clients into new or existing IRA and taxable accounts. Employer and employee DC contributions data is estimated each quarter from annual contribution rates based on data received from plan providers or plan sponsors. Typically, we receive data from plan providers or plan sponsors via weekly client files, allowing us to estimate contributions for those clients for whom we have received this data. After the first 90 days, new clients become existing clients. For new IRA and taxable account assets, we are generally able to measure the new assets from existing clients as of the date the additional assets are deposited.\nVoluntary cancellations represent the aggregate amount of assets, measured at or near the start of the quarter, for clients who have voluntarily terminated their discretionary portfolio management service relationship within the period. Clients may cancel at any time without any requirement to provide advance notice. Our quarter-end AUM excludes all of the assets of any accounts cancelled by a client prior to the end of the last day of the quarter. We receive DC account balances for each client at least weekly, and accordingly, we are able to measure the DC account asset balances within a week of the start of the quarter for existing clients. For existing IRA and taxable accounts assets, we are able to measure the account balances as of the first day of the quarter.\nInvoluntary cancellations represent the aggregate amount of DC assets, measured at or near the start of the quarter, for clients whose Professional Management service relationship was terminated within the period for reasons other than a voluntary termination. Such cancellations may occur when all of the client's account balances have been reduced to zero or when the cancellation of a plan sponsor contract for the Professional Management service has become effective within the period. Plan sponsors may cancel their contract for the provision of Professional Management services upon specified notice or without notice for fiduciary reasons or breach of contract. If a plan sponsor has provided advance notice of cancellation of the plan sponsor contract, however, the AUM for clients of that plan sponsor is included in our AUM until the effective date of the cancellation, which is typically the business day following the termination date, after which it is no longer part of our AUM. If a client's accounts value falls to zero, either upon the effective date of a sponsor cancellation or as a result of the client transferring the entire balance of their accounts, we will terminate their Professional Management service relationship.\nAssets withdrawn by existing clients includes voluntary withdrawals from IRA and taxable accounts. Voluntary withdrawals represent the aggregate amount of assets, measured at the time of withdrawal, for clients who took automatic distributions or who otherwise withdrew funds from their managed IRA or taxable accounts without terminating their service relationship within the period.\nMarket movement and other factors affecting AUM include estimated market movement, plan administrative and investment advisory fees, client loans, hardship and other defined contribution account withdrawals, and timing differences for the data feeds for clients enrolled in our Professional Management service throughout the period. We expect that market movement would typically represent the most substantial portion of this line item in any given quarter.\nThe following table illustrates estimated changes in our AUM over the last four quarters:\n\n (1) For quarters prior to Q1'16, these DC assets were measured as of the time of enrollment and effective Q1'16, these assets were measured on or near the end of the quarter. Differences resulting from this definitional change are considered to be immaterial for the periods presented. \n (2) For Q1'16, Q2'16, Q3'16 and Q4'16, we estimate employer and employee DC plan contributions to be $1.9 billion, $1.9 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. \n (3) The value of the AUM as of March 31, 2016 that resulted from The Mutual Fund Store acquisition on February 1, 2016. \n (4) For quarters prior to Q1'16, these assets were measured as of the time of cancellation and effective Q1'16, these assets were measured on or near the beginning of the quarter. Differences resulting from this definitional change are considered to be immaterial for the periods presented. \n (5) Involuntary client cancellations due to the effective date of a plan sponsor cancellation occurring between January 1, 2017 and January 31, 2017 would cause the total AUM that was reported as of December 31, 2016 to be reduced by 0.5%. For quarters presented prior to Q1'16, these assets were measured as of the time of cancellation and effective Q1'16, these assets were measured on or near the beginning of the quarter. Differences resulting from this definitional change are considered to be immaterial for the quarters presented. \nFor the last four quarters, the weekly client files contained annual contribution rates, employer matching and salary levels for a subset of our total clients, representing approximately 91%-96% of our overall AUM. The average contribution rate is calculated using this data and extrapolated to approximate 100% of employee and employer contributions for our overall AUM.\nOur AUM increases or decreases based on several factors. AUM can increase due to market performance, by the addition of new assets as clients enroll into our discretionary portfolio management services, and by the addition of new assets from existing clients, including from employee and employer contributions into their DC accounts. AUM can decrease due to market performance and by the reduction of assets as a result of clients terminating their relationships, clients rolling their assets out of their accounts, and sponsors canceling our discretionary portfolio management services. Historically, client cancellation rates have typically increased during periods where there has been a significant decline in stock market performance. In addition, client cancellation rates are typically the highest during the six months immediately following the completion of a given promotion, and certain types of promotional techniques may result in higher than average cancellation rates at the end of the promotional period.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the approximate aggregate style exposure of the accounts we managed was as follows:\n\n (1) Uncategorized assets may include CDs, options, warrants and other vehicles not currently categorized. \nThe percentages in the table above can be affected by the asset exposures of the overall market portfolio of the accounts we manage, the demographics of our client population including the adoption of Income+, the number of clients who have told us that they want to assume greater or lesser investment risk, and, to a lesser extent given the amount of assets we have under management, the proportion of our clients for whom we have completed the transition from their initial portfolio.\nA substantial portion of the assets we manage is invested in equity securities, the market prices of which can vary substantially based on changes in economic conditions. An additional portion is invested in fixed income securities, which will generally have lower volatility than the equity market. Therefore, while any changes in equity market performance would significantly affect the value of our AUM, particularly for the AUM invested in equity securities, such changes would typically result in lower volatility for our AUM than the volatility of the equity market as a whole. Because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from the value of our AUM, changes in fixed income or equity market performance could significantly affect the amount of revenue in a given period. If any of these factors reduces our AUM, the amount of client fees we would earn for managing those assets would decline, which in turn could negatively impact our revenue.\nThe trends associated with our professional management revenue are driven primarily by trends related to our AUM, as well as the trends related to client fees. The factors primarily affecting our AUM include our ability to enroll and retain clients in our discretionary portfolio management services, to retain existing and to sign new contracts with sponsors, providers and custodians, the level of employee, employer and individual investor contributions and market performance. The factors primarily affecting our client fees include the value of services provided and related industry pricing trends, as well as the contractually-negotiated fee rates we receive for our DC subadvisory services and fee changes as a result of achieving certain sponsor-based enrollment milestones for our DC direct advisory services.\nPlatform Revenue\nWe derive platform revenue from recurring, subscription-based fees for access to our services, including Online Advice, education and guidance, and to a lesser extent, from setup fees. Online Advice is a non-discretionary, Internet-based investment advisory service, which includes personalized online savings and investment advice and retirement income projections for clients who want to manage their retirement themselves. The arrangements generally provide for our fees to be paid by the plan sponsor, plan provider or the DC plan itself, depending on the plan structure. Platform revenue is generally paid annually or quarterly in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period beginning after the completion of customer setup and data connectivity. Setup fees are recognized ratably over seven years.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue includes fees for non-retirement account servicing, franchise royalty fees, reimbursement for a portion of marketing and client materials from certain subadvisory relationships and reimbursement for providing personal statements to prospective clients from a limited number of plan sponsors. The fees for non-retirement account servicing do not impact client fees paid for discretionary portfolio management services, and are disclosed in the applicable Form ADV of our advisory subsidiaries. Due to a contract modification, we no longer expect to have account servicing fee revenue effective January 1, 2017. Franchise royalty fees were applicable for the period of February 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016 and recognized as revenue as the services were performed by the franchisees. The franchise royalty fees were based on specified percentages of the franchisees' advisory fees billed to their clients, which were primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of the AUM and are affected by changes in the AUM. As we have acquired all remaining franchises, we no longer expect to have franchise royalty revenue subsequent to October 1, 2016. Professional management revenue earned subsequent to the respective acquisition date of the franchises is included in professional management revenue. Costs associated with reimbursed printed fulfillment materials are expensed to cost of revenue as incurred.\nCosts and Expenses\nEmployee compensation and related expenses represent our largest expense. These expenses include employee-related expenses including wages, benefits expenses and employer payroll tax, cash incentive compensation expense, variable cash compensation expense related to ongoing asset servicing activities by advisor center advisors, commission expense, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Our cash incentive compensation plan is based, in part, on achieving pre-determined annual corporate financial objectives and may result in an increased current period expense while the anticipated revenue benefits associated with the achievement of such corporate financial objectives may be realized in future periods. We allocate compensation, including wages, cash incentive compensation expense and non-cash stock-based compensation, and other expenses from overhead departments such as human resources, facilities and information technology to our cost of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative functional areas, as well as to internal use software, which is included in amortization of intangible assets.\nWe expect our headcount to increase over time, and to be a primary area of growth in our costs and expenses. We anticipate granting equity awards to board members and certain of our employees each year that may result in significant non-cash stock-based compensation expense. We anticipate the largest grant events to typically occur in the first quarter of each year, although significant awards may also be granted at other times. In 2016, we began to issue restricted stock units as the primary stock award for non-executive employees, rather than stock options. We anticipate providing annual compensation increases to certain of our employees each year, typically in the first quarter, that would result in an increase primarily to wages and cash incentive compensation expenses.\nOther costs and expenses include the costs of fees paid to plan providers related to the exchange of plan and prospective client data as well as implementing our transaction instructions for client accounts, printed marketing and client materials and postage, facilities-related expenses, advertising including radio and digital, consulting and professional service expenses, amortization and depreciation for hardware and software purchases and support, and amortization of intangible assets.\nThe following summarizes our cost of revenue and certain significant operating expenses:\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue includes fees paid to plan providers for connectivity to plan and plan prospective client data, printed materials fulfillment costs for certain subadvisory relationships for which a portion are reimbursed, and printed client materials Also included in cost of revenue are employee-related costs for in-person dedicated advisor centers, including variable cash compensation expense related to ongoing asset servicing activities, as well as employee-related costs for call center advisors, operations, implementations, technical operations, portfolio management and client service administration. Costs in this area are related primarily to payments to third parties, employee compensation and related expenses, facilities-related expenses, purchased materials and depreciation. Costs for connectivity to plan and prospective client data are expected to increase proportionally with our professional management revenue related to DC AUM. The expenses included in cost of revenue are shared across the different revenue categories, and we are not able to meaningfully allocate such costs between separate categories of revenue. Consequently, all costs and expenses applicable to our revenue are included in the category cost of revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expense includes costs associated with defining and specifying new features and ongoing enhancement to our advice engines and other aspects of our service offerings, investment methodology, financial research, quality assurance, related administration and other costs that do not qualify for capitalization. Costs in this area are related primarily to employee compensation for our engineering, product development and investment research personnel and associated expenses, and to a lesser extent, external consulting expenses related to development, support and maintenance of our existing services.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense includes costs associated with product and consumer marketing, provider and sponsor relationship management, provider and sponsor marketing, direct sales, corporate communications, public relations, creative services, sales related call center activities, advertising and live seminars, and printing of, and postage for, marketing materials for direct advisory relationships, including amortization of direct response advertising. Costs in this area are related primarily to employee compensation for sales and marketing personnel and related expenses, and also include commissions, printed materials and general marketing programs, including radio and digital advertising. Amounts received for support of marketing and client acquisition efforts are credited ratably to marketing expense. The fees for such support do not impact client fees paid for discretionary portfolio management services, and are disclosed in the applicable Form ADV of the company advisory subsidiaries.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense includes costs for finance, accounting, legal, compliance, risk management and administration, as well as acquisition-related expenses, when applicable. Costs in this area include employee compensation and related expenses, and fees for consulting and professional services. We have incurred and we expect that we will continue to incur expenses as a result of being a public company for, among other things, SEC reporting and compliance, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, director compensation, insurance, and other similar expenses.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of acquisition-related assets such as customer relationships, trademarks and trade names over the estimated useful lives using a straight-line method of amortization. It also includes the amortization of internal use software, which includes engineering costs associated with enhancing our advisory service platform and developing internal systems for tracking client data, including AUM, client cancellations and other related client and customer experience statistics. Associated direct development costs are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated lives, typically two to three years, of the underlying technology. Costs associated with internal use software include employee compensation and related expenses, and fees for external consulting services.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisition of The Mutual Fund Store\nOn February 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of The Mutual Fund Store pursuant to an Agreement", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of independent, technology-enabled comprehensive financial advisory services, discretionary portfolio management, personalized investment advice, financial and retirement income planning, financial education and guidance. We help individuals, either online or with an advisor, develop a strategy to reach investing and retirement goals by offering a comprehensive set of services, including holistic, personalized plans for saving and investing, assessments of retirement income, and the option to meet face-to-face with a dedicated financial advisor at one of more than 130 advisor centers nationwide. Our advice and planning services cover employer-sponsored defined contribution (DC) accounts (401(k), 457, and 403(b) plans), IRA accounts, and taxable accounts.\nWe use our proprietary advice technology platform to provide our services to millions of DC plan participants in the workplace and individuals outside of the workplace on a cost-efficient basis. We believe that our services have significantly increased the accessibility to plan participants of low-cost, high-quality, independent, personalized portfolio management services, investment advice and retirement income planning.\nOur business model is based primarily on providing advisory services to DC plan participants in the workplace. We also provide advisory services directly to individual clients outside of the workplace. Clients are defined as individuals who utilize our services, including Professional Management, Personal Advisor, Online Advice, education or guidance. We work with three key constituencies: individual investors, plan sponsors (employers offering DC plans to their employees) and plan providers (companies providing administrative services to plan sponsors).\nWe maintain two types of relationships with DC plan providers. In direct advisory relationships, we are the primary advisor and a plan fiduciary. In subadvisory relationships, the plan provider (or its affiliate) is the primary advisor and plan fiduciary, and we act in a subadvisory capacity.\nIn February 2016, we completed the acquisition of Kansas City 727 Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability corporation, as well as its subsidiaries and certain affiliates, and also completed the acquisition of all franchises during the period April 2016 to October 2016 (collectively, The Mutual Fund Store\u201d).\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue through three primary sources: professional management, platform and other revenue.\nProfessional Management Revenue\nWe derive professional management revenue from client fees paid by or on behalf of both DC and individual investor clients who are enrolled in one of our discretionary portfolio management services (either the Professional Management service or the Personal Advisor service) for the management of their account assets. We continue to use the term professional management revenue to include revenue from both the Professional Management and Personal Advisor services. Our Professional Management service is a discretionary personalized portfolio management service for DC participants who want to work with or delegate the management of their retirement accounts to a professional with the help of an advisor team. Personal Advisor is a personalized service that can provide discretionary portfolio management on a client's 401(k), IRA and/or taxable assets, as well as comprehensive financial planning and a dedicated advisor representative that participants can meet with in person, online or by phone. Our retirement income solutions, including Income+ and Retirement Paycheck, which are features of our Professional Management and Personal Advisor services, respectively, provide clients approaching or in retirement with discretionary portfolio management with an income objective and steady monthly payments from their accounts during retirement, including Social Security claiming guidance and planning. The Professional Management service is generally made available to prospective clients by written agreements with the plan provider, the plan sponsor and the plan participant in a DC plan (and may be provided on a subadvisory basis); and the Personal Advisor service is generally made available by written agreements with individual investors for the Personal Advisor service.\nOur arrangements with clients using discretionary portfolio management services generally provide for fees based on the value of assets we manage and are generally payable quarterly in arrears. The majority of our client fees across both services, as well as across both advisory and subadvisory relationships for DC accounts, are calculated on a monthly basis, as the product of client fee rates and the value of assets under management (AUM) at or near the end of each month. In general, we expect this monthly methodology to reduce the impact of financial market volatility on this portion of our professional management revenue, although this methodology may result in lower client fees if the financial markets are down when client fees are calculated, even if the market had performed well earlier in the month or the quarter. For IRA and taxable accounts, our client fees are calculated on a quarterly basis at the end of each quarter. In general, we expect this quarterly methodology to potentially result in greater impact of financial market volatility on this portion of our professional management revenue and may result in lower client fees if the financial markets are down when client fees are calculated, even if the market had performed well earlier in the month or the quarter.\nPursuant to the contracts with our clients, we calculate the fees billed to clients based on the asset amounts in data files as received directly from the account provider or custodian, with no judgments or estimates on our part. None of our professional management fee revenue is based on investment performance or other incentive arrangements. Our fees generally are based on AUM, which is influenced by market performance. Our fees are not based on a share of the capital gains or appreciation in a client's account. In some cases, our client fees or the applicable fee schedule may adjust downward based on overall participant or DC AUM enrollment performance milestones over time. Our client fees are determined by the value of the assets in the client's account at specified dates and are recognized as the services are performed.\nIn order to encourage utilization of our Professional Management service, we use a variety of promotional and communication techniques, some of which can potentially impact the amount of revenue recognized, the timing of revenue recognition or both. Historically, we have seen a general preference from workplace plan sponsors to commence campaigns in the second and third quarters of the year and we expect this trend to continue. We would generally expect our professional management revenue to continue to increase as a percentage of overall revenue, which will cause our revenue to become increasingly more sensitive to market performance.\nProfessional management revenue is earned as services are performed. We use estimates primarily related to the portion of professional management revenue that has not been invoiced and is not otherwise due from the customer at period end.\nProfessional Management Revenue Metrics\nAUM is defined as the amount of assets that we manage as part of our discretionary portfolio management services, including assets managed through franchises during the period of February 2016 to October 2016. Our AUM is the value of assets under management as reported by plan providers and custodians at or near the end of each month or quarter.\nDC AUM is the DC asset balances associated with clients enrolled in the Professional Management service, including those at plan sponsors where enrollment campaigns are not yet concluded or have not yet commenced, as of a specified date. We measure enrollment in our Professional Management service by DC clients as a percentage of eligible DC prospective clients and by DC AUM as a percentage of defined contribution account Assets Under Contract (DC AUC). IRA and taxable account AUM represent the IRA and taxable account asset balances associated with those clients enrolled in the Personal Advisor service as of a specified date.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $127.7 billion of DC AUM and $10.3 billion of IRA and taxable account AUM associated with approximately 1,012,000 total clients.\nDC AUC is defined as the amount of assets in DC plans under contract for which the Professional Management service has been made available to eligible prospective clients in the workplace. Our DC AUC and eligible prospective clients do not include assets or prospective clients in DC plans where we have signed contracts but for which we have not yet made the Professional Management service available.\nEligible prospective clients and DC AUC are reported by plan providers with varying frequency and at different points in time, and are not always updated or marked to market. If markets have declined or if assets have left the plan since the reporting date, our DC AUC may be overstated. If markets have risen, or if assets have been added to the plan, since the reporting date, our DC AUC may be understated. Some prospective clients may not be eligible for our services due to plan sponsor limitations on employees treated as insiders for purposes of securities laws or other characteristics of the prospective client. Certain securities within a plan prospective client's account may be ineligible for management by us, such as employer stock subject to trading restrictions, and we do not manage or charge a fee for that portion of the account. In both of these circumstances, assets of the relevant prospective clients may be included in DC AUC but cannot be converted to DC AUM. We believe that DC AUC can be a useful indicator of the additional DC plan assets available for enrollment efforts that, if successful, would result in these assets becoming DC AUM. We believe that total eligible prospective clients provides a useful approximation of the number of workplace-based prospective clients available for enrollment into our Professional Management service.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.05 trillion of DC AUC and 9.4 million prospective clients in DC plans for which the Professional Management service is available, which includes approximately $450 billion of DC AUC and 4.1 million prospective clients in DC plans at 205 plan sponsors for which Income+ has been made available to prospective clients.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had 382 Income+ plan sponsor contracts, including the aforementioned 205 plan sponsors where Income+ has been made available to prospective clients and 177 plan sponsors for which the Professional Management service has not yet been made available, representing a total of approximately $596 billion of DC AUC and 5.6 million prospective clients.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 10.3% of DC eligible prospective clients were enrolled as clients and 12.1% of DC AUC was enrolled as DC AUM.\nChanges in AUM\nThe following definitions are provided and relate to the table below, illustrating estimated changes in our AUM over the last four quarters.\nNew assets from new clients represents the aggregate amount of new AUM, measured at or near the end of the quarter, from new clients who enrolled in one of our discretionary portfolio management services within the quarter. We receive DC account balances for each new client at least weekly, and accordingly, we are generally able to measure the DC account asset balances within a week of the end of the quarter for new clients. For new clients with new IRA and taxable accounts assets, we are generally able to measure the account balances as of the last day of the quarter. New client assets for IRA and taxable accounts are those assets acquired within a ninety-day period after enrollment during which assets may be rolled into those accounts, and new client assets acquired in the subsequent quarter after enrollment are valued as of the last day of that subsequent quarter.\nNew assets from existing clients represents the aggregate amount of new AUM within the quarter from existing clients who originally enrolled in one of our discretionary portfolio management services during a prior period. These new assets include employer and employee contributions into DC plan accounts, as well as assets added by existing clients into new or existing IRA and taxable accounts. Employer and employee DC contributions data is estimated each quarter from annual contribution rates based on data received from plan providers or plan sponsors. Typically, we receive data from plan providers or plan sponsors via weekly client files, allowing us to estimate contributions for those clients for whom we have received this data. After the first 90 days, new clients become existing clients. For new IRA and taxable account assets, we are generally able to measure the new assets from existing clients as of the date the additional assets are deposited.\nVoluntary cancellations represent the aggregate amount of assets, measured at or near the start of the quarter, for clients who have voluntarily terminated their discretionary portfolio management service relationship within the period. Clients may cancel at any time without any requirement to provide advance notice. Our quarter-end AUM excludes all of the assets of any accounts cancelled by a client prior to the end of the last day of the quarter. We receive DC account balances for each client at least weekly, and accordingly, we are able to measure the DC account asset balances within a week of the start of the quarter for existing clients. For existing IRA and taxable accounts assets, we are able to measure the account balances as of the first day of the quarter.\nInvoluntary cancellations represent the aggregate amount of DC assets, measured at or near the start of the quarter, for clients whose Professional Management service relationship was terminated within the period for reasons other than a voluntary termination. Such cancellations may occur when all of the client's account balances have been reduced to zero or when the cancellation of a plan sponsor contract for the Professional Management service has become effective within the period. Plan sponsors may cancel their contract for the provision of Professional Management services upon specified notice or without notice for fiduciary reasons or breach of contract. If a plan sponsor has provided advance notice of cancellation of the plan sponsor contract, however, the AUM for clients of that plan sponsor is included in our AUM until the effective date of the cancellation, which is typically the business day following the termination date, after which it is no longer part of our AUM. If a client's accounts value falls to zero, either upon the effective date of a sponsor cancellation or as a result of the client transferring the entire balance of their accounts, we will terminate their Professional Management service relationship.\nAssets withdrawn by existing clients includes voluntary withdrawals from IRA and taxable accounts. Voluntary withdrawals represent the aggregate amount of assets, measured at the time of withdrawal, for clients who took automatic distributions or who otherwise withdrew funds from their managed IRA or taxable accounts without terminating their service relationship within the period.\nMarket movement and other factors affecting AUM include estimated market movement, plan administrative and investment advisory fees, client loans, hardship and other defined contribution account withdrawals, and timing differences for the data feeds for clients enrolled in our Professional Management service throughout the period. We expect that market movement would typically represent the most substantial portion of this line item in any given quarter.\nThe following table illustrates estimated changes in our AUM over the last four quarters:\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Q1'16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Q2'16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Q3'16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Q4'16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In billions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AUM, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 113.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 125.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 134.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New assets - new clients(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New assets - existing clients(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New assets - acquisitions(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset cancellations - voluntary(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset cancellations - involuntary(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Assets withdrawn - existing clients\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net new assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Market movement and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AUM, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 125.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 134.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 138.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) For quarters prior to Q1'16, these DC assets were measured as of the time of enrollment and effective Q1'16, these assets were measured on or near the end of the quarter. Differences resulting from this definitional change are considered to be immaterial for the periods presented. \n (2) For Q1'16, Q2'16, Q3'16 and Q4'16, we estimate employer and employee DC plan contributions to be $1.9 billion, $1.9 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. \n (3) The value of the AUM as of March 31, 2016 that resulted from The Mutual Fund Store acquisition on February 1, 2016. \n (4) For quarters prior to Q1'16, these assets were measured as of the time of cancellation and effective Q1'16, these assets were measured on or near the beginning of the quarter. Differences resulting from this definitional change are considered to be immaterial for the periods presented. \n (5) Involuntary client cancellations due to the effective date of a plan sponsor cancellation occurring between January 1, 2017 and January 31, 2017 would cause the total AUM that was reported as of December 31, 2016 to be reduced by 0.5%. For quarters presented prior to Q1'16, these assets were measured as of the time of cancellation and effective Q1'16, these assets were measured on or near the beginning of the quarter. Differences resulting from this definitional change are considered to be immaterial for the quarters presented. \nFor the last four quarters, the weekly client files contained annual contribution rates, employer matching and salary levels for a subset of our total clients, representing approximately 91%-96% of our overall AUM. The average contribution rate is calculated using this data and extrapolated to approximate 100% of employee and employer contributions for our overall AUM.\nOur AUM increases or decreases based on several factors. AUM can increase due to market performance, by the addition of new assets as clients enroll into our discretionary portfolio management services, and by the addition of new assets from existing clients, including from employee and employer contributions into their DC accounts. AUM can decrease due to market performance and by the reduction of assets as a result of clients terminating their relationships, clients rolling their assets out of their accounts, and sponsors canceling our discretionary portfolio management services. Historically, client cancellation rates have typically increased during periods where there has been a significant decline in stock market performance. In addition, client cancellation rates are typically the highest during the six months immediately following the completion of a given promotion, and certain types of promotional techniques may result in higher than average cancellation rates at the end of the promotional period.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the approximate aggregate style exposure of the accounts we managed was as follows:\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> Domestic Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bonds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and uncategorized assets(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Uncategorized assets may include CDs, options, warrants and other vehicles not currently categorized. \nThe percentages in the table above can be affected by the asset exposures of the overall market portfolio of the accounts we manage, the demographics of our client population including the adoption of Income+, the number of clients who have told us that they want to assume greater or lesser investment risk, and, to a lesser extent given the amount of assets we have under management, the proportion of our clients for whom we have completed the transition from their initial portfolio.\nA substantial portion of the assets we manage is invested in equity securities, the market prices of which can vary substantially based on changes in economic conditions. An additional portion is invested in fixed income securities, which will generally have lower volatility than the equity market. Therefore, while any changes in equity market performance would significantly affect the value of our AUM, particularly for the AUM invested in equity securities, such changes would typically result in lower volatility for our AUM than the volatility of the equity market as a whole. Because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from the value of our AUM, changes in fixed income or equity market performance could significantly affect the amount of revenue in a given period. If any of these factors reduces our AUM, the amount of client fees we would earn for managing those assets would decline, which in turn could negatively impact our revenue.\nThe trends associated with our professional management revenue are driven primarily by trends related to our AUM, as well as the trends related to client fees. The factors primarily affecting our AUM include our ability to enroll and retain clients in our discretionary portfolio management services, to retain existing and to sign new contracts with sponsors, providers and custodians, the level of employee, employer and individual investor contributions and market performance. The factors primarily affecting our client fees include the value of services provided and related industry pricing trends, as well as the contractually-negotiated fee rates we receive for our DC subadvisory services and fee changes as a result of achieving certain sponsor-based enrollment milestones for our DC direct advisory services.\nPlatform Revenue\nWe derive platform revenue from recurring, subscription-based fees for access to our services, including Online Advice, education and guidance, and to a lesser extent, from setup fees. Online Advice is a non-discretionary, Internet-based investment advisory service, which includes personalized online savings and investment advice and retirement income projections for clients who want to manage their retirement themselves. The arrangements generally provide for our fees to be paid by the plan sponsor, plan provider or the DC plan itself, depending on the plan structure. Platform revenue is generally paid annually or quarterly in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period beginning after the completion of customer setup and data connectivity. Setup fees are recognized ratably over seven years.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue includes fees for non-retirement account servicing, franchise royalty fees, reimbursement for a portion of marketing and client materials from certain subadvisory relationships and reimbursement for providing personal statements to prospective clients from a limited number of plan sponsors. The fees for non-retirement account servicing do not impact client fees paid for discretionary portfolio management services, and are disclosed in the applicable Form ADV of our advisory subsidiaries. Due to a contract modification, we no longer expect to have account servicing fee revenue effective January 1, 2017. Franchise royalty fees were applicable for the period of February 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016 and recognized as revenue as the services were performed by the franchisees. The franchise royalty fees were based on specified percentages of the franchisees' advisory fees billed to their clients, which were primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of the AUM and are affected by changes in the AUM. As we have acquired all remaining franchises, we no longer expect to have franchise royalty revenue subsequent to October 1, 2016. Professional management revenue earned subsequent to the respective acquisition date of the franchises is included in professional management revenue. Costs associated with reimbursed printed fulfillment materials are expensed to cost of revenue as incurred.\nCosts and Expenses\nEmployee compensation and related expenses represent our largest expense. These expenses include employee-related expenses including wages, benefits expenses and employer payroll tax, cash incentive compensation expense, variable cash compensation expense related to ongoing asset servicing activities by advisor center advisors, commission expense, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Our cash incentive compensation plan is based, in part, on achieving pre-determined annual corporate financial objectives and may result in an increased current period expense while the anticipated revenue benefits associated with the achievement of such corporate financial objectives may be realized in future periods. We allocate compensation, including wages, cash incentive compensation expense and non-cash stock-based compensation, and other expenses from overhead departments such as human resources, facilities and information technology to our cost of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative functional areas, as well as to internal use software, which is included in amortization of intangible assets.\nWe expect our headcount to increase over time, and to be a primary area of growth in our costs and expenses. We anticipate granting equity awards to board members and certain of our employees each year that may result in significant non-cash stock-based compensation expense. We anticipate the largest grant events to typically occur in the first quarter of each year, although significant awards may also be granted at other times. In 2016, we began to issue restricted stock units as the primary stock award for non-executive employees, rather than stock options. We anticipate providing annual compensation increases to certain of our employees each year, typically in the first quarter, that would result in an increase primarily to wages and cash incentive compensation expenses.\nOther costs and expenses include the costs of fees paid to plan providers related to the exchange of plan and prospective client data as well as implementing our transaction instructions for client accounts, printed marketing and client materials and postage, facilities-related expenses, advertising including radio and digital, consulting and professional service expenses, amortization and depreciation for hardware and software purchases and support, and amortization of intangible assets.\nThe following summarizes our cost of revenue and certain significant operating expenses:\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue includes fees paid to plan providers for connectivity to plan and plan prospective client data, printed materials fulfillment costs for certain subadvisory relationships for which a portion are reimbursed, and printed client materials Also included in cost of revenue are employee-related costs for in-person dedicated advisor centers, including variable cash compensation expense related to ongoing asset servicing activities, as well as employee-related costs for call center advisors, operations, implementations, technical operations, portfolio management and client service administration. Costs in this area are related primarily to payments to third parties, employee compensation and related expenses, facilities-related expenses, purchased materials and depreciation. Costs for connectivity to plan and prospective client data are expected to increase proportionally with our professional management revenue related to DC AUM. The expenses included in cost of revenue are shared across the different revenue categories, and we are not able to meaningfully allocate such costs between separate categories of revenue. Consequently, all costs and expenses applicable to our revenue are included in the category cost of revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expense includes costs associated with defining and specifying new features and ongoing enhancement to our advice engines and other aspects of our service offerings, investment methodology, financial research, quality assurance, related administration and other costs that do not qualify for capitalization. Costs in this area are related primarily to employee compensation for our engineering, product development and investment research personnel and associated expenses, and to a lesser extent, external consulting expenses related to development, support and maintenance of our existing services.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense includes costs associated with product and consumer marketing, provider and sponsor relationship management, provider and sponsor marketing, direct sales, corporate communications, public relations, creative services, sales related call center activities, advertising and live seminars, and printing of, and postage for, marketing materials for direct advisory relationships, including amortization of direct response advertising. Costs in this area are related primarily to employee compensation for sales and marketing personnel and related expenses, and also include commissions, printed materials and general marketing programs, including radio and digital advertising. Amounts received for support of marketing and client acquisition efforts are credited ratably to marketing expense. The fees for such support do not impact client fees paid for discretionary portfolio management services, and are disclosed in the applicable Form ADV of the company advisory subsidiaries.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense includes costs for finance, accounting, legal, compliance, risk management and administration, as well as acquisition-related expenses, when applicable. Costs in this area include employee compensation and related expenses, and fees for consulting and professional services. We have incurred and we expect that we will continue to incur expenses as a result of being a public company for, among other things, SEC reporting and compliance, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, director compensation, insurance, and other similar expenses.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of acquisition-related assets such as customer relationships, trademarks and trade names over the estimated useful lives using a straight-line method of amortization. It also includes the amortization of internal use software, which includes engineering costs associated with enhancing our advisory service platform and developing internal systems for tracking client data, including AUM, client cancellations and other related client and customer experience statistics. Associated direct development costs are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated lives, typically two to three years, of the underlying technology. Costs associated with internal use software include employee compensation and related expenses, and fees for external consulting services.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisition of The Mutual Fund Store\nOn February 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of The Mutual Fund Store pursuant to an Agreement"}
