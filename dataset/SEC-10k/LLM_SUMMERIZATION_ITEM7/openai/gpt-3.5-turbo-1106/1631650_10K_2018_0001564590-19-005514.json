Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section of this Annual Report of on Form 10-K titled Risk Factors.\u201d Except as may be required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements or the reasons that results could differ from these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company advancing a new therapeutic approach, including the development of proprietary product candidates, for the treatment of peanut and other food allergies. It is estimated that over 30 million people in the United States and Europe have a food allergy, with peanut allergy being the most prevalent and most commonly associated with severe outcomes and life-threatening events. There are currently no approved medical therapies to cure food allergies or prevent their symptoms. Patients with food allergies are typically counseled to practice strict dietary avoidance. When accidental exposure to food allergens invokes a serious allergic reaction, rescue therapies, such as antihistamines or injectable epinephrine, are the only recourse available. Our therapeutic approach, which we refer to as Characterized Oral Desensitization ImmunoTherapy, or CODITTM, is designed to desensitize patients to food allergens and thereby reduce the risk of having an allergic reaction upon accidental exposure or reduce symptom severity should an allergic reaction occur. CODIT is intended to reduce meaningfully the burden and anxiety experienced by food-allergic patients and their families.\nOur lead CODIT product candidate, AR101, is an investigational biologic for the treatment of patients with peanut allergy, which affects approximately three million patients in the United States and three million patients in Europe. AR101 has received Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designations for the treatment of patients 4-17 years of age from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. In February 2018, we announced positive data from our Phase 3 efficacy trial of AR101 in the United States, Canada and Europe, which we refer to as the PALISADE (Peanut Allergy Oral Immunotherapy Study of AR101 for Desensitization in Children and Adults) trial. In November 2018, we announced positive topline results real-world experience safety trial of AR101 in the United States and Canada in patients ages 4-17, which we refer to as the RAMSES (Real-World AR101 Market-Supporting Experience Study in Peanut Allergic Children Ages 4-17 Years) trial. In addition, we have two ongoing roll-over studies relating to the PALISADE and RAMSES trials.\nWe filed a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for AR101 with the FDA, in December 2018. The FDA initiated review of the BLA for AR101 in January 2019, and we expect that the FDA will determine whether the BLA has been accepted for filing by the end of March 2019. The FDA has made an initial determination that AR101, as an allergenic product candidate, is exempt from the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, or PDUFA. We are not aware of any instances in which the BLA for a product candidate that had been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation was reviewed by the FDA pursuant to processes and timelines not governed by PDUFA and, as a result, there is uncertainty as to whether the AR101 BLA will receive an expedited review typically granted to product candidates with such designation. However, we believe the FDA has had policies that pre-date and post-date PDUFA that would allow for expedited review of PDUFA-exempt applications, and we are currently engaged in discussions with the FDA regarding the review timeline for the AR101 BLA. If the Breakthrough Therapy designation for AR101 does not result in an expedited review of the BLA for AR101, the BLA will likely be reviewed under a twelve-month review period applicable to PDUFA-exempt applications. Our initial target patient population for AR101 is children and adolescents in the 4-17 age group with a diagnosed peanut allergy, which we estimate reached approximately 1.6 million patients in the United States alone during 2018.\nIn February 2018, we completed enrollment of 175 patients in our European Phase 3 efficacy trial designed with a higher efficacy bar of tolerating 1,000 mg of peanut protein in an exit food-challenge without anything more than mild, transient symptoms, which we refer to as the ARTEMIS (AR101 Trial in Europe Measuring Oral Immunotherapy Success or ARC008) trial. Treatment of all patients in this trial is now complete and we expect to report preliminary summary data from the trial in the first half of 2019.\nWe expect to submit a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in the first half of 2019. We maintain worldwide commercial rights to all of our product candidates, including AR101 and, if approved, currently intend to commercialize in the United States and Europe by developing a specialty sales force targeting a subset of the approximately 5,000 practicing allergists in the United States and allergy-focused clinicians in major European markets.\nWe are in the process of developing formulations for additional CODIT product candidates beyond peanut allergy and has formulation and manufacturing activities ongoing for a product candidate designed to treat egg allergy, AR201 and are exploring a product candidate designed to treat multi-nut allergy, including walnut allergy. Review of our investigational new drug application, or IND, for AR201 was completed by the FDA in February 2019. As such, we have been cleared to advance AR201 into a Phase 2 clinical trial, which we expect to commence in mid-2019. In addition, we are also conducting research and development activities for potential CODIT product candidates targeting other food allergies, including cow's milk allergy.\nWe maintain worldwide commercial rights to all of our product candidates, including AR101 and, if any of our product candidates are approved, we currently intend to commercialize in the United States and Europe by developing a specialty sales force targeting a subset of the approximately 5,000 practicing allergists in the United States and allergy-focused clinicians in major European markets.\nSince commencing our operations in 2011, substantially all our efforts have been focused on research, development and AR101. We have not generated any revenue from product sales and, as a result, we have incurred significant losses. We incurred net losses of $210.8 million, $131.3 million and $80.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and used $169.1 million of cash in operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our accumulated deficit was $476.2 million. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we anticipate these losses will increase as we continue our development of, seek regulatory approval for, and begin to commercialize AR101, and as we develop other product candidates.\nIn February and March 2018, we issued and sold an aggregate of 6,325,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $32.00 per share, including the closing of the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional 825,000 shares of common stock. In addition, in November 2018, we sold an additional 3,237,529 shares of our common stock to Nestl\u00e9 Health Science at a price of $30.27 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $98.0 million.\nIn January 2019, we entered into a loan agreement with an affiliate of KKR for up to $170.0 million in three tranches. Of the total loan amount, $40.0 million was funded upon the closing of the transaction, with $85.0 million to be funded upon FDA approval of AR101 and satisfaction of other customary borrowing conditions, and $45.0 million to be made available at our option in 2020, upon the satisfaction of certain borrowing conditions.\nWe currently utilize contract manufacturers for all our manufacturing activities. In June 2015, we entered into a lease for a manufacturing facility in Clearwater, Florida. In June 2017, we completed the construction of the manufacturing facility within the leased building, which we intend to handle full-scale cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practices) commercial production of AR101, if approved, and supply future clinical trials of AR101. This manufacturing facility became operational in November 2018. We plan to continue to rely on the contract manufacturer that is located at the same site to manage the operations of this new manufacturing facility. Additionally, we currently utilize specialized clinical vendors, clinical trial sites, consultants, and clinical research organizations, or CROs, to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials, and we do not yet have a sales organization. We expect to continue to significantly increase our investment in our manufacturing process and commercial organization as we prepare for the filing of a MAA with the EMA and prepare for the potential approval of our BLA for AR101 in the United States and commercial launch of AR101.\nCredit Agreement with KKR\nIn January 2019, we entered into a Credit Agreement with KKR Peanut Aggregator L.P., an affiliate of KKR LLC, which we refer to, together with the several banks and other financial institutions from time to time party to the Credit Agreement, collectively as the Lenders, and Cortland Capital Market Services LLC, as the administrative agent and the collateral agent, or Agent. The Credit Agreement consists of a six-year term loan facility for an up to aggregate principal amount of $170.0 million, which we refer to as the Term Loans. The Credit Agreement provides for an initial Term Loan of $40.0 million, which was funded in January 2019. Subject to the fulfillment of certain customary conditions precedent, including the issuance of an approval letter by the FDA with respect to a AR101 BLA on or prior to December 31, 2020, we must draw an additional $85.0 million of the Term Loans. At our option and, subject to the fulfillment of customary conditions precedent, including our achievement of aggregate net sales (as defined in the agreement) for AR101 by July 31, 2020 in an amount of at least $30.0 million, we may draw the remaining $45.0 million of the Term Loans. The Term Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest through maturity, at our election, with respect to (a) ABR Loans, 6.50% per annum and (b) LIBOR Loans, 7.50% per annum. We will begin paying accrued interest on outstanding Term Loans on March 31, 2019, and on the last business day of each March, June, September and December thereafter while any Term Loan is outstanding, as well as on the final maturity date of the Term Loans. For each interest payment date until and including the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2020, we have the option to elect whether the interest payments due on such interest payment date shall be paid in cash or paid in kind and capitalized. We have selected to pay in kind and have the interest capitalized for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019.\nPrincipal payments on the Term Loans are paid according to the following schedule: (i) on December 31, 2023, 50.0% of the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans as of such date, including any capitalized interest, (ii) on each interest payment date thereafter, 12.5% of the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans as of December 31, 2023 and (iii) on January 3, 2025, any remaining outstanding balance of the Term Loans. We are also required to make mandatory prepayments of the Term Loans under the Credit Agreement, subject to specified exceptions, with the proceeds of asset sales, debt issuances, royalty transactions, collaboration transactions, and specified other events. In addition, upon the occurrence of a change of control, we must prepay, the outstanding amount of the Term Loans.\nIf all or any of the Term Loans are prepaid or required to be prepaid under the Credit Agreement, then we will pay, in addition to such prepayment, a prepayment premium equal to (i) with respect to any such prepayment paid on or prior to January 3, 2021, the amount, if any, by which (a) the present value as of such date of determination of (x) 105.00% of the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid plus (y) all required interest payments that would have been due on the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid through and including January 3, 2021, computed using a discount rate equal to the treasury rate most nearly equal to the period from such date of prepayment to January 3, 2021 plus 50 basis points exceeds (b) the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid, (ii) with respect to any prepayment paid or required to be paid after January 3, 2021 but on or prior to January 3, 2022, 5.00% of the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid, (iii) with respect to any prepayment paid or required to be paid after January 3, 2022 but on or prior to January 3, 2023, 2.00% of the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid and (iv) with respect to any prepayment paid or required to be prepaid thereafter, 0.00% of the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid. If we receive an approval letter by the FDA with respect to a AR101 BLA on or prior to December 31, 2020, we must pay on the earlier of (i) the date on which commitments have been terminated and no Term Loans are outstanding and (ii) the Interest Payment Date falling in the first full fiscal quarter after receipt of such regulatory approval, a premium in an amount equal to $3.4 million and the prepayment premium for such date on a principal amount equal to $85.0 million. The premium with respect to the regulatory approval described in the immediately preceding sentence is not due if we draw the additional (after the first $40.00 million) $85.0 million of the Term Loans.\nUpon the prepayment or repayment of all or any of the Term Loans, we will pay an additional (in addition to the prepayment premium) exit fee in an amount equal to 4.00% of the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid or repaid. In addition, we paid certain customary fees and expenses to the Agent and other service providers upon the closing of the transaction.\nThe obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of our tangible and intangible property. The Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default, including, covenants and restrictions that among other things, require us and our subsidiary guarantors to satisfy a minimum cash balance covenant and restricts our ability and each of our subsidiaries' ability to incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, make loans and investments, engage in mergers and acquisitions, engage in asset sales or sale and leaseback transactions, and declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock. A failure to comply with these covenants could permit the Lenders under the Credit Agreement to declare the Term Loans, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable.\nCollaboration with Nestle Health Science\nIn November 2016, we entered into a two-year strategic collaboration with an affiliate of Nestle Health Science US Holdings, Inc. for the advancement of food allergy therapeutics and issued and sold to Nestle Health Science US Holdings, Inc. (together with its affiliate, Nestle Health Science) 7,552,084 shares of common stock in a private placement at a price of $19.20 per share, which represented approximately 15.1% of our outstanding shares at the time of the transaction. Subject to certain limited exceptions, Nestle Health Science agreed to a two-year market standoff provision under which it agreed not to sell or transfer any of our common stock or other securities. Subject to certain limited exceptions, Nestle Health Science also agreed to a two-year standstill agreement under which Nestle Health Science agreed not to acquire us through any means. We agreed to register the resale of the shares that Nestle Health Science purchased on a registration statement to be filed with the SEC upon the request of Nestle Health Science, which cannot make the request prior to the 45th day preceding the end of the market standoff provision. The investment and the collaboration do not include any development milestones, product marketing rights or royalties.\nIn November 2018, we entered into an extension of the strategic collaboration on similar terms and issued and sold an additional 3,237,529 shares of our common stock in a private placement at a price of $30.27 per share for aggregate proceeds of $98.0 million, increasing Nestl\u00e9 Health Science's ownership of Aimmune to approximately 19%. The transaction documents include the extension of the registration rights, standstill rights and market standoff provisions. We are not subject to any partnership, collaboration, or negotiation restrictions under the extension agreements. In addition, we retain all rights to our current and future pipeline assets, and we and Nestl\u00e9 Health Science expect to continue to collaborate towards the successful development of such assets.\nThe initial investment launched a two-year strategic collaboration, which was extended for an additional two years in November 2018, between us and Nestle Health Science, the terms of which enable both parties to discuss our current and future oral immunotherapy development programs through a newly established pipeline forum. Nestle Health Science will provide ongoing scientific, regulatory, and commercial expertise and advice to us through the pipeline forum. Any information disclosed in the collaboration will remain our confidential information, and any new ideas or inventions that arise that relate to our products will be our solely owned intellectual property. If we elect to seek a partner or collaborator for one of our oral immunotherapy development programs during the two-year term of the collaboration, Nestle Health Science will have a three-month period to negotiate exclusively with us. During the term of the collaboration, and for so long as Nestle Health Science holds not less than ten percent of our outstanding common stock, Nestle Health Science will be entitled to designate one nominee to serve as a director on our Board of Directors. In November 2016, Greg Behar joined our Board of Directors on behalf of Nestle Health Science. The strategic collaboration agreement contains a non-competition covenant pursuant to which Nestle Health Science has agreed not to engage in certain activities relating to OIT for the treatment of food allergies.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAccrued Research and Development Costs\nWe record expenses for our research and development activities conducted by third-party service providers, which include the conduct of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and contract manufacturing activities, based upon the estimated amount of services provided and work completed but not yet invoiced and in accordance with agreements established with these third-party service providers. We include these costs in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. These costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses.\nWe estimate the amount of work completed through discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued balance in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accrued estimates. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed, the number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment may vary from our estimates and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. Our accrued expenses are dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from clinical research organizations and other third-party service providers. To date, there have been no material differences from our accrued expenses to actual expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees and directors based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. The fair value of ESPP is expensed over the purchase period, which is generally six months, on a straight-line basis.\nWe recorded stock-based compensation expense of $32.7 million, $16.7 million and $12.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIn determining the fair value of the stock-based awards used to calculate stock-based compensation expense, we use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and assumptions discussed below. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires judgment to determine.\nTable 274: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected Term. The expected term of stock-bases awards represents the weighted average period the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We have opted to use the simplified method for estimating the expected term as provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, 110 as our stock-based awards are considered plain vanilla\u201d. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. We plan to continue to use the simplified method under SAB 110 until we have sufficient exercise history as a publicly traded company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 275: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected Volatility. As we have limited trading history for our common stock, the expected stock price volatility assumption is determined based on the historical volatilities of a group of industry peers as well as the historical volatility of our own common stock since we began trading subsequent to our IPO in August 2015. Industry peers consist of several public companies in the biopharmaceutical industry with comparable characteristics including enterprise value, risk profiles and position within the industry. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 276: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the stock-based award.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 277: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected Dividend Yield. We have never paid dividends on our common stock and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock. Therefore, we used an expected dividend yield of zero for all years presented.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRestricted Stock Units, or RSUs are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant and recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the employee's requisite service period (generally the vesting period).\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and the resulting weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted were as follows:\nTable 278: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average grant date fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the Black-Scholes assumptions, we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the adequacy of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors. The impact from any forfeiture rate adjustment would be recognized in full in the period of adjustment, and if the actual number of future forfeitures differs from our estimates, we might be required to record adjustments to stock-based compensation in future periods. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected terms and forfeiture rates utilized for our stock-based compensation expense calculations on a prospective basis.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $52.2 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over an estimated weighted-average period of 2.5 years. For stock option awards subject to ratable vesting, we recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award. In future periods, our stock-based compensation expense is expected to increase as a result of recognizing our existing unrecognized stock-based compensation for awards that will vest and as we issue additional stock-based awards to attract and retain our employees.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe information required by this item is included in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe largest component of our total operating expenses has historically been our investment in research and development activities. Research and development expenses consist primarily of external-related expenses, employee-related expenses, stock-based compensation expense, and facilities and other costs, which include the following:\nTable 279: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> External-related expenses include costs incurred to conduct research, such as the discovery and development of our product candidates; costs related to the production of clinical supplies, including fees paid to contract manufacturers; fees paid to consultants and vendors, including clinical research organizations in conjunction with implementing and monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating clinical trial data, including all related fees, such as for investigator grants, patient screening fees, laboratory work and statistical compilation and analysis; costs for scientific conferences and meetings; and costs related to compliance with drug development regulatory requirements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 280: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Employee-related costs include salaries, bonuses, severance and benefits for personnel in our research and development functions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 281: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Stock-based compensation expense is expense associated with our equity plans for awards to personnel in our research and development functions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 282: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Facilities and other costs include facilities-related rent, depreciation and other allocable expenses, which include general and administrative support functions and general supplies for our research and development activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recognize all research and development expenses as they are incurred. Clinical trial, contract manufacturing and other development costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include employee-related costs, stock-based compensation expense, external professional services expenses, and facilities and other costs. Employee-related costs include salaries, bonuses, severance and benefits for personnel in our general and administrative functions. Stock-based compensation expense is expense associated with our equity plans for awards to personnel in our general and administrative functions. External professional services expenses consist of legal, accounting, and audit services and other consulting fees. Facilities and other costs consist of allocable expenses, including facilities-related rent and depreciation, from our facilities and information technology departments, which are allocated between research and development and general and administrative functions based on headcount.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nTable 283: <table> <tr>

to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to increased external clinical-related expenses, employee-related costs, stock-based compensation expense and facilities and other costs. External clinical-related costs increased primarily due to the progression of certain AR101 clinical trials, including RAMSES, ARC008, ARTEMIS and ARC011,the close-out of clinical trials, and higher contract manufacturing costs to support clinical development and regulatory activities. Employee-related costs and stock-based compensation expense increased primarily due to increased headcount to support continued development of AR101. Facilities and other costs increased primarily due to the allocation of higher facilities and information technology costs, which are allocable from general and administrative to research and development expenses based on headcount.\nWe expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in the near-term as our clinical trials related to the AR101 development program progress, as we advance our CODIT product candidates for the treatment of egg allergy and multi-nut allergy into clinical trials and as we develop additional CODIT product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses incurred during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 285: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employee-related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> External professional services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facilities and other costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (433\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 81,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to increased external professional services costs, stock-based compensation expense and employee-related costs. External professional services increased primarily due to consulting services for commercial planning, medical education and grants, and support for AR101. Stock-based compensation expense increased primarily due to the January 2018 issuance of restricted common stock in connection with the expansion and extension of our long-term commercial supply agreement with GPC and modification of certain executives' stock options resulting from their planned separation. Employee-related costs increased primarily due to increased headcount. The increased headcount was for additional administrative support for the continued buildout of our infrastructure to support the potential commercialization of AR101, including the establishment of key commercial functions such as marketing, market access and medical affairs.\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we continue to build our infrastructure, including the hiring of additional personnel, incur expenses related to commercial planning for AR101 and recognize expenses in connection with the vesting of the restricted common stock issued to GPC.\nInterest Income, net\nInterest income, net, increased by $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher average cash,

External professional services increased primarily due to consulting services for commercial planning and support for AR101. Stock-based compensation expense increased primarily due to increased headcount, higher valuation of stock options granted and the modification of the CEO's stock options resulting from the recent announcement of his retirement. Employee-related costs increased primarily due to increased headcount for additional administrative support as we continue to build infrastructure to support our clinical trials and potential commercialization of AR101. Facilities and other costs decreased primarily due to the allocation of higher facilities and information technology costs, which are allocable from general and administrative to research and development expenses based on headcount.\nInterest Income, net\nInterest income, net, increased by $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances during the period.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 is due to income tax expense generated from our foreign subsidiaries.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $303.9 million. We believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least the next 12 months and through expected regulatory approval of AR101 in the United States.\nIn November 2016, we and Nestle Health Science entered into the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we issued and sold 7,552,084 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, to Nestle Health Science for an aggregate cash purchase price of $145.0 million.\nIn February and March 2018, we issued and sold an aggregate of 6,325,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $32.00 per share, including the closing of the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional 825,000 shares of common stock. In addition, in November 2018, we sold an additional 3,237,529 shares of our common stock to Nestl\u00e9 Health Science at a price of $30.27 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $98.0 million.\nIn January 2019, we entered into a loan agreement with an affiliate of KKR for up to $170.0 million in three tranches. Of the total loan amount, $40.0 million was funded upon the closing of the transaction, with $85.0 million to be funded upon FDA approval of AR101 and satisfaction of other customary borrowing conditions, and $45.0 million to be made available at our option in 2020 upon the satisfaction of certain borrowing conditions. The loan can be prepaid at our discretion, at any time, subject to prepayment fees. The weighted-average interest rate will be calculated based on the daily cost of borrowing, reflecting the relevant adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, or Alternate Base Rate, or ABR plus the applicable margin. We have the option to elect to make interest payments from available funds or make interest payments in kind by capitalizing such interest amounts on the applicable interest payment date by adding the amounts to the outstanding principal amount of the loan. Any capitalized amounts shall thereafter bear interest. The Company has selected to pay in kind and have the interest capitalized for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019.\nWe do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development of, obtain regulatory approval for, and begin to commercialize one or more of our product candidates, which is subject to significant uncertainty. If our BLA for AR101 receives expedited review and we receive approval of a BLA for AR101 in-line with our current expected timing, we would expect to be able to commence commercial sales of AR101 in the United States in the second half of 2019. However, we may not receive expedited review of our AR101 BLA from the FDA, notwithstanding our receipt of Breakthrough Therapy designation for AR101, in which case our ability to commence commercial sales of AR101 in the United States maybe delayed. Even if we are able to commence commercial sales in 2019, we may need to raise additional capital to fund our future operations. Until such time that we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operating activities through a combination of equity offerings and debt financings and we may seek to raise additional capital through strategic collaborations. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our development programs or commercialization efforts or grant to others rights to develop or market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Failure to receive additional funding could cause us to cease operations, in part or in full. Furthermore, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations.\nSummary Statement of Cash Flows\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nTable 289: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (169,128\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (99,605\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (69,523\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (96,010\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (138,572\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 299,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 292,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (50,523\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 84,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used In Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $169.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $69.5 million from $99.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section of this Annual Report of on Form 10-K titled Risk Factors.\u201d Except as may be required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements or the reasons that results could differ from these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company advancing a new therapeutic approach, including the development of proprietary product candidates, for the treatment of peanut and other food allergies. It is estimated that over 30 million people in the United States and Europe have a food allergy, with peanut allergy being the most prevalent and most commonly associated with severe outcomes and life-threatening events. There are currently no approved medical therapies to cure food allergies or prevent their symptoms. Patients with food allergies are typically counseled to practice strict dietary avoidance. When accidental exposure to food allergens invokes a serious allergic reaction, rescue therapies, such as antihistamines or injectable epinephrine, are the only recourse available. Our therapeutic approach, which we refer to as Characterized Oral Desensitization ImmunoTherapy, or CODITTM, is designed to desensitize patients to food allergens and thereby reduce the risk of having an allergic reaction upon accidental exposure or reduce symptom severity should an allergic reaction occur. CODIT is intended to reduce meaningfully the burden and anxiety experienced by food-allergic patients and their families.\nOur lead CODIT product candidate, AR101, is an investigational biologic for the treatment of patients with peanut allergy, which affects approximately three million patients in the United States and three million patients in Europe. AR101 has received Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designations for the treatment of patients 4-17 years of age from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. In February 2018, we announced positive data from our Phase 3 efficacy trial of AR101 in the United States, Canada and Europe, which we refer to as the PALISADE (Peanut Allergy Oral Immunotherapy Study of AR101 for Desensitization in Children and Adults) trial. In November 2018, we announced positive topline results real-world experience safety trial of AR101 in the United States and Canada in patients ages 4-17, which we refer to as the RAMSES (Real-World AR101 Market-Supporting Experience Study in Peanut Allergic Children Ages 4-17 Years) trial. In addition, we have two ongoing roll-over studies relating to the PALISADE and RAMSES trials.\nWe filed a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for AR101 with the FDA, in December 2018. The FDA initiated review of the BLA for AR101 in January 2019, and we expect that the FDA will determine whether the BLA has been accepted for filing by the end of March 2019. The FDA has made an initial determination that AR101, as an allergenic product candidate, is exempt from the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, or PDUFA. We are not aware of any instances in which the BLA for a product candidate that had been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation was reviewed by the FDA pursuant to processes and timelines not governed by PDUFA and, as a result, there is uncertainty as to whether the AR101 BLA will receive an expedited review typically granted to product candidates with such designation. However, we believe the FDA has had policies that pre-date and post-date PDUFA that would allow for expedited review of PDUFA-exempt applications, and we are currently engaged in discussions with the FDA regarding the review timeline for the AR101 BLA. If the Breakthrough Therapy designation for AR101 does not result in an expedited review of the BLA for AR101, the BLA will likely be reviewed under a twelve-month review period applicable to PDUFA-exempt applications. Our initial target patient population for AR101 is children and adolescents in the 4-17 age group with a diagnosed peanut allergy, which we estimate reached approximately 1.6 million patients in the United States alone during 2018.\nIn February 2018, we completed enrollment of 175 patients in our European Phase 3 efficacy trial designed with a higher efficacy bar of tolerating 1,000 mg of peanut protein in an exit food-challenge without anything more than mild, transient symptoms, which we refer to as the ARTEMIS (AR101 Trial in Europe Measuring Oral Immunotherapy Success or ARC008) trial. Treatment of all patients in this trial is now complete and we expect to report preliminary summary data from the trial in the first half of 2019.\nWe expect to submit a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in the first half of 2019. We maintain worldwide commercial rights to all of our product candidates, including AR101 and, if approved, currently intend to commercialize in the United States and Europe by developing a specialty sales force targeting a subset of the approximately 5,000 practicing allergists in the United States and allergy-focused clinicians in major European markets.\nWe are in the process of developing formulations for additional CODIT product candidates beyond peanut allergy and has formulation and manufacturing activities ongoing for a product candidate designed to treat egg allergy, AR201 and are exploring a product candidate designed to treat multi-nut allergy, including walnut allergy. Review of our investigational new drug application, or IND, for AR201 was completed by the FDA in February 2019. As such, we have been cleared to advance AR201 into a Phase 2 clinical trial, which we expect to commence in mid-2019. In addition, we are also conducting research and development activities for potential CODIT product candidates targeting other food allergies, including cow's milk allergy.\nWe maintain worldwide commercial rights to all of our product candidates, including AR101 and, if any of our product candidates are approved, we currently intend to commercialize in the United States and Europe by developing a specialty sales force targeting a subset of the approximately 5,000 practicing allergists in the United States and allergy-focused clinicians in major European markets.\nSince commencing our operations in 2011, substantially all our efforts have been focused on research, development and AR101. We have not generated any revenue from product sales and, as a result, we have incurred significant losses. We incurred net losses of $210.8 million, $131.3 million and $80.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and used $169.1 million of cash in operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our accumulated deficit was $476.2 million. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we anticipate these losses will increase as we continue our development of, seek regulatory approval for, and begin to commercialize AR101, and as we develop other product candidates.\nIn February and March 2018, we issued and sold an aggregate of 6,325,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $32.00 per share, including the closing of the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional 825,000 shares of common stock. In addition, in November 2018, we sold an additional 3,237,529 shares of our common stock to Nestl\u00e9 Health Science at a price of $30.27 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $98.0 million.\nIn January 2019, we entered into a loan agreement with an affiliate of KKR for up to $170.0 million in three tranches. Of the total loan amount, $40.0 million was funded upon the closing of the transaction, with $85.0 million to be funded upon FDA approval of AR101 and satisfaction of other customary borrowing conditions, and $45.0 million to be made available at our option in 2020, upon the satisfaction of certain borrowing conditions.\nWe currently utilize contract manufacturers for all our manufacturing activities. In June 2015, we entered into a lease for a manufacturing facility in Clearwater, Florida. In June 2017, we completed the construction of the manufacturing facility within the leased building, which we intend to handle full-scale cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practices) commercial production of AR101, if approved, and supply future clinical trials of AR101. This manufacturing facility became operational in November 2018. We plan to continue to rely on the contract manufacturer that is located at the same site to manage the operations of this new manufacturing facility. Additionally, we currently utilize specialized clinical vendors, clinical trial sites, consultants, and clinical research organizations, or CROs, to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials, and we do not yet have a sales organization. We expect to continue to significantly increase our investment in our manufacturing process and commercial organization as we prepare for the filing of a MAA with the EMA and prepare for the potential approval of our BLA for AR101 in the United States and commercial launch of AR101.\nCredit Agreement with KKR\nIn January 2019, we entered into a Credit Agreement with KKR Peanut Aggregator L.P., an affiliate of KKR LLC, which we refer to, together with the several banks and other financial institutions from time to time party to the Credit Agreement, collectively as the Lenders, and Cortland Capital Market Services LLC, as the administrative agent and the collateral agent, or Agent. The Credit Agreement consists of a six-year term loan facility for an up to aggregate principal amount of $170.0 million, which we refer to as the Term Loans. The Credit Agreement provides for an initial Term Loan of $40.0 million, which was funded in January 2019. Subject to the fulfillment of certain customary conditions precedent, including the issuance of an approval letter by the FDA with respect to a AR101 BLA on or prior to December 31, 2020, we must draw an additional $85.0 million of the Term Loans. At our option and, subject to the fulfillment of customary conditions precedent, including our achievement of aggregate net sales (as defined in the agreement) for AR101 by July 31, 2020 in an amount of at least $30.0 million, we may draw the remaining $45.0 million of the Term Loans. The Term Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest through maturity, at our election, with respect to (a) ABR Loans, 6.50% per annum and (b) LIBOR Loans, 7.50% per annum. We will begin paying accrued interest on outstanding Term Loans on March 31, 2019, and on the last business day of each March, June, September and December thereafter while any Term Loan is outstanding, as well as on the final maturity date of the Term Loans. For each interest payment date until and including the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2020, we have the option to elect whether the interest payments due on such interest payment date shall be paid in cash or paid in kind and capitalized. We have selected to pay in kind and have the interest capitalized for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019.\nPrincipal payments on the Term Loans are paid according to the following schedule: (i) on December 31, 2023, 50.0% of the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans as of such date, including any capitalized interest, (ii) on each interest payment date thereafter, 12.5% of the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans as of December 31, 2023 and (iii) on January 3, 2025, any remaining outstanding balance of the Term Loans. We are also required to make mandatory prepayments of the Term Loans under the Credit Agreement, subject to specified exceptions, with the proceeds of asset sales, debt issuances, royalty transactions, collaboration transactions, and specified other events. In addition, upon the occurrence of a change of control, we must prepay, the outstanding amount of the Term Loans.\nIf all or any of the Term Loans are prepaid or required to be prepaid under the Credit Agreement, then we will pay, in addition to such prepayment, a prepayment premium equal to (i) with respect to any such prepayment paid on or prior to January 3, 2021, the amount, if any, by which (a) the present value as of such date of determination of (x) 105.00% of the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid plus (y) all required interest payments that would have been due on the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid through and including January 3, 2021, computed using a discount rate equal to the treasury rate most nearly equal to the period from such date of prepayment to January 3, 2021 plus 50 basis points exceeds (b) the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid, (ii) with respect to any prepayment paid or required to be paid after January 3, 2021 but on or prior to January 3, 2022, 5.00% of the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid, (iii) with respect to any prepayment paid or required to be paid after January 3, 2022 but on or prior to January 3, 2023, 2.00% of the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid and (iv) with respect to any prepayment paid or required to be prepaid thereafter, 0.00% of the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid. If we receive an approval letter by the FDA with respect to a AR101 BLA on or prior to December 31, 2020, we must pay on the earlier of (i) the date on which commitments have been terminated and no Term Loans are outstanding and (ii) the Interest Payment Date falling in the first full fiscal quarter after receipt of such regulatory approval, a premium in an amount equal to $3.4 million and the prepayment premium for such date on a principal amount equal to $85.0 million. The premium with respect to the regulatory approval described in the immediately preceding sentence is not due if we draw the additional (after the first $40.00 million) $85.0 million of the Term Loans.\nUpon the prepayment or repayment of all or any of the Term Loans, we will pay an additional (in addition to the prepayment premium) exit fee in an amount equal to 4.00% of the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid or repaid. In addition, we paid certain customary fees and expenses to the Agent and other service providers upon the closing of the transaction.\nThe obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of our tangible and intangible property. The Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default, including, covenants and restrictions that among other things, require us and our subsidiary guarantors to satisfy a minimum cash balance covenant and restricts our ability and each of our subsidiaries' ability to incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, make loans and investments, engage in mergers and acquisitions, engage in asset sales or sale and leaseback transactions, and declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock. A failure to comply with these covenants could permit the Lenders under the Credit Agreement to declare the Term Loans, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable.\nCollaboration with Nestle Health Science\nIn November 2016, we entered into a two-year strategic collaboration with an affiliate of Nestle Health Science US Holdings, Inc. for the advancement of food allergy therapeutics and issued and sold to Nestle Health Science US Holdings, Inc. (together with its affiliate, Nestle Health Science) 7,552,084 shares of common stock in a private placement at a price of $19.20 per share, which represented approximately 15.1% of our outstanding shares at the time of the transaction. Subject to certain limited exceptions, Nestle Health Science agreed to a two-year market standoff provision under which it agreed not to sell or transfer any of our common stock or other securities. Subject to certain limited exceptions, Nestle Health Science also agreed to a two-year standstill agreement under which Nestle Health Science agreed not to acquire us through any means. We agreed to register the resale of the shares that Nestle Health Science purchased on a registration statement to be filed with the SEC upon the request of Nestle Health Science, which cannot make the request prior to the 45th day preceding the end of the market standoff provision. The investment and the collaboration do not include any development milestones, product marketing rights or royalties.\nIn November 2018, we entered into an extension of the strategic collaboration on similar terms and issued and sold an additional 3,237,529 shares of our common stock in a private placement at a price of $30.27 per share for aggregate proceeds of $98.0 million, increasing Nestl\u00e9 Health Science's ownership of Aimmune to approximately 19%. The transaction documents include the extension of the registration rights, standstill rights and market standoff provisions. We are not subject to any partnership, collaboration, or negotiation restrictions under the extension agreements. In addition, we retain all rights to our current and future pipeline assets, and we and Nestl\u00e9 Health Science expect to continue to collaborate towards the successful development of such assets.\nThe initial investment launched a two-year strategic collaboration, which was extended for an additional two years in November 2018, between us and Nestle Health Science, the terms of which enable both parties to discuss our current and future oral immunotherapy development programs through a newly established pipeline forum. Nestle Health Science will provide ongoing scientific, regulatory, and commercial expertise and advice to us through the pipeline forum. Any information disclosed in the collaboration will remain our confidential information, and any new ideas or inventions that arise that relate to our products will be our solely owned intellectual property. If we elect to seek a partner or collaborator for one of our oral immunotherapy development programs during the two-year term of the collaboration, Nestle Health Science will have a three-month period to negotiate exclusively with us. During the term of the collaboration, and for so long as Nestle Health Science holds not less than ten percent of our outstanding common stock, Nestle Health Science will be entitled to designate one nominee to serve as a director on our Board of Directors. In November 2016, Greg Behar joined our Board of Directors on behalf of Nestle Health Science. The strategic collaboration agreement contains a non-competition covenant pursuant to which Nestle Health Science has agreed not to engage in certain activities relating to OIT for the treatment of food allergies.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAccrued Research and Development Costs\nWe record expenses for our research and development activities conducted by third-party service providers, which include the conduct of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and contract manufacturing activities, based upon the estimated amount of services provided and work completed but not yet invoiced and in accordance with agreements established with these third-party service providers. We include these costs in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. These costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses.\nWe estimate the amount of work completed through discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued balance in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accrued estimates. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed, the number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment may vary from our estimates and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. Our accrued expenses are dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from clinical research organizations and other third-party service providers. To date, there have been no material differences from our accrued expenses to actual expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees and directors based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. The fair value of ESPP is expensed over the purchase period, which is generally six months, on a straight-line basis.\nWe recorded stock-based compensation expense of $32.7 million, $16.7 million and $12.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIn determining the fair value of the stock-based awards used to calculate stock-based compensation expense, we use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and assumptions discussed below. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires judgment to determine.\n \u2022 Expected Term. The expected term of stock-bases awards represents the weighted average period the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We have opted to use the simplified method for estimating the expected term as provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, 110 as our stock-based awards are considered plain vanilla\u201d. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. We plan to continue to use the simplified method under SAB 110 until we have sufficient exercise history as a publicly traded company. \n \u2022 Expected Volatility. As we have limited trading history for our common stock, the expected stock price volatility assumption is determined based on the historical volatilities of a group of industry peers as well as the historical volatility of our own common stock since we began trading subsequent to our IPO in August 2015. Industry peers consist of several public companies in the biopharmaceutical industry with comparable characteristics including enterprise value, risk profiles and position within the industry. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation. \n \u2022 Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the stock-based award. \n \u2022 Expected Dividend Yield. We have never paid dividends on our common stock and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock. Therefore, we used an expected dividend yield of zero for all years presented. \nRestricted Stock Units, or RSUs are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant and recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the employee's requisite service period (generally the vesting period).\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and the resulting weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted were as follows:\n\nIn addition to the Black-Scholes assumptions, we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the adequacy of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors. The impact from any forfeiture rate adjustment would be recognized in full in the period of adjustment, and if the actual number of future forfeitures differs from our estimates, we might be required to record adjustments to stock-based compensation in future periods. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected terms and forfeiture rates utilized for our stock-based compensation expense calculations on a prospective basis.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $52.2 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over an estimated weighted-average period of 2.5 years. For stock option awards subject to ratable vesting, we recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award. In future periods, our stock-based compensation expense is expected to increase as a result of recognizing our existing unrecognized stock-based compensation for awards that will vest and as we issue additional stock-based awards to attract and retain our employees.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe information required by this item is included in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe largest component of our total operating expenses has historically been our investment in research and development activities. Research and development expenses consist primarily of external-related expenses, employee-related expenses, stock-based compensation expense, and facilities and other costs, which include the following:\n \u2022 External-related expenses include costs incurred to conduct research, such as the discovery and development of our product candidates; costs related to the production of clinical supplies, including fees paid to contract manufacturers; fees paid to consultants and vendors, including clinical research organizations in conjunction with implementing and monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating clinical trial data, including all related fees, such as for investigator grants, patient screening fees, laboratory work and statistical compilation and analysis; costs for scientific conferences and meetings; and costs related to compliance with drug development regulatory requirements. \n \u2022 Employee-related costs include salaries, bonuses, severance and benefits for personnel in our research and development functions. \n \u2022 Stock-based compensation expense is expense associated with our equity plans for awards to personnel in our research and development functions. \n \u2022 Facilities and other costs include facilities-related rent, depreciation and other allocable expenses, which include general and administrative support functions and general supplies for our research and development activities. \nWe recognize all research and development expenses as they are incurred. Clinical trial, contract manufacturing and other development costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include employee-related costs, stock-based compensation expense, external professional services expenses, and facilities and other costs. Employee-related costs include salaries, bonuses, severance and benefits for personnel in our general and administrative functions. Stock-based compensation expense is expense associated with our equity plans for awards to personnel in our general and administrative functions. External professional services expenses consist of legal, accounting, and audit services and other consulting fees. Facilities and other costs consist of allocable expenses, including facilities-related rent and depreciation, from our facilities and information technology departments, which are allocated between research and development and general and administrative functions based on headcount.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section of this Annual Report of on Form 10-K titled Risk Factors.\u201d Except as may be required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements or the reasons that results could differ from these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company advancing a new therapeutic approach, including the development of proprietary product candidates, for the treatment of peanut and other food allergies. It is estimated that over 30 million people in the United States and Europe have a food allergy, with peanut allergy being the most prevalent and most commonly associated with severe outcomes and life-threatening events. There are currently no approved medical therapies to cure food allergies or prevent their symptoms. Patients with food allergies are typically counseled to practice strict dietary avoidance. When accidental exposure to food allergens invokes a serious allergic reaction, rescue therapies, such as antihistamines or injectable epinephrine, are the only recourse available. Our therapeutic approach, which we refer to as Characterized Oral Desensitization ImmunoTherapy, or CODITTM, is designed to desensitize patients to food allergens and thereby reduce the risk of having an allergic reaction upon accidental exposure or reduce symptom severity should an allergic reaction occur. CODIT is intended to reduce meaningfully the burden and anxiety experienced by food-allergic patients and their families.\nOur lead CODIT product candidate, AR101, is an investigational biologic for the treatment of patients with peanut allergy, which affects approximately three million patients in the United States and three million patients in Europe. AR101 has received Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designations for the treatment of patients 4-17 years of age from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. In February 2018, we announced positive data from our Phase 3 efficacy trial of AR101 in the United States, Canada and Europe, which we refer to as the PALISADE (Peanut Allergy Oral Immunotherapy Study of AR101 for Desensitization in Children and Adults) trial. In November 2018, we announced positive topline results real-world experience safety trial of AR101 in the United States and Canada in patients ages 4-17, which we refer to as the RAMSES (Real-World AR101 Market-Supporting Experience Study in Peanut Allergic Children Ages 4-17 Years) trial. In addition, we have two ongoing roll-over studies relating to the PALISADE and RAMSES trials.\nWe filed a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for AR101 with the FDA, in December 2018. The FDA initiated review of the BLA for AR101 in January 2019, and we expect that the FDA will determine whether the BLA has been accepted for filing by the end of March 2019. The FDA has made an initial determination that AR101, as an allergenic product candidate, is exempt from the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, or PDUFA. We are not aware of any instances in which the BLA for a product candidate that had been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation was reviewed by the FDA pursuant to processes and timelines not governed by PDUFA and, as a result, there is uncertainty as to whether the AR101 BLA will receive an expedited review typically granted to product candidates with such designation. However, we believe the FDA has had policies that pre-date and post-date PDUFA that would allow for expedited review of PDUFA-exempt applications, and we are currently engaged in discussions with the FDA regarding the review timeline for the AR101 BLA. If the Breakthrough Therapy designation for AR101 does not result in an expedited review of the BLA for AR101, the BLA will likely be reviewed under a twelve-month review period applicable to PDUFA-exempt applications. Our initial target patient population for AR101 is children and adolescents in the 4-17 age group with a diagnosed peanut allergy, which we estimate reached approximately 1.6 million patients in the United States alone during 2018.\nIn February 2018, we completed enrollment of 175 patients in our European Phase 3 efficacy trial designed with a higher efficacy bar of tolerating 1,000 mg of peanut protein in an exit food-challenge without anything more than mild, transient symptoms, which we refer to as the ARTEMIS (AR101 Trial in Europe Measuring Oral Immunotherapy Success or ARC008) trial. Treatment of all patients in this trial is now complete and we expect to report preliminary summary data from the trial in the first half of 2019.\nWe expect to submit a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in the first half of 2019. We maintain worldwide commercial rights to all of our product candidates, including AR101 and, if approved, currently intend to commercialize in the United States and Europe by developing a specialty sales force targeting a subset of the approximately 5,000 practicing allergists in the United States and allergy-focused clinicians in major European markets.\nWe are in the process of developing formulations for additional CODIT product candidates beyond peanut allergy and has formulation and manufacturing activities ongoing for a product candidate designed to treat egg allergy, AR201 and are exploring a product candidate designed to treat multi-nut allergy, including walnut allergy. Review of our investigational new drug application, or IND, for AR201 was completed by the FDA in February 2019. As such, we have been cleared to advance AR201 into a Phase 2 clinical trial, which we expect to commence in mid-2019. In addition, we are also conducting research and development activities for potential CODIT product candidates targeting other food allergies, including cow's milk allergy.\nWe maintain worldwide commercial rights to all of our product candidates, including AR101 and, if any of our product candidates are approved, we currently intend to commercialize in the United States and Europe by developing a specialty sales force targeting a subset of the approximately 5,000 practicing allergists in the United States and allergy-focused clinicians in major European markets.\nSince commencing our operations in 2011, substantially all our efforts have been focused on research, development and AR101. We have not generated any revenue from product sales and, as a result, we have incurred significant losses. We incurred net losses of $210.8 million, $131.3 million and $80.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and used $169.1 million of cash in operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our accumulated deficit was $476.2 million. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we anticipate these losses will increase as we continue our development of, seek regulatory approval for, and begin to commercialize AR101, and as we develop other product candidates.\nIn February and March 2018, we issued and sold an aggregate of 6,325,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $32.00 per share, including the closing of the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional 825,000 shares of common stock. In addition, in November 2018, we sold an additional 3,237,529 shares of our common stock to Nestl\u00e9 Health Science at a price of $30.27 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $98.0 million.\nIn January 2019, we entered into a loan agreement with an affiliate of KKR for up to $170.0 million in three tranches. Of the total loan amount, $40.0 million was funded upon the closing of the transaction, with $85.0 million to be funded upon FDA approval of AR101 and satisfaction of other customary borrowing conditions, and $45.0 million to be made available at our option in 2020, upon the satisfaction of certain borrowing conditions.\nWe currently utilize contract manufacturers for all our manufacturing activities. In June 2015, we entered into a lease for a manufacturing facility in Clearwater, Florida. In June 2017, we completed the construction of the manufacturing facility within the leased building, which we intend to handle full-scale cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practices) commercial production of AR101, if approved, and supply future clinical trials of AR101. This manufacturing facility became operational in November 2018. We plan to continue to rely on the contract manufacturer that is located at the same site to manage the operations of this new manufacturing facility. Additionally, we currently utilize specialized clinical vendors, clinical trial sites, consultants, and clinical research organizations, or CROs, to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials, and we do not yet have a sales organization. We expect to continue to significantly increase our investment in our manufacturing process and commercial organization as we prepare for the filing of a MAA with the EMA and prepare for the potential approval of our BLA for AR101 in the United States and commercial launch of AR101.\nCredit Agreement with KKR\nIn January 2019, we entered into a Credit Agreement with KKR Peanut Aggregator L.P., an affiliate of KKR LLC, which we refer to, together with the several banks and other financial institutions from time to time party to the Credit Agreement, collectively as the Lenders, and Cortland Capital Market Services LLC, as the administrative agent and the collateral agent, or Agent. The Credit Agreement consists of a six-year term loan facility for an up to aggregate principal amount of $170.0 million, which we refer to as the Term Loans. The Credit Agreement provides for an initial Term Loan of $40.0 million, which was funded in January 2019. Subject to the fulfillment of certain customary conditions precedent, including the issuance of an approval letter by the FDA with respect to a AR101 BLA on or prior to December 31, 2020, we must draw an additional $85.0 million of the Term Loans. At our option and, subject to the fulfillment of customary conditions precedent, including our achievement of aggregate net sales (as defined in the agreement) for AR101 by July 31, 2020 in an amount of at least $30.0 million, we may draw the remaining $45.0 million of the Term Loans. The Term Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest through maturity, at our election, with respect to (a) ABR Loans, 6.50% per annum and (b) LIBOR Loans, 7.50% per annum. We will begin paying accrued interest on outstanding Term Loans on March 31, 2019, and on the last business day of each March, June, September and December thereafter while any Term Loan is outstanding, as well as on the final maturity date of the Term Loans. For each interest payment date until and including the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2020, we have the option to elect whether the interest payments due on such interest payment date shall be paid in cash or paid in kind and capitalized. We have selected to pay in kind and have the interest capitalized for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019.\nPrincipal payments on the Term Loans are paid according to the following schedule: (i) on December 31, 2023, 50.0% of the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans as of such date, including any capitalized interest, (ii) on each interest payment date thereafter, 12.5% of the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans as of December 31, 2023 and (iii) on January 3, 2025, any remaining outstanding balance of the Term Loans. We are also required to make mandatory prepayments of the Term Loans under the Credit Agreement, subject to specified exceptions, with the proceeds of asset sales, debt issuances, royalty transactions, collaboration transactions, and specified other events. In addition, upon the occurrence of a change of control, we must prepay, the outstanding amount of the Term Loans.\nIf all or any of the Term Loans are prepaid or required to be prepaid under the Credit Agreement, then we will pay, in addition to such prepayment, a prepayment premium equal to (i) with respect to any such prepayment paid on or prior to January 3, 2021, the amount, if any, by which (a) the present value as of such date of determination of (x) 105.00% of the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid plus (y) all required interest payments that would have been due on the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid through and including January 3, 2021, computed using a discount rate equal to the treasury rate most nearly equal to the period from such date of prepayment to January 3, 2021 plus 50 basis points exceeds (b) the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid, (ii) with respect to any prepayment paid or required to be paid after January 3, 2021 but on or prior to January 3, 2022, 5.00% of the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid, (iii) with respect to any prepayment paid or required to be paid after January 3, 2022 but on or prior to January 3, 2023, 2.00% of the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid and (iv) with respect to any prepayment paid or required to be prepaid thereafter, 0.00% of the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid. If we receive an approval letter by the FDA with respect to a AR101 BLA on or prior to December 31, 2020, we must pay on the earlier of (i) the date on which commitments have been terminated and no Term Loans are outstanding and (ii) the Interest Payment Date falling in the first full fiscal quarter after receipt of such regulatory approval, a premium in an amount equal to $3.4 million and the prepayment premium for such date on a principal amount equal to $85.0 million. The premium with respect to the regulatory approval described in the immediately preceding sentence is not due if we draw the additional (after the first $40.00 million) $85.0 million of the Term Loans.\nUpon the prepayment or repayment of all or any of the Term Loans, we will pay an additional (in addition to the prepayment premium) exit fee in an amount equal to 4.00% of the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid or repaid. In addition, we paid certain customary fees and expenses to the Agent and other service providers upon the closing of the transaction.\nThe obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of our tangible and intangible property. The Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default, including, covenants and restrictions that among other things, require us and our subsidiary guarantors to satisfy a minimum cash balance covenant and restricts our ability and each of our subsidiaries' ability to incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, make loans and investments, engage in mergers and acquisitions, engage in asset sales or sale and leaseback transactions, and declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock. A failure to comply with these covenants could permit the Lenders under the Credit Agreement to declare the Term Loans, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable.\nCollaboration with Nestle Health Science\nIn November 2016, we entered into a two-year strategic collaboration with an affiliate of Nestle Health Science US Holdings, Inc. for the advancement of food allergy therapeutics and issued and sold to Nestle Health Science US Holdings, Inc. (together with its affiliate, Nestle Health Science) 7,552,084 shares of common stock in a private placement at a price of $19.20 per share, which represented approximately 15.1% of our outstanding shares at the time of the transaction. Subject to certain limited exceptions, Nestle Health Science agreed to a two-year market standoff provision under which it agreed not to sell or transfer any of our common stock or other securities. Subject to certain limited exceptions, Nestle Health Science also agreed to a two-year standstill agreement under which Nestle Health Science agreed not to acquire us through any means. We agreed to register the resale of the shares that Nestle Health Science purchased on a registration statement to be filed with the SEC upon the request of Nestle Health Science, which cannot make the request prior to the 45th day preceding the end of the market standoff provision. The investment and the collaboration do not include any development milestones, product marketing rights or royalties.\nIn November 2018, we entered into an extension of the strategic collaboration on similar terms and issued and sold an additional 3,237,529 shares of our common stock in a private placement at a price of $30.27 per share for aggregate proceeds of $98.0 million, increasing Nestl\u00e9 Health Science's ownership of Aimmune to approximately 19%. The transaction documents include the extension of the registration rights, standstill rights and market standoff provisions. We are not subject to any partnership, collaboration, or negotiation restrictions under the extension agreements. In addition, we retain all rights to our current and future pipeline assets, and we and Nestl\u00e9 Health Science expect to continue to collaborate towards the successful development of such assets.\nThe initial investment launched a two-year strategic collaboration, which was extended for an additional two years in November 2018, between us and Nestle Health Science, the terms of which enable both parties to discuss our current and future oral immunotherapy development programs through a newly established pipeline forum. Nestle Health Science will provide ongoing scientific, regulatory, and commercial expertise and advice to us through the pipeline forum. Any information disclosed in the collaboration will remain our confidential information, and any new ideas or inventions that arise that relate to our products will be our solely owned intellectual property. If we elect to seek a partner or collaborator for one of our oral immunotherapy development programs during the two-year term of the collaboration, Nestle Health Science will have a three-month period to negotiate exclusively with us. During the term of the collaboration, and for so long as Nestle Health Science holds not less than ten percent of our outstanding common stock, Nestle Health Science will be entitled to designate one nominee to serve as a director on our Board of Directors. In November 2016, Greg Behar joined our Board of Directors on behalf of Nestle Health Science. The strategic collaboration agreement contains a non-competition covenant pursuant to which Nestle Health Science has agreed not to engage in certain activities relating to OIT for the treatment of food allergies.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods.

Therefore, we used an expected dividend yield of zero for all years presented. \nRestricted Stock Units, or RSUs are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant and recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the employee's requisite service period (generally the vesting period).\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and the resulting weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted were as follows:\nTable 278: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average grant date fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the Black-Scholes assumptions, we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the adequacy of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors. The impact from any forfeiture rate adjustment would be recognized in full in the period of adjustment, and if the actual number of future forfeitures differs from our estimates, we might be required to record adjustments to stock-based compensation in future periods. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected terms and forfeiture rates utilized for our stock-based compensation expense calculations on a prospective basis.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $52.2 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over an estimated weighted-average period of 2.5 years. For stock option awards subject to ratable vesting, we recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award. In future periods, our stock-based compensation expense is expected to increase as a result of recognizing our existing unrecognized stock-based compensation for awards that will vest and as we issue additional stock-based awards to attract and retain our employees.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe information required by this item is included in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe largest component of our total operating expenses has historically been our investment in research and development activities. Research and development expenses consist primarily of external-related expenses, employee-related expenses, stock-based compensation expense, and facilities and other costs, which include the following:\n \u2022 External-related expenses include costs incurred to conduct research, such as the discovery and development of our product candidates; costs related to the production of clinical supplies, including fees paid to contract manufacturers; fees paid to consultants and vendors, including clinical research organizations in conjunction with implementing and monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating clinical trial data, including all related fees, such as for investigator grants, patient screening fees, laboratory work and statistical compilation and analysis; costs for scientific conferences and meetings; and costs related to compliance with drug development regulatory requirements. \n \u2022 Employee-related costs include salaries, bonuses, severance and benefits for personnel in our research and development functions. \n \u2022 Stock-based compensation expense is expense associated with our equity plans for awards to personnel in our research and development functions. \n \u2022 Facilities and other costs include facilities-related rent, depreciation and other allocable expenses, which include general and administrative support functions and general supplies for our research and development activities. \nWe recognize all research and development expenses as they are incurred. Clinical trial, contract manufacturing and other development costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include employee-related costs, stock-based compensation expense, external professional services expenses, and facilities and other costs. Employee-related costs include salaries, bonuses, severance and benefits for personnel in our general and administrative functions. Stock-based compensation expense is expense associated with our equity plans for awards to personnel in our general and administrative functions. External professional services expenses consist of legal, accounting, and audit services and other consulting fees. Facilities and other costs consist of allocable expenses, including facilities-related rent and depreciation, from our facilities and information technology departments, which are allocated between research and development and general and administrative functions based on headcount.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nTable 283: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 133,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 89,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>"}
