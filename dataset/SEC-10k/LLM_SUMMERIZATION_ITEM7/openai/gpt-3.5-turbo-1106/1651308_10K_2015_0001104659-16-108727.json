Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with \u201cItem 6 - Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under \u201cPart I-Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d and under \u201cForward-Looking Statements and Market Data\u201d in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a globally focused, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to becoming a leader in the discovery and development of innovative, molecularly targeted and immuno-oncology drugs for the treatment of cancer. We believe the next generation of cancer treatment will utilize therapeutics both as monotherapy and in combination to attack multiple underlying mechanisms of cancer cell growth and survival. We further believe that discovery of next generation cancer therapies requires new research tools. To that end, we have developed a proprietary cancer biology platform that addresses the importance of tumor-immune system interactions and the value of primary biopsies in developing new models to support our drug discovery effort. Our strategy is to develop a pipeline of drug candidates with the potential to be best-in-class monotherapies and also important components of multiple-agent combination regimens.\nWe have used our cancer biology platform to develop four clinical-stage drug candidates that we believe have the potential to be best-in-class or first-in-class. In addition, we believe that each has the potential to be an important component of a drug combination addressing major unmet medical needs. Our clinical-stage drug candidates include three molecularly targeted agents, BGB-3111, BGB-290 and BGB-283 and one immuno-oncology agent, BGB-A317. BGB-3111 is a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of BTK. BGB-290 is a highly selective small molecule inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2. BGB-283 is a small molecule inhibitor of both the monomer and dimer forms of RAF. For each of our molecularly targeted drug candidates, we have achieved proof-of-concept by demonstrating objective responses in the defined patient populations. Our clinical-stage immuno-oncology agent, BGB-A317, is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the immune checkpoint receptor, PD-1. In addition to our clinical-stage drug candidates, we have a robust pipeline of preclinical programs and are planning to advance one or more of these programs into the clinic in the next 18 months. We have licensed the ex-China rights of BGB-283 to Merck KGaA. We retain full global rights for all of our other clinical and preclinical drug candidates and programs.\nSince our inception on October 28, 2010, our operations have focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials. We do not have any drug candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have financed operations through a combination of debt and equity financings and private and public grants and contracts, including the net proceeds from the issuance of a senior and convertible promissory note to Merck Sharp & Dohme Research GmbH, or MSD, an affiliate of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., the private placements of our Series A preferred shares and Series A-2 preferred shares, and our collaboration with Merck KGaA, or Merck KGaA Collaboration. From January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015, we raised an aggregate of $150.3 million of gross proceeds from sales of our preferred shares, and additionally received $18.0 million from the Merck KGaA Collaboration to fund our operations. At December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $100.5 million. Although it is difficult to predict our liquidity requirements, based upon our current operating plan and the successful completion of our initial public offering, we believe we have sufficient cash to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. See \u201c-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nSince inception we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $7.9 million, $18.5 million and $57.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $118.2 million. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from funding our research and development programs and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:\n\u00b7 continue investment in our cancer biology platform;\n\u00b7 continue preclinical and clinical development of our programs;\n\u00b7 continue investment in our manufacturing facilities;\n\u00b7 hire additional research, development and business personnel;\n\u00b7 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u00b7 incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future.\nWe have licensed BGB-283 to Merck KGaA for markets outside China, but we still own the worldwide rights to our other drug candidates and retain exclusive rights to BGB-283 in China. We also have a limited collaboration with Merck KGaA on BGB-290.\nOn May 24, 2013, we entered into license agreements with Merck KGaA, which we amended and restated on December 10, 2013, and further amended on October 1, 2015 and December 3, 2015, pursuant to which (1) we granted to Merck KGaA an exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property rights to develop and manufacture, and, if Merck KGaA exercises its continuation option, to commercialize and manufacture our compound BGB-283, and any other compound covered by the same existing patent rights with primary activity to inhibit wildtype or certain mutant BRAF, in all countries of the world excluding The People's Republic of China, which we refer to as the Ex-PRC Territory, and (2) Merck KGaA granted us an exclusive license under certain of its intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize the RAF dimer inhibitor in The People's Republic of China, which we refer to as the PRC Territory, subject to certain non-compete restrictions. Under these agreements, we received $13 million in non-refundable payments in 2013 following their execution, $5 million in milestone payment in 2014 and $4 million in milestone payment in 2015. We are eligible to receive up to $32 million, $33 million and $145 million in payments upon the successful achievement of pre-specified clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones in the Ex-PRC Territory, respectively, and another $14 million in payments upon the successful achievement of pre-specified clinical milestones in the PRC Territory. Merck KGaA also is required to pay us tiered royalties ranging from the mid single-digit to the low-teens, on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, on aggregate net sales of licensed products in the Ex-PRC Territory. In consideration for the licenses Merck KGaA grants to us, we are required to pay Merck KGaA a high single-digit royalty on aggregate net sales of Licensed BRAF inhibitors in the PRC Territory.\nOn October 28, 2013, we entered into license agreements with Merck KGaA, pursuant to which (1) we granted to Merck KGaA an exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property rights to develop and manufacture, and, if Merck KGaA exercises a certain continuation option, to commercialize and manufacture our compound BGB-290 and any other compound covered by the same existing patent rights with primary activity to inhibit PARP 1, 2 or 3 enzymes in the Ex-PRC Territory, and (2) Merck KGaA granted us an exclusive license under certain of its intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize the licensed PARP inhibitors in the PRC Territory. Under these license agreements, we received $6 million in non-refundable payments in November 2013 following their execution and $9 million in milestone payments in 2014. We are eligible to receive up to $7 million and $2.5 million, in payments upon the successful achievement of pre-specified clinical and regulatory milestones in the PRC Territory respectively. On October 1, 2015, pursuant to a purchase of rights agreement, we repurchased all of Merck KGaA's worldwide rights under the ex-PRC license agreement, in consideration for, among other things, a one-time payment of $10 million and reduction of future milestone payments that we are eligible to receive under the PRC license agreement. In connection with such repurchase, the ex-PRC license agreement terminated except for certain provisions therein. The remaining $3 million of deferred revenue related to PARP as of October 1, 2015 was netted against the $10 million repurchase consideration. In addition, if Merck KGaA exercises its PRC commercialization option, as further described in the section of this Annual Report titled \u201cPart I-Item 1 - Business-Collaboration with\nMerck KGaA,\u201d Merck KGaA is required to pay us a $50 million non-refundable payment upon such exercise, and we are eligible for a $12.5 million milestone payment upon the successful achievement of a certain additional regulatory event in the PRC Territory. In consideration for the licenses granted to us, we are required to pay Merck KGaA a high single-digit royalty on aggregate net sales of licensed products in the PRC Territory.\nFor more information on our collaborations with Merck KGaA, see \u201cPart I-Item 1 - Business-Collaboration with Merck KGaA.\u201d\nWe recognized $11.1 million, $13.0 million and $8.8 million of collaboration revenue from the Merck KGaA Collaboration for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. The following table summarizes the revenue recognition schedule of an aggregate of $34.0 million in revenue from our collaboration agreements with Merck KGaA, comprised of an aggregate of $22.0 million related to BGB-283 and $12.0 million related to BGB-290. The revenue consists of an upfront non-refundable license fee, Phase 1 research and development fees, and a development based target payment related to the collaborative arrangements for BRAF, excluding the $3 million in deferred revenue that was netted against the $10 million repurchase consideration relating to the PARP inhibitors under the ex-PRC license agreement. In accordance with our revenue recognition policy, we recognize these amounts as shown in the table below:\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> BGB-283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> BGB-290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 8,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 2,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 11,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 22,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 11,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 33,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, substantially all of our revenue were generated solely from Merck KGaA. For the foreseeable future, we expect substantially all of our revenue will be generated from the Merck KGaA Collaboration, and any other strategic relationships we may enter into. If our development efforts are successful, we may also generate revenue from product sales.\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of the costs associated with our research and development activities, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and activities related to regulatory filings. Our research and development expenses consist of:\n\u00b7 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and share-based compensation expense for research and development personnel;\n\u00b7 expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, contract manufacturing organizations, and consultants that conduct and support clinical trials and preclinical studies;\n\u00b7 costs associated with preclinical activities and development activities;\n\u00b7 costs associated with regulatory operations; and\n\u00b7 other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies used in research and development activities.\nOur current research and development activities mainly relate to the clinical development of the following programs:\n\u00b7 BGB-3111, a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of BTK;\n\u00b7 BGB-A317, a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1;\n\u00b7 BGB-290, a highly selective small molecule inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2; and\n\u00b7 BGB-283, a small molecule inhibitor of both the monomer and dimer forms of BRAF.\nWe expense research and development costs when we incur them. We record costs for some development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information our vendors provide to us. We do not allocate employee-related costs, depreciation, rental and other indirect costs to specific research and development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product programs under research and development and, as such, are separately classified as unallocated research and development expenses.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of our drug candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales of our drug candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing such drug candidates, including the uncertainty of:\n\u00b7 successful enrollment in and completion of clinical trials;\n\u00b7 establishing an appropriate safety profile;\n\u00b7 establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u00b7 receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7 commercializing the drug candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u00b7 obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our drug candidates;\n\u00b7 continued acceptable safety profiles of the products following approval; and\n\u00b7 retention of key research and development personnel.\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our drug candidates would significantly change the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of that drug candidate.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. We expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as our development programs progress, including as we continue to support the clinical trials of BGB-3111, BGB-A317, BGB-290 and BGB-283 as a treatment for various cancers and move such drug candidate into additional clinical trials. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our drug candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefit costs, including share-based compensation for general and administrative personnel. Other general and administrative expenses include professional fees for legal, consulting, auditing and tax services as well as other direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies used in general and administrative activities. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods to support increases in our research and development activities, including the continuation of the clinical trials of BGB-3111, BGB-A317, BGB-290 and BGB-283 as a treatment for various cancers and the initiation of our clinical trials for our other drug candidates. These increases will likely include increased headcount, increased share-based compensation charges,\nexpanded infrastructure and increased costs for insurance. We also anticipate increased legal, compliance, accounting and investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest on our $10 million 8% senior promissory note and $10 million 8% subordinated convertible promissory note, compounded annually, both issued to MSD in 2011. We also issued an aggregate principal amount of $3.1 million convertible promissory notes to several other investors in 2012 and 2014, all bearing interest of 8% per annum for the first three years and 15% per annum for the remaining term. In October 2014, we completed a Series A preferred share financing, as a result of which, the $10 million MSD subordinated convertible promissory note was automatically converted into 18,518,519 Series A preferred shares, and the other $3.1 million principal amount of convertible promissory notes, along with accrued interest was automatically converted into 5,470,705 Series A preferred shares. We recognized a gain on debt extinguishment of $2.9 million due to the forfeiture of interest upon the conversion, as only the principal amount of the Merck subordinated convertible promissory note was eligible for conversion. In February 2016, in connection with the closing of our initial public offering, the outstanding unpaid principal and interest of the MSD senior promissory note was automatically exchanged into 7,942,314 of our ordinary shares.\nInterest income is currently not considered significant to our financial statements but we expect interest income to increase as we invest the net proceeds from our initial public offering pending their use in operations.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively, together with the changes from year-to-year:\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 13,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 8,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ (4,219\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21,862\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (58,250\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (36,388\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,930\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (7,311\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (381\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,757\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (56,745\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (40,988\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,512\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in fair value of financial instruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,760\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (1,826\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Disposal loss on available-for-sale securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (314\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (314\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on Debt Extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,883\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ (18,546\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $ (57,102\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $ (38,556\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue from the Merck KGaA Collaboration decreased by $4.2 million to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was mainly attributable to the difference between revenues recognized in 2014 for payments received for dosing of 5th patient of BGB-283 and BGB-290 in ex-PRC trials and a payment received in 2015 for dosing of the 5th patient of BGB-283 in PRC trials.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased by $36.4 million to $58.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The following table summarizes our research and development expense by program and stage of development for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively:\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> External cost of clinical-stage programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 10,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 30,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> External cost of preclinical-stage programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Internal research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 21,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 58,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in external research and development expense was primarily attributable to the advancement of our clinical and preclinical pipeline, and included the following:\n\u00b7 Increases of approximately $7.8 million, $5.8 million, $6.4 million, and $0.7 million respectively for BGB-290, BGB-A317, BGB-3111, and BGB-283, including the recognized expenses associated with the repurchase of ex-PRC rights to BGB-290.\nThe increase in internal research and development expense was primarily attributable to the expansion of our development organization and our pipeline, and included the following:\n\u00b7 $7.7 million for increased compensation expenses, which was primarily attributable to the hiring of more development personnel during the year ended December 31, 2015 and increased share option expense ($9.6 million in 2015 increased from $4.0 million in 2014); and\n\u00b7 $4.7 million for increased facilities, reagents, consulting fee and other expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $0.4 million to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the following:\n\u00b7 $0.7 million increase of professional fees, in connection with the Series A-2 preferred share financing and initial public offering;\n\u00b7 $0.9 million increase of employee salary and benefits, which was primarily attributable to hiring of more personnel during the year ended December 31, 2015;\n\u00b7 $2.0 million decrease in stock option expense ($0.6 million in 2015 compared to $2.6 million in 2014) primarily attributable to the contractual discount in the exchange price of a loan advanced by a senior executive to the company into Series A preferred shares which was treated as a compensation expense in 2014; and\n\u00b7 $0.8 million increase of travel, office, leasing and other administrative expenses, mainly in connection with the global expansion of the company.\nInterest Income and Expense, Net\nInterest expense (net) decreased by $4.1 million from $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, resulting in net interest income of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the decrease in interest expenses following conversion of the subordinated convertible promissory note and convertible promissory notes in the Series A preferred share financing, offset by the interest income attributable to short-term investments municipal bonds and corporate fixed income bonds.\nChanges in Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nLoss from changes in fair value of financial instruments decreased by $0.9 million to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in loss from change in fair value of financial instruments was primarily attributable to changes in fair value of the redemption feature bifurcated from the MSD subordinated convertible promissory note of $2.5 million recorded in the year ended December 31, 2014 before conversion to Series A preferred shares in October 2014, offset by the fair value increase of our ordinary shares underlying the warrants and option we issued.\nDisposal Loss on Available-for-Sale Securities\nThe $314,000 disposal loss on available-for-sale securities was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 following the disposal of the available-for-sale securities.\nGain on Debt Extinguishment\nThe $2.9 million gain on debt extinguishment recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted from forfeiture of interest of the MSD subordinated convertible promissory note upon automatic conversion of the note in October 2014.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income increased by $624,000 to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $600,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Other income primarily consisted of government grants received and foreign exchange gains recognized.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2014\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, together with the changes in those items in dollars:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 11,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 13,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 1,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,463\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (21,862\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (8,399\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,143\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (6,930\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (3,787\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,458\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (15,757\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (10,299\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,153\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (3,512\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (359\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in fair value of financial instruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,760\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (2,893\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ (7,894\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $ (18,546\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $ (10,652\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nWe recognized $11.1 million and $13.0 million of collaboration revenue from the Merck KGaA Collaboration for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively. The slight increase in revenue was primarily due to the 5th patient payments received in 2014.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased by $8.4 million to $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The following table summarizes our research and development expense by program for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, respectively:\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> External cost of clinical-stage programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 5,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 10,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> External cost of preclinical-stage programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Internal research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 13,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 21,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in external research and development expense was primarily attributable to the advancement of our clinical and preclinical pipeline, and included the following:\n\u00b7 Increases of approximately $2.3 million, $1.5 million, $0.8 million and $0.1 million respectively for BGB-A317, BGB-3111, BGB-290 and BGB-283.\nThe increase in internal research and development expense was primarily attributable to the expansion of our development organization and our pipeline, and included the following:\n\u00b7 $4.6 million for increased compensation expenses, due to the hiring of more development personnel during the year ended December 31, 2014,and the grants of new share options to certain employees; and\n\u00b7 $0.2 million for increased facility, reagent, consulting and other expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $3.8 million to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to additional external legal and accounting service costs in connection with protection of our intellectual property rights and preparation for our initial public offering and increased compensation expense, and included the following:\n\u00b7 $1.2 million increase of professional fees and other expenses, mainly in connection with preparation for our initial public offering and patent applications;\n\u00b7 $2.6 million increase in compensation expenses, including: (1) increase of $2.5 million in stock option expense ($2.6 million in 2014 as compared to $0.1 million in 2013 which was mainly related to the contractual discount in the exchange price of a loan advanced by a senior executive to the company into Series A preferred shares which was treated as a compensation expense in 2014 and the grants of restricted shares to certain employees during 2014; and (2) increase of $0.1 million in employee salary and benefits, mainly due to hiring of more personnel during 2014.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense increased by $0.4 million to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to net effect of the interest expenses incurred in relation to secured guaranteed convertible promissory notes in 2014 which were later converted into Series A preferred shares and the decrease in interest expenses following conversion of the convertible promissory note to MSD.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from our operations. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from funding our research and development programs and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We incurred net losses of $7.9 million, $18.5 million and $57.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $118.2 million. Our primary use of cash is to fund research and development costs. Our operating activities provided $4.1 million, used $8.7 million, and used $39.8 million of cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Historically, we have financed our operations principally through proceeds from private placements of preferred shares, promissory notes and convertible notes of $184.4 million and proceeds from the Merck KGaA Collaboration of $37 million. At December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $100.5 million.\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015:\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided/(used in) by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 4,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ (8,694\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $ (39,843\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (250\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (33,641\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (58,906\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in)/provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (482\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 52,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 103,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net effect of foreign exchange rate changes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (41\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (485\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 3,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 9,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 3,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nThe use of cash in all periods presented resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital. The primary use of our cash in all periods presented was to fund the development of our research and development, regulatory and other clinical trial costs, and related supporting administration. Our prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expense balances in all periods presented were affected by the timing of vendor invoicing and payments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, operating activities used $39.8 million of cash, which resulted principally from our net loss of $57.1 million, adjusting for non-cash charges of $13.9 million and interest expense of $1.1 million, and by cash provided in our operating assets and liabilities of $2.3 million. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily consisted of a $1.5 million depreciation charge, $10.2 million of share-based compensation expense and a $1.8 million loss from changes in the fair value of financial instruments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, our operating activities used $8.7 million of cash, which resulted principally from our net loss of $18.5 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $11.0 million and interest expense of $3.3 million, gain on debt extinguishment of $2.9 million, and by cash used in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.6 million. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily consisted of $1.6 million of depreciation expense, $6.6 million of share-based compensation expense, a $2.8 million loss from changes in fair value of financial instruments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, our operating activities provided $4.1 million of cash, principally resulted from cash provided from changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $7.7 million, adjusted for\n$2.8 million of interest expense and non-cash charges of $1.5 million, offset by our net loss of $7.9 million. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily consisted of $1.6 million in depreciation expense.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $58.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $33.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a net purchase of $53.6 million worth of short-term investments and $5.3 million paid to purchase property and equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $33.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a net purchase of $30.5 million worth of available-for-sale investment and $2.4 million paid to repurchase non-controlling interest in BeiGene Beijing from Zhongguancun Development Group.\nNet Cash Used in/Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $103.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $52.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to the issuance of $97.4 million Series A-2 preferred shares to certain investors and loan proceeds of $6.2 million from Suzhou Industrial Park and China Construction Bank.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $52.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.5 million cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due the net proceeds of $35.5 million from the issuance of Series A preferred shares and the issuance of $17.5 million secured guaranteed convertible promissory notes, which later converted to Series A preferred shares, and partially offset by a $1.3 million repayment of promissory notes to a related party.\nOperating Capital Requirements\nWe do not expect to generate significant revenue from product sales unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize one of our current or future drug candidates. We anticipate that we will continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our drug candidates and begin to commercialize any approved products. As a newly public company, we will incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. In addition, subject to obtaining regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing and manufacturing. Accordingly, we anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations.\nBased on our current operating plan, we expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2015, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures requirements for at least the next 12 months. In that time, we expect that our expenses will increase substantially as we fund clinical development of BGB-3111, BGB-A317, BGB-290 and BGB-283, fund new and ongoing research and development activities and working capital and other general corporate purposes. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development and commercialization of our drug candidates.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews and approvals;\n\u00b7 the ability of our drug candidates to progress through clinical development successfully;\n\u00b7 the initiation, progress, timings, costs and results of non-clinical studies and clinical trials for our other programs and potential drug candidates;\n\u00b7 the number and characteristics of the drug candidate we pursue;\n\u00b7 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u00b7 the extent to which we acquire or in-license other products and technologies; and\n\u00b7 our ability to maintain and establish collaboration arrangements on favorable terms, if at all.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and government grants. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our shareholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as an ADS holder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends and may require the issuance of warrants, which could potentially dilute your ownership interest. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of payment due date by period at December 31, 2015:\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More Than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 5,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 1,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 2,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 1,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 152\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior promissory note\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 19,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 15,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 2,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 1,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 152\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Lease Commitments\nWe lease office facilities in Beijing, PRC under non-cancelable operating leases expiring on different dates. Payments under operating leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the periods of the respective leases, and the terms of the leases do not contain rent escalation, contingent rent, renewal or purchase options. The future minimum payments under these non-cancelable operating leases are summarized in the table above. In addition, we lease office facilities in the Greater Boston area and New Jersey, United States.\nSenior Promissory Note\nThe senior promissory note issued to MSD in 2011 bears an interest of 8% compounding per annum and has a term of five years. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding unpaid principal and interest of the senior promissory note was $14.6 million. In February 2016, in connection with the closing of our initial public offering, the outstanding unpaid principal and interest of the senior promissory note was automatically exchanged into 7,942,314 of our ordinary shares.\nOther Business Agreements\nWe enter into agreements in the normal course of business with CROs and institutions to license intellectual property. We have not included these future payments in the table of contractual obligations above since the contracts are cancelable at any time by us with prior written notice.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules, such as relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, which are often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating financing transactions that are not required to be reflected on our balance sheets.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis, including but not limited to, estimating the useful lives of long-lived assets, identifying separate accounting units and estimating the best estimate selling price of each deliverable in our revenue arrangements, assessing the impairment of long-lived assets, share-based compensation expenses, realizability of deferred tax assets and the fair value of warrant and option liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, contractual milestones and other various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues from research and development collaborative arrangements when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the fee is fixed or determinable, and there is reasonable assurance that the related amounts are collectible in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, or ASC 605. Our collaborative arrangements may contain multiple elements, including grants of licenses to intellectual property rights, agreement to provide research and development services and other deliverables. The deliverables under such arrangements are evaluated under ASC 605-25, Multiple-Element Arrangements. Pursuant to ASC 605-25, each required deliverable is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a separate unit of accounting based on whether the deliverable has \u201cstand-alone value\u201d to the customer. The collaborative arrangements do not include a right of return for any deliverable. The arrangement's consideration that is fixed or determinable, excluding contingent payments, is then allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. The relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price or third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE does not exist. If neither VSOE nor TPE exists, we use the best estimate of the selling price, or BESP, for the deliverable. In general, the consideration allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized as the related goods or services are delivered, limited to the consideration that is not contingent upon future deliverables. Non-refundable payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as advances from customers.\nUpfront non-refundable payments for licensing our intellectual property are evaluated to determine if the licensee can obtain stand-alone value from the license separate from the value of the research and development services and other deliverables in the arrangement to be provided by us. We act as the principal under our arrangements and licensing intellectual property is part of our ongoing major or central operations. The license right is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions. Therefore,\nwhen stand-alone value of the license is determinable, the allocated consideration is recognized as collaboration revenue upon delivery of the license rights.\nAs we act as the principal under our arrangements, and research and development services are also part of our ongoing major or central operations, we recognize the allocated consideration related to reimbursements of research and development costs as collaboration revenue when delivery or performance of such services occurs.\nProduct development, royalties and commercial event payments, collectively referred to as target payments, under collaborative arrangements are triggered either by the results of our research and development efforts, achievement of regulatory goals or by specified sales results by a third-party collaborator. Under ASC 605-28, Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition, an accounting policy election can be made to recognize a payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. We elected not to adopt the milestone method of revenue recognition under ASC 605-28.\nTargets related to our development-based activities may include initiation of various phases of clinical trials and applications and acceptance for product approvals by regulatory agencies. Due to the uncertainty involved in meeting these development-based targets, we would account for development-based targets as collaboration revenue upon achievement of the respective development target. Royalties based on reported sales of licensed products will be recognized as collaboration revenue based on contract terms when reported sales are reliably measurable and collectability is reasonably assured. Targets related to commercial activities may be triggered upon events such as first commercial sale of a product or when sales first achieve a defined level. Since these targets would be achieved after the completion of our development activities, we would account for the commercial event targets in the same manner as royalties, with collaboration revenue recognized upon achievement of the target. To date, none of the products have been approved. Hence, no revenue has been recognized related to royalties or commercial event based targets in any of the periods presented.\nAny subsequent payments to be made to the collaborator such as profit sharing payments based on net sales that are not related to research and development services would be recorded as expenses from the collaborative arrangement. To date, no payments have been made to the collaborator.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses represent costs associated with the collaborative arrangements, which primarily include (1) payroll and related costs (including share-based compensation) associated with research and development personnel; (2) costs related to clinical trials and preclinical testing of our technologies under development; (3) costs to develop the product candidates, including raw materials and supplies, product testing, depreciation, and facility related expenses; (4) expenses for research services provided by universities and contract laboratories, including sponsored research funding; and (5) other research and development expenses. Research and development expenses are charged to expense as incurred when these expenditures relate to our research and development services and have no alternative future uses.\nClinical trial costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses. We have a history of contracting with third parties that perform various clinical trial activities on behalf of us in the ongoing development of our product candidates. Expenses related to clinical trials are accrued based on our estimates of the actual services performed by the third parties for the respective period. If the contracted amounts are modified (for instance, as a result of changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed), we will modify the related accruals accordingly on a prospective basis. Revisions in the scope of a contract are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become reasonably certain.\nThe process of estimating our research and development expenses involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services\nperformed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting expenses that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our prior estimates of research and development expenses.\nShare-Based Compensation\nAwards Granted to Employees\nWe apply ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718, to account for our employee share-based payments. In accordance with ASC 718, we determine whether an award should be classified and accounted for as a liability award or equity award. All our grants of share-based awards to employees were classified as equity awards and are recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values. We have elected to recognize compensation expense using the straight-line method for all employee equity awards granted with graded vesting based on service conditions provided that the amount of compensation cost recognized at any date is at least equal to the portion of the grant-date value of the options that are vested at that date. We use the accelerated method for all awards granted with graded vesting based on performance conditions. To the extent the required vesting conditions are not met resulting in the forfeiture of the share-based awards, previously recognized compensation expense relating to those awards are reversed. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in the subsequent period if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.\nForfeiture rates are estimated based on historical and future expectations of employee turnover rates and are adjusted to reflect future changes in circumstances and facts, if any. Share-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures such that expense is recorded only for those share-based awards that are expected to vest. To the extent we revise these estimates in the future, the share-based payments could be materially impacted in the period of revision, as well as in following periods. We, with the assistance of an independent third-party valuation firm, determined the fair value of the share options granted to employees. The binomial option pricing model was applied in determining the estimated fair value of the options granted to employees.\nAwards Granted to Non-employees\nWe have accounted for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 and ASC 505, Equity. All transactions in which goods or services are received in exchange for equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date of the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the date on which the counterparty's performance is completed as there is no associated performance commitment. The expense is recognized in the same manner as if we had paid cash for the services provided by the non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50, Equity-based payments to non-employees.\nModification of Awards\nA change in any of the terms or conditions of the awards is accounted for as a modification of the award. Incremental compensation cost is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before its terms are modified, measured based on the fair value of the awards and other pertinent factors at the modification date. For vested awards, we recognize incremental compensation cost in the period the modification occurs. For unvested awards, we recognize over the remaining requisite service period, the sum of the incremental compensation cost and the remaining unrecognized compensation cost for the original award on the modification date. If the fair value of the modified award is lower than the fair value of the original award immediately before modification, the minimum compensation cost we recognize is the cost of the original award.\nSignificant Factors, Assumptions and Methodologies Used in Determining Fair Value\nThe fair value of each share option grant is estimated using the binomial option-pricing model. The model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the estimated expected share price volatility and, the share price upon which (i.e. the exercise multiple) the employees are likely to exercise share options. We historically have been a private company and lack information on our share price volatility. Therefore, we estimate our expected share price volatility based on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies, which are publicly-traded.\nWhen selecting these public companies on which we have based our expected share price volatility, we selected companies with characteristics similar to us, including the invested capital's value, business model, development stage, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the contractual life of our share-based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own share price becomes available. For the exercise multiple, as a private company, we were not able to develop an exercise pattern as reference, thus the exercise multiple is based on management's estimation, which we believe is representative of the future exercise pattern of the options. The risk-free interest rates for the periods within the contractual life of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid, and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe assumptions adopted to estimate the fair value of share options using the binomial option pricing model were as follows:\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4%-3.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9%-2.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.5%-2.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected exercise multiple\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2-2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2-2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2-2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 102%-107%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99%-104%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 94%-106%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual life\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant, and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. To the extent that actual forfeitures differ from our estimates, the difference is recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates were revised.\nThese assumptions represented our best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates when valuing our share options, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different. Total compensation cost recorded in the statements of operations, which includes share-based compensation expense, share options and restricted shares issued to our founders and employees, which were subject to vesting conditions and are fully vested, and the value of share options and restricted shares issued to non-employees for services are allocated as follows:\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ (79\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $ 4,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 9,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 6,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 10,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, there was $15.63 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation expenses, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested share-based awards which are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.32 years. As of December 31, 2014, there was $1.15 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation expenses, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested share-based awards which are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.92 years. In future periods, our share-based compensation expense is expected to increase as a result of recognizing our existing unrecognized share-based compensation for awards that will vest and as we issue additional share-based awards to attract and retain our employees.\nFair Value Estimate\nBecause a public trading market for the ADSs has been established in connection with the completion of our initial public offering, it is no longer necessary for our board of directors to estimate the fair value of our ordinary shares in connection with our accounting for granted share options and restricted shares.\nPreviously, we were required to estimate the fair value of the ordinary shares underlying our share-based awards when performing the fair value calculations with the binomial option model. Therefore, our board of directors estimated the fair value of our ordinary shares at various dates, with input from management, considering the third-party valuations of ordinary shares at each grant date. The valuations of our ordinary shares were performed using methodologies, approaches and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Audit and Accounting Practice Aid Series: Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or the AICPA Practice Guide. In addition, our board of directors considered various objective and subjective factors, along with input from management and the independent third-party valuation firm, to determine the fair value of our ordinary shares, including: external market conditions affecting the biopharmaceutical industry, trends within the biopharmaceutical industry, the prices at which we sold preferred shares, the superior rights and preference of the preferred shares or other senior securities relative to our ordinary shares at the time of each grant, the results of operations, financials position, status of our research and development efforts, our stage of development and business strategy, and the lack of an active public market for our ordinary shares, and the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event such as an initial public offering. The option-pricing method was used to allocate the invested capital's enterprise value to preferred shares or other senior securities and ordinary shares, taking into account the guidance prescribed by the AICPA Practice Guide. This method treats ordinary shares and preferred shares or other senior securities as call options on the invested capital's value, with exercise prices based on their respective payoffs upon a liquidity event.\nIn determining the invested capital's value, we applied the discounted cash flow analysis based on our projected cash flow using our best estimate as of the valuation date. The determination of our invested capital's value requires complex and subjective judgments to be made regarding our projected financial and operating results, our unique business risks, and our operating history and prospects at the time of valuation.\nOur board of directors determined the fair value of our share options and the restricted shares as of the date of grant, taking into consideration the various objective and subjective factors described above, including the conclusion of valuation of our ordinary shares as of dates close to the grant dates of our share options and the restricted shares discussed below. We computed the per share weighted-average estimated fair value for share option grants based on the binomial option pricing model and the per share weighted-average estimated fair value for restricted shares based on per share estimated fair value of ordinary shares as of the date of grant.\nDerivative Instruments\nASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, requires all contracts which meet the definition of a derivative to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements as either assets or liabilities and recorded at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized periodically in income/loss or in shareholders' deficit as a component of other comprehensive income depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. Changes in fair values of derivatives not qualified as hedges are reported in the consolidated statements of operations. The estimated fair values of derivative instruments are determined at discrete points in time based on the relevant market information. We calculated these estimates with reference to the market rates using industry standard valuation techniques with the assistance of an independent third-party valuation firm.\nAs presented in the prior subsection, \u201cFair Value Estimate,\u201d we applied the discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the invested capital's value as of various valuation dates and the option-pricing method was used to allocate the invested capital's value to preferred shares or other senior securities and ordinary shares. The derived fair value of ordinary share and preferred shares was then further used as inputs to the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the derivative instruments. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the underlying stock and the expected life of the derivative instruments. These estimates involve inherent risk and uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. To determine the expected life of the derivative instruments, we have considered factors including the timing of expected various liquidity events and their respective probabilities as well as the contractual life of the derivative instruments. The risk-free interest rates for the periods within the expected life of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve. We historically have been a private company and lack company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, we estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies, which are publicly-traded.\nWe have measured the warrant and option liabilities at fair values on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) as of December 31, 2014 and 2015. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement and the corresponding impacts to the fair values are presented below:\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Estimation\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial Instrument\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Valuation Techniques\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Unobservable Inputs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Option to purchase shares by rental deferral\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Invested capital value allocation by option-pricing model and Black-Scholes option pricing model\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Invested capital value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $145,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $665,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Volatility for invested capital value allocation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Volatility for Black-Scholes option pricing model\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72%-101%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69%-83%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Discount for lack of marketability (DLOM)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Warrants in connection with the Convertible Promissory Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Invested capital value allocation by option-pricing method and Black-Scholes option pricing model\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Invested capital value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $145,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $665,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Volatility for invested capital value allocation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Volatility for Black-Scholes option pricing model\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72%-104%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69%-83%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> DLOM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nWe evaluate our uncertain tax positions using the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires that realization of an uncertain income tax position be recognized in the financial statements. The benefit to be recorded in the financial statements is the amount most likely to be realized assuming a review by tax authorities having all relevant information and applying current conventions. It is our policy to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a component of income tax expense.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The guidance requires an entity to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest, or ASU 2015-03. To simplify presentation of debt issuance costs, ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this Update. ASU 2015-03 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In August 2015, ASU No. 2015-15-Imputation of Interest was issued to address presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers-Deferral of the effective date, or ASU 2015-14. The amendments in ASU 2015-14 defer the effective date of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers issued in May 2014. According to the amendments in ASU 2015-14, the new revenue guidance ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the method of adoption to be utilized and we cannot currently estimate the financial statement impact of adoption.\nJOBS Act\nUnder Section 107(b) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards would apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards at the same time as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. There are other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act that we are currently evaluating. For example, as an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act which would otherwise require us to (1) submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as \u201csay-on-pay,\u201d \u201csay-on-frequency\u201d and \u201cgolden parachutes;\u201d and (2) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of our chief executive officer's compensation to our median employee compensation. We also rely on an exemption from the rule requiring us to provide an auditor's attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rule requiring us to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will continue to remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of the following: (1) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenue is equal to or more than $1 billion, (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years, or (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of a biopharmaceutical company's financial condition and operations, emphasizing its focus on the development of innovative drugs for cancer treatment.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with \u201cItem 6 - Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under \u201cPart I-Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d and under \u201cForward-Looking Statements and Market Data\u201d in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a globally focused, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to becoming a leader in the discovery and development of innovative, molecularly targeted and immuno-oncology drugs for the treatment of cancer. We believe the next generation of cancer treatment will utilize therapeutics both as monotherapy and in combination to attack multiple underlying mechanisms of cancer cell growth and survival. We further believe that discovery of next generation cancer therapies requires new research tools. To that end, we have developed a proprietary cancer biology platform that addresses the importance of tumor-immune system interactions and the value of primary biopsies in developing new models to support our drug discovery effort. Our strategy is to develop a pipeline of drug candidates with the potential to be best-in-class monotherapies and also important components of multiple-agent combination regimens.\nWe have used our cancer biology platform to develop four clinical-stage drug candidates that we believe have the potential to be best-in-class or first-in-class. In addition, we believe that each has the potential to be an important component of a drug combination addressing major unmet medical needs. Our clinical-stage drug candidates include three molecularly targeted agents, BGB-3111, BGB-290 and BGB-283 and one immuno-oncology agent, BGB-A317. BGB-3111 is a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of BTK. BGB-290 is a highly selective small molecule inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2. BGB-283 is a small molecule inhibitor of both the monomer and dimer forms of RAF. For each of our molecularly targeted drug candidates, we have achieved proof-of-concept by demonstrating objective responses in the defined patient populations. Our clinical-stage immuno-oncology agent, BGB-A317, is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the immune checkpoint receptor, PD-1. In addition to our clinical-stage drug candidates, we have a robust pipeline of preclinical programs and are planning to advance one or more of these programs into the clinic in the next 18 months. We have licensed the ex-China rights of BGB-283 to Merck KGaA. We retain full global rights for all of our other clinical and preclinical drug candidates and programs.\nSince our inception on October 28, 2010, our operations have focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials. We do not have any drug candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have financed operations through a combination of debt and equity financings and private and public grants and contracts, including the net proceeds from the issuance of a senior and convertible promissory note to Merck Sharp & Dohme Research GmbH, or MSD, an affiliate of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., the private placements of our Series A preferred shares and Series A-2 preferred shares, and our collaboration with Merck KGaA, or Merck KGaA Collaboration. From January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015, we raised an aggregate of $150.3 million of gross proceeds from sales of our preferred shares, and additionally received $18.0 million from the Merck KGaA Collaboration to fund our operations. At December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $100.5 million. Although it is difficult to predict our liquidity requirements, based upon our current operating plan and the successful completion of our initial public offering, we believe we have sufficient cash to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. See \u201c-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nSince inception we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $7.9 million, $18.5 million and $57.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $118.2 million. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from funding our research and development programs and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:\n\u00b7 continue investment in our cancer biology platform;\n\u00b7 continue preclinical and clinical development of our programs;\n\u00b7 continue investment in our manufacturing facilities;\n\u00b7 hire additional research, development and business personnel;\n\u00b7 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u00b7 incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future.\nWe have licensed BGB-283 to Merck KGaA for markets outside China, but we still own the worldwide rights to our other drug candidates and retain exclusive rights to BGB-283 in China. We also have a limited collaboration with Merck KGaA on BGB-290.\nOn May 24, 2013, we entered into license agreements with Merck KGaA, which we amended and restated on December 10, 2013, and further amended on October 1, 2015 and December 3, 2015, pursuant to which (1) we granted to Merck KGaA an exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property rights to develop and manufacture, and, if Merck KGaA exercises its continuation option, to commercialize and manufacture our compound BGB-283, and any other compound covered by the same existing patent rights with primary activity to inhibit wildtype or certain mutant BRAF, in all countries of the world excluding The People's Republic of China, which we refer to as the Ex-PRC Territory, and (2) Merck KGaA granted us an exclusive license under certain of its intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize the RAF dimer inhibitor in The People's Republic of China, which we refer to as the PRC Territory, subject to certain non-compete restrictions. Under these agreements, we received $13 million in non-refundable payments in 2013 following their execution, $5 million in milestone payment in 2014 and $4 million in milestone payment in 2015. We are eligible to receive up to $32 million, $33 million and $145 million in payments upon the successful achievement of pre-specified clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones in the Ex-PRC Territory, respectively, and another $14 million in payments upon the successful achievement of pre-specified clinical milestones in the PRC Territory. Merck KGaA also is required to pay us tiered royalties ranging from the mid single-digit to the low-teens, on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, on aggregate net sales of licensed products in the Ex-PRC Territory. In consideration for the licenses Merck KGaA grants to us, we are required to pay Merck KGaA a high single-digit royalty on aggregate net sales of Licensed BRAF inhibitors in the PRC Territory.\nOn October 28, 2013, we entered into license agreements with Merck KGaA, pursuant to which (1) we granted to Merck KGaA an exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property rights to develop and manufacture, and, if Merck KGaA exercises a certain continuation option, to commercialize and manufacture our compound BGB-290 and any other compound covered by the same existing patent rights with primary activity to inhibit PARP 1, 2 or 3 enzymes in the Ex-PRC Territory, and (2) Merck KGaA granted us an exclusive license under certain of its intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize the licensed PARP inhibitors in the PRC Territory. Under these license agreements, we received $6 million in non-refundable payments in November 2013 following their execution and $9 million in milestone payments in 2014. We are eligible to receive up to $7 million and $2.5 million, in payments upon the successful achievement of pre-specified clinical and regulatory milestones in the PRC Territory respectively. On October 1, 2015, pursuant to a purchase of rights agreement, we repurchased all of Merck KGaA's worldwide rights under the ex-PRC license agreement, in consideration for, among other things, a one-time payment of $10 million and reduction of future milestone payments that we are eligible to receive under the PRC license agreement. In connection with such repurchase, the ex-PRC license agreement terminated except for certain provisions therein. The remaining $3 million of deferred revenue related to PARP as of October 1, 2015 was netted against the $10 million repurchase consideration. In addition, if Merck KGaA exercises its PRC commercialization option, as further described in the section of this Annual Report titled \u201cPart I-Item 1 - Business-Collaboration with\nMerck KGaA,\u201d Merck KGaA is required to pay us a $50 million non-refundable payment upon such exercise, and we are eligible for a $12.5 million milestone payment upon the successful achievement of a certain additional regulatory event in the PRC Territory. In consideration for the licenses granted to us, we are required to pay Merck KGaA a high single-digit royalty on aggregate net sales of licensed products in the PRC Territory.\nFor more information on our collaborations with Merck KGaA, see \u201cPart I-Item 1 - Business-Collaboration with Merck KGaA.\u201d\nWe recognized $11.1 million, $13.0 million and $8.8 million of collaboration revenue from the Merck KGaA Collaboration for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. The following table summarizes the revenue recognition schedule of an aggregate of $34.0 million in revenue from our collaboration agreements with Merck KGaA, comprised of an aggregate of $22.0 million related to BGB-283 and $12.0 million related to BGB-290. The revenue consists of an upfront non-refundable license fee, Phase 1 research and development fees, and a development based target payment related to the collaborative arrangements for BRAF, excluding the $3 million in deferred revenue that was netted against the $10 million repurchase consideration relating to the PARP inhibitors under the ex-PRC license agreement. In accordance with our revenue recognition policy, we recognize these amounts as shown in the table below:\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, substantially all of our revenue were generated solely from Merck KGaA. For the foreseeable future, we expect substantially all of our revenue will be generated from the Merck KGaA Collaboration, and any other strategic relationships we may enter into. If our development efforts are successful, we may also generate revenue from product sales.\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of the costs associated with our research and development activities, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and activities related to regulatory filings. Our research and development expenses consist of:\n\u00b7 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and share-based compensation expense for research and development personnel;\n\u00b7 expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, contract manufacturing organizations, and consultants that conduct and support clinical trials and preclinical studies;\n\u00b7 costs associated with preclinical activities and development activities;\n\u00b7 costs associated with regulatory operations; and\n\u00b7 other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies used in research and development activities.\nOur current research and development activities mainly relate to the clinical development of the following programs:\n\u00b7 BGB-3111, a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of BTK;\n\u00b7 BGB-A317, a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1;\n\u00b7 BGB-290, a highly selective small molecule inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2; and\n\u00b7 BGB-283, a small molecule inhibitor of both the monomer and dimer forms of BRAF.\nWe expense research and development costs when we incur them. We record costs for some development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information our vendors provide to us. We do not allocate employee-related costs, depreciation, rental and other indirect costs to specific research and development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product programs under research and development and, as such, are separately classified as unallocated research and development expenses.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of our drug candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales of our drug candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing such drug candidates, including the uncertainty of:\n\u00b7 successful enrollment in and completion of clinical trials;\n\u00b7 establishing an appropriate safety profile;\n\u00b7 establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u00b7 receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7 commercializing the drug candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u00b7 obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our drug candidates;\n\u00b7 continued acceptable safety profiles of the products following approval; and\n\u00b7 retention of key research and development personnel.\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our drug candidates would significantly change the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of that drug candidate.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. We expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as our development programs progress, including as we continue to support the clinical trials of BGB-3111, BGB-A317, BGB-290 and BGB-283 as a treatment for various cancers and move such drug candidate into additional clinical trials. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our drug candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefit costs, including share-based compensation for general and administrative personnel. Other general and administrative expenses include professional fees for legal, consulting, auditing and tax services as well as other direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies used in general and administrative activities. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods to support increases in our research and development activities, including the continuation of the clinical trials of BGB-3111, BGB-A317, BGB-290 and BGB-283 as a treatment for various cancers and the initiation of our clinical trials for our other drug candidates. These increases will likely include increased headcount, increased share-based compensation charges,\nexpanded infrastructure and increased costs for insurance. We also anticipate increased legal, compliance, accounting and investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest on our $10 million 8% senior promissory note and $10 million 8% subordinated convertible promissory note, compounded annually, both issued to MSD in 2011. We also issued an aggregate principal amount of $3.1 million convertible promissory notes to several other investors in 2012 and 2014, all bearing interest of 8% per annum for the first three years and 15% per annum for the remaining term. In October 2014, we completed a Series A preferred share financing, as a result of which, the $10 million MSD subordinated convertible promissory note was automatically converted into 18,518,519 Series A preferred shares, and the other $3.1 million principal amount of convertible promissory notes, along with accrued interest was automatically converted into 5,470,705 Series A preferred shares. We recognized a gain on debt extinguishment of $2.9 million due to the forfeiture of interest upon the conversion, as only the principal amount of the Merck subordinated convertible promissory note was eligible for conversion. In February 2016, in connection with the closing of our initial public offering, the outstanding unpaid principal and interest of the MSD senior promissory note was automatically exchanged into 7,942,314 of our ordinary shares.\nInterest income is currently not considered significant to our financial statements but we expect interest income to increase as we invest the net proceeds from our initial public offering pending their use in operations.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively, together with the changes from year-to-year:\n\nRevenue\nRevenue from the Merck KGaA Collaboration decreased by $4.2 million to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was mainly attributable to the difference between revenues recognized in 2014 for payments received for dosing of 5th patient of BGB-283 and BGB-290 in ex-PRC trials and a payment received in 2015 for dosing of the 5th patient of BGB-283 in PRC trials.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased by $36.4 million to $58.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The following table summarizes our research and development expense by program and stage of development for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively:\n\nThe increase in external research and development expense was primarily attributable to the advancement of our clinical and preclinical pipeline, and included the following:\n\u00b7 Increases of approximately $7.8 million, $5.8 million, $6.4 million, and $0.7 million respectively for BGB-290, BGB-A317, BGB-3111, and BGB-283, including the recognized expenses associated with the repurchase of ex-PRC rights to BGB-290.\nThe increase in internal research and development expense was primarily attributable to the expansion of our development organization and our pipeline, and included the following:\n\u00b7 $7.7 million for increased compensation expenses, which was primarily attributable to the hiring of more development personnel during the year ended December 31, 2015 and increased share option expense ($9.6 million in 2015 increased from $4.0 million in 2014); and\n\u00b7 $4.7 million for increased facilities, reagents, consulting fee and other expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $0.4 million to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the following:\n\u00b7 $0.7 million increase of professional fees, in connection with the Series A-2 preferred share financing and initial public offering;\n\u00b7 $0.9 million increase of employee salary and benefits, which was primarily attributable to hiring of more personnel during the year ended December 31, 2015;\n\u00b7 $2.0 million decrease in stock option expense ($0.6 million in 2015 compared to $2.6 million in 2014) primarily attributable to the contractual discount in the exchange price of a loan advanced by a senior executive to the company into Series A preferred shares which was treated as a compensation expense in 2014; and\n\u00b7 $0.8 million increase of travel, office, leasing and other administrative expenses, mainly in connection with the global expansion of the company.\nInterest Income and Expense, Net\nInterest expense (net) decreased by $4.1 million from $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, resulting in net interest income of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the decrease in interest expenses following conversion of the subordinated convertible promissory note and convertible promissory notes in the Series A preferred share financing, offset by the interest income attributable to short-term investments municipal bonds and corporate fixed income bonds.\nChanges in Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nLoss from changes in fair value of financial instruments decreased by $0.9 million to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in loss from change in fair value of financial instruments was primarily attributable to changes in fair value of the redemption feature bifurcated from the MSD subordinated convertible promissory note of $2.5 million recorded in the year ended December 31, 2014 before conversion to Series A preferred shares in October 2014, offset by the fair value increase of our ordinary shares underlying the warrants and option we issued.\nDisposal Loss on Available-for-Sale Securities\nThe $314,000 disposal loss on available-for-sale securities was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 following the disposal of the available-for-sale securities.\nGain on Debt Extinguishment\nThe $2.9 million gain on debt extinguishment recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted from forfeiture of interest of the MSD subordinated convertible promissory note upon automatic conversion of the note in October 2014.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income increased by $624,000 to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $600,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Other income primarily consisted of government grants received and foreign exchange gains recognized.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2014\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, together with the changes in those items in dollars:\n\nRevenue\nWe recognized $11.1 million and $13.0 million of collaboration revenue from the Merck KGaA Collaboration for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively. The slight increase in revenue was primarily due to the 5th patient payments received in 2014.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased by $8.4 million to $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The following table summarizes our research and development expense by program for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, respectively:\n\nThe increase in external research and development expense was primarily attributable to the advancement of our clinical and preclinical pipeline, and included the following:\n\u00b7 Increases of approximately $2.3 million, $1.5 million, $0.8 million and $0.1 million respectively for BGB-A317, BGB-3111, BGB-290 and BGB-283.\nThe increase in internal research and development expense was primarily attributable to the expansion of our development organization and our pipeline, and included the following:\n\u00b7 $4.6 million for increased compensation expenses, due to the hiring of more development personnel during the year ended December 31, 2014,and the grants of new share options to certain employees; and\n\u00b7 $0.2 million for increased facility, reagent, consulting and other expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $3.8 million to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to additional external legal and accounting service costs in connection with protection of our intellectual property rights and preparation for our initial public offering and increased compensation expense, and included the following:\n\u00b7 $1.2 million increase of professional fees and other expenses, mainly in connection with preparation for our initial public offering and patent applications;\n\u00b7 $2.6 million increase in compensation expenses, including: (1) increase of $2.5 million in stock option expense ($2.6 million in 2014 as compared to $0.1 million in 2013 which was mainly related to the contractual discount in the exchange price of a loan advanced by a senior executive to the company into Series A preferred shares which was treated as a compensation expense in 2014 and the grants of restricted shares to certain employees during 2014; and (2) increase of $0.1 million in employee salary and benefits, mainly due to hiring of more personnel during 2014.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense increased by $0.4 million to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to net effect of the interest expenses incurred in relation to secured guaranteed convertible promissory notes in 2014 which were later converted into Series A preferred shares and the decrease in interest expenses following conversion of the convertible promissory note to MSD.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from our operations. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from funding our research and development programs and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We incurred net losses of $7.9 million, $18.5 million and $57.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $118.2 million. Our primary use of cash is to fund research and development costs. Our operating activities provided $4.1 million, used $8.7 million, and used $39.8 million of cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Historically, we have financed our operations principally through proceeds from private placements of preferred shares, promissory notes and convertible notes of $184.4 million and proceeds from the Merck KGaA Collaboration of $37 million. At December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $100.5 million.\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015:\n\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nThe use of cash in all periods presented resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital. The primary use of our cash in all periods presented was to fund the development of our research and development, regulatory and", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with \u201cItem 6 - Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Our net losses were $7.9 million, $18.5 million and $57.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $118.2 million. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from funding our research and development programs and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:\n\u00b7 continue investment in our cancer biology platform;\n\u00b7 continue preclinical and clinical development of our programs;\n\u00b7 continue investment in our manufacturing facilities;\n\u00b7 hire additional research, development and business personnel;\n\u00b7 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u00b7 incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future.\nWe have licensed BGB-283 to Merck KGaA for markets outside China, but we still own the worldwide rights to our other drug candidates and retain exclusive rights to BGB-283 in China. We also have a limited collaboration with Merck KGaA on BGB-290.\nOn May 24, 2013, we entered into license agreements with Merck KGaA, which we amended and restated on December 10, 2013, and further amended on October 1, 2015 and December 3, 2015, pursuant to which (1) we granted to Merck KGaA an exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property rights to develop and manufacture, and, if Merck KGaA exercises its continuation option, to commercialize and manufacture our compound BGB-283, and any other compound covered by the same existing patent rights with primary activity to inhibit wildtype or certain mutant BRAF, in all countries of the world excluding The People's Republic of China, which we refer to as the Ex-PRC Territory, and (2) Merck KGaA granted us an exclusive license under certain of its intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize the RAF dimer inhibitor in The People's Republic of China, which we refer to as the PRC Territory, subject to certain non-compete restrictions. Under these agreements, we received $13 million in non-refundable payments in 2013 following their execution, $5 million in milestone payment in 2014 and $4 million in milestone payment in 2015. We are eligible to receive up to $32 million, $33 million and $145 million in payments upon the successful achievement of pre-specified clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones in the Ex-PRC Territory, respectively, and another $14 million in payments upon the successful achievement of pre-specified clinical milestones in the PRC Territory. Merck KGaA also is required to pay us tiered royalties ranging from the mid single-digit to the low-teens, on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, on aggregate net sales of licensed products in the Ex-PRC Territory. In consideration for the licenses Merck KGaA grants to us, we are required to pay Merck KGaA a high single-digit royalty on aggregate net sales of Licensed BRAF inhibitors in the PRC Territory.\nOn October 28, 2013, we entered into license agreements with Merck KGaA, pursuant to which (1) we granted to Merck KGaA an exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property rights to develop and manufacture, and, if Merck KGaA exercises a certain continuation option, to commercialize and manufacture our compound BGB-290 and any other compound covered by the same existing patent rights with primary activity to inhibit PARP 1, 2 or 3 enzymes in the Ex-PRC Territory, and (2) Merck KGaA granted us an exclusive license under certain of its intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize the licensed PARP inhibitors in the PRC Territory. Under these license agreements, we received $6 million in non-refundable payments in November 2013 following their execution and $9 million in milestone payments in 2014. We are eligible to receive up to $7 million and $2.5 million, in payments upon the successful achievement of pre-specified clinical and regulatory milestones in the PRC Territory respectively. On October 1, 2015, pursuant to a purchase of rights agreement, we repurchased all of Merck KGaA's worldwide rights under the ex-PRC license agreement, in consideration for, among other things, a one-time payment of $10 million and reduction of future milestone payments that we are eligible to receive under the PRC license agreement. In connection with such repurchase, the ex-PRC license agreement terminated except for certain provisions therein. The remaining $3 million of deferred revenue related to PARP as of October 1, 2015 was netted against the $10 million repurchase consideration. In addition, if Merck KGaA exercises its PRC commercialization option, as further described in the section of this Annual Report titled \u201cPart I-Item 1 - Business-Collaboration with\nMerck KGaA,\u201d Merck KGaA is required to pay us a $50 million non-refundable payment upon such exercise, and we are eligible for a $12.5 million milestone payment upon the successful achievement of a certain additional regulatory event in the PRC Territory. In consideration for the licenses granted to us, we are required to pay Merck KGaA a high single-digit royalty on aggregate net sales of licensed products in the PRC Territory.\nFor more information on our collaborations with Merck KGaA, see \u201cPart I-Item 1 - Business-Collaboration with Merck KGaA.\u201d\nWe recognized $11.1 million, $13.0 million and $8.8 million of collaboration revenue from the Merck KGaA Collaboration for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. The following table summarizes the revenue recognition schedule of an aggregate of $34.0 million in revenue from our collaboration agreements with Merck KGaA, comprised of an aggregate of $22.0 million related to BGB-283 and $12.0 million related to BGB-290. The revenue consists of an upfront non-refundable license fee, Phase 1 research and development fees, and a development based target payment related to the collaborative arrangements for BRAF, excluding the $3 million in deferred revenue that was netted against the $10 million repurchase consideration relating to the PARP inhibitors under the ex-PRC license agreement. In accordance with our revenue recognition policy, we recognize these amounts as shown in the table below:\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> BGB-283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> BGB-290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 8,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 2,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 11,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 22,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 11,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 33,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, substantially all of our revenue were generated solely from Merck KGaA. For the foreseeable future, we expect substantially all of our revenue will be generated from the Merck KGaA Collaboration, and any other strategic relationships we may enter into. If our development efforts are successful, we may also generate revenue from product sales.\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of the costs associated with our research and development activities, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and activities related to regulatory filings. Our research and development expenses consist of:\n\u00b7 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and share-based compensation expense for research and development personnel;\n\u00b7 expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, contract manufacturing organizations, and consultants that conduct and support clinical trials and preclinical studies;\n\u00b7 costs associated with preclinical activities and development activities;\n\u00b7 costs associated with regulatory operations; and\n\u00b7 other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies used in research and development activities.\nOur current research and development activities mainly relate to the clinical development of the following programs:\n\u00b7 BGB-3111, a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of BTK;\n\u00b7 BGB-A317, a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1;\n\u00b7 BGB-290, a highly selective small molecule inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2; and\n\u00b7 BGB-283, a small molecule inhibitor of both the monomer and dimer forms of BRAF.\nWe expense research and development costs when we incur them. We record costs for some development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information our vendors provide to us. We do not allocate employee-related costs, depreciation, rental and other indirect costs to specific research and development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product programs under research and development and, as such, are separately classified as unallocated research and development expenses.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of our drug candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales of our drug candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing such drug candidates, including the uncertainty of:\n\u00b7 successful enrollment in and completion of clinical trials;\n\u00b7 establishing an appropriate safety profile;\n\u00b7 establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u00b7 receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7 commercializing the drug candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u00b7 obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our drug candidates;\n\u00b7 continued acceptable safety profiles of the products following approval; and\n\u00b7 retention of key research and development personnel.\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our drug candidates would significantly change the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of that drug candidate.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. We expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as our development programs progress, including as we continue to support the clinical trials of BGB-3111, BGB-A317, BGB-290 and BGB-283 as a treatment for various cancers and move such drug candidate into additional clinical trials. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our drug candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefit costs, including share-based compensation for general and administrative personnel. Other general and administrative expenses include professional fees for legal, consulting, auditing and tax services as well as other direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies used in general and administrative activities. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods to support increases in our research and development activities, including the continuation of the clinical trials of BGB-3111, BGB-A317, BGB-290 and BGB-283 as a treatment for various cancers and the initiation of our clinical trials for our other drug candidates. These increases will likely include increased headcount, increased share-based compensation charges,\nexpanded infrastructure and increased costs for insurance. We also anticipate increased legal, compliance, accounting and investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest on our $10 million 8% senior promissory note and $10 million 8% subordinated convertible promissory note, compounded annually, both issued to MSD in 2011. We also issued an aggregate principal amount of $3.1 million convertible promissory notes to several other investors in 2012 and 2014, all bearing interest of 8% per annum for the first three years and 15% per annum for the remaining term. In October 2014, we completed a Series A preferred share financing, as a result of which, the $10 million MSD subordinated convertible promissory note was automatically converted into 18,518,519 Series A preferred shares, and the other $3.1 million principal amount of convertible promissory notes, along with accrued interest was automatically converted into 5,470,705 Series A preferred shares. We recognized a gain on debt extinguishment of $2.9 million due to the forfeiture of interest upon the conversion, as only the principal amount of the Merck subordinated convertible promissory note was eligible for conversion. In February 2016, in connection with the closing of our initial public offering, the outstanding unpaid principal and interest of the MSD senior promissory note was automatically exchanged into 7,942,314 of our ordinary shares.\nInterest income is currently not considered significant to our financial statements but we expect interest income to increase as we invest the net proceeds from our initial public offering pending their use in operations.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively, together with the changes from year-to-year:\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 13,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 8,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ (4,219\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21,862\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (58,250\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (36,388\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,930\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (7,311\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (381\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,757\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (56,745\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (40,988\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,512\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in fair value of financial instruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,760\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (1,826\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Disposal loss on available-for-sale securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (314\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (314\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on Debt Extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,883\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ (18,546\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $ (57,102\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $ (38,556\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue from the Merck KGaA Collaboration decreased by $4.2 million to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was mainly attributable to the difference between revenues recognized in 2014 for payments received for dosing of 5th patient of BGB-283 and BGB-290 in ex-PRC trials and a payment received in 2015 for dosing of the 5th patient of BGB-283 in PRC trials.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased by $36.4 million to $58.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The following table summarizes our research and development expense by program and stage of development for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively:\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> External cost of clinical-stage programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 10,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 30,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> External cost of preclinical-stage programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Internal research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 21,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 58,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in external research and development expense was primarily attributable to the advancement of our clinical and preclinical pipeline, and included the following:\n\u00b7 Increases of approximately $7.8 million, $5.8 million, $6.4 million, and $0.7 million respectively for BGB-290, BGB-A317, BGB-3111, and BGB-283, including the recognized expenses associated with the repurchase of ex-PRC rights to BGB-290.\nThe increase in internal research and development expense was primarily attributable to the expansion of our development organization and our pipeline, and included the following:\n\u00b7 $7.7 million for increased compensation expenses, which was primarily attributable to the hiring of more development personnel during the year ended December 31, 2015 and increased share option expense ($9.6 million in 2015 increased from $4.0 million in 2014); and\n\u00b7 $4.7 million for increased facilities, reagents, consulting fee and other expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $0.4 million to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the following:\n\u00b7 $0.7 million increase of professional fees, in connection with the Series A-2 preferred share financing and initial public offering;\n\u00b7 $0.9 million increase of employee salary and benefits, which was primarily attributable to hiring of more personnel during the year ended December 31, 2015;\n\u00b7 $2.0 million decrease in stock option expense ($0.6 million in 2015 compared to $2.6 million in 2014) primarily attributable to the contractual discount in the exchange price of a loan advanced by a senior executive to the company into Series A preferred shares which was treated as a compensation expense in 2014; and\n\u00b7 $0.8 million increase of travel, office, leasing and other administrative expenses, mainly in connection with the global expansion of the company.\nInterest Income and Expense, Net\nInterest expense (net) decreased by $4.1 million from $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, resulting in net interest income of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the decrease in interest expenses following conversion of the subordinated convertible promissory note and convertible promissory notes in the Series A preferred share financing, offset by the interest income attributable to short-term investments municipal bonds and corporate fixed income bonds.\nChanges in Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nLoss from changes in fair value of financial instruments decreased by $0.9 million to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in loss from change in fair value of financial instruments was primarily attributable to changes in fair value of the redemption feature bifurcated from the MSD subordinated convertible promissory note of $2.5 million recorded in the year ended December 31, 2014 before conversion to Series A preferred shares in October 2014, offset by the fair value increase of our ordinary shares underlying the warrants and option we issued.\nDisposal Loss on Available-for-Sale Securities\nThe $314,000 disposal loss on available-for-sale securities was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 following the disposal of the available-for-sale securities.\nGain on Debt Extinguishment\nThe $2.9 million gain on debt extinguishment recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted from forfeiture of interest of the MSD subordinated convertible promissory note upon automatic conversion of the note in October 2014.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income increased by $624,000 to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $600,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Other income primarily consisted of government grants received and foreign exchange gains recognized.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2014\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, together with the changes in those items in dollars:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 11,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 13,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 1,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,463\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (21,862\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (8,399\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,143\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (6,930\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (3,787\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,458\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (15,757\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (10,299\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,153\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (3,512\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (359\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in fair value of financial instruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,760\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (2,893\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ (7,894\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $ (18,546\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $ (10,652\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nWe recognized $11.1 million and $13.0 million of collaboration revenue from the Merck KGaA Collaboration for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively. The slight increase in revenue was primarily due to the 5th patient payments received in 2014.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased by $8.4 million to $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.

The increase was primarily attributable to additional external legal and accounting service costs in connection with protection of our intellectual property rights and preparation for our initial public offering and increased compensation expense, and included the following:\n\u00b7 $1.2 million increase of professional fees and other expenses, mainly in connection with preparation for our initial public offering and patent applications;\n\u00b7 $2.6 million increase in compensation expenses, including: (1) increase of $2.5 million in stock option expense ($2.6 million in 2014 as compared to $0.1 million in 2013 which was mainly related to the contractual discount in the exchange price of a loan advanced by a senior executive to the company into Series A preferred shares which was treated as a compensation expense in 2014 and the grants of restricted shares to certain employees during 2014; and (2) increase of $0.1 million in employee salary and benefits, mainly due to hiring of more personnel during 2014.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense increased by $0.4 million to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to net effect of the interest expenses incurred in relation to secured guaranteed convertible promissory notes in 2014 which were later converted into Series A preferred shares and the decrease in interest expenses following conversion of the convertible promissory note to MSD.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from our operations. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from funding our research and development programs and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We incurred net losses of $7.9 million, $18.5 million and $57.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.
