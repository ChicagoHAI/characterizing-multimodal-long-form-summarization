Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of immunotherapeutics based on our proprietary arenavirus platform that is designed to target and amplify a T cell and immune response to disease. Our replicating and non-replicating technologies are engineered to induce robust and durable antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses and pathogen-neutralizing antibodies. We believe that our technologies can meaningfully leverage the human\nimmune system for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes by inducing CD8+ T cell response levels previously not achieved by other immunotherapy approaches.\nWe are building a proprietary immuno-oncology pipeline by targeting oncoviral cancer antigens, self-antigens and next-generation antigens. Our oncology portfolio includes three disclosed programs, HB-200, HB-300 and HB-700, which all use our replicating technology. HB-200 is in clinical development for the treatment of Human Papillomavirus 16-positive (HPV16+) cancers in an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial. HB-300 is in development for the treatment of prostate cancer and expected to move into the clinic after the third quarter 2022 investigational new drug application filing. HB-700 is our newest asset in preclinical development for treatment of KRAS mutated cancers, including, lung, colorectal and pancreatic cancers.\nOur HB-200 program is comprised of HB-201 single vector therapy and HB-201/HB-202 two vector therapy. Both therapies are being evaluated in an ongoing HB-200 Phase 1/2 study. In November 2021, we announced interim data on our ongoing Phase 1 portion of the study, showing promising anti-tumor activity against advanced/metastatic HPV16+ cancers and favorable tolerability. Data demonstrated responses and stable disease in head and neck cancer patients who failed prior standard of care therapy. We believe that these early-stage data establish proof of concept for our replicating single-vector immunotherapy in oncology.\nIn January 2022, we dosed the first patient with a combination of HB-201 and pembrolizumab for the treatment of first line advanced/metastatic HPV16+ HNSCC in the Phase 2 expansion portion of the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial. In September 2021, we entered into a clinical collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc. to evaluate the combination of HB-200 and Merck & Co., Inc's anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA\u00ae (pembrolizumab) in a separate randomized Phase 2 study.\nOur non-replicating prophylactic Cytomegalovirus, or CMV, vaccine candidate, HB-101, is a potential first in-class compound in a Phase 2 clinical trial for patients awaiting kidney transplantation. In November 2021, we reported safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data, whereby the three-dose schedule of HB-101 pre-transplantation showed a trend of reducing incidence of CMV viremia and antiviral use. The trial will continue to follow patients currently on-study with final top-line data readout in the first half of 2023. We have decided to pursue HB-101 further only if we are able to partner the program with a collaborator, thereby enabling greater strategic focus on the immuno-oncology programs.\nWe have funded our operations to date primarily from private placements of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, with aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $142.5 million, grant funding and loans from an Austrian government agency, and $26.2 million in upfront and milestone payments from Gilead in connection with a research collaboration and license agreement. On April 23, 2019, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock (IPO) in which we issued 6.0 million shares of our common stock, at $14.00 per share, for gross proceeds of $84.0 million, or net proceeds of $74.6 million. On December 11, 2020, we completed a follow-on public offering in which we issued 3.9 million shares of our common stock, at $11.75 per share, and 2,978 shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock, at $11,750.00 per share, for net proceeds of $75.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. As of December 31, 2021, the principal amount outstanding under loans from government agencies was $6.1 million and we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $66.9 million. In February 2022 we received a $15.0 million initiation fee in connection with Restated Collaboration Agreement with Gilead. In addition, Gilead purchased unregistered shares of our common stock for $5.0 million. In March 2022, we issued and sold 21,700,000 shares of our common stock at $2.00 per share, and 15,800 shares of our Series A-1 convertible preferred stock at $2,000.00 per share in a follow-on public offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately $70.0 million.\nWe do not expect to generate revenue from any product candidates that we develop until we obtain regulatory approval for one or more of such product candidates, if at all, and commercialize our products or enter into additional collaboration agreements with third parties. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.\nAll of our product candidates, including our most advanced oncology product candidate, HB-200, will require substantial additional development time and resources before we would be able to apply for and receive regulatory approvals and begin generating revenue from product sales. Before launching our first products, if approved, we plan to establish our own manufacturing facility to reduce or eliminate our reliance on contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) which will require substantial capital expenditures and cause additional operating expenses. We currently have no marketing and sales organization and have no experience in marketing products; accordingly, we will incur significant expenses to develop a marketing organization and sales force in advance of generating any commercial product sales. As a result, we will need substantial additional capital to support our operating activities. In addition, we expect to continue to incur legal, accounting and other expenses in operating our business, including the costs associated with operating as a public company.\nWe currently anticipate that we will seek to fund our operations through equity or debt financings or other sources, such as government grants and additional collaboration agreements with third parties. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If sufficient funds on acceptable terms are not available when needed, we will be required to significantly reduce our operating expenses and delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs.\nWe have incurred net losses each year since our inception in 2011, including net losses of $75.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $44.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $222.8 million and we do not expect positive cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future, if ever. We expect to continue to incur net operating losses for at least the next several years as we advance our product candidates through clinical development, seek regulatory approval, prepare for and, if approved, proceed to commercialization, continue our research and development efforts and invest to establish a commercial manufacturing facility.\nWe believe that the net proceeds from our offering in March 2022, the funds received under Restated Collaboration Agreement with Gilead, both described below, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at least through the next 12 months from the issuance date of the consolidated financial statement. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nSpecial Note About Coronavirus (COVID-19)\nIn March 2020, we announced initial potential business impacts related to the outbreak of a novel strain of virus named SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome 2), or coronavirus, which causes coronavirus disease, or COVID-19. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced, and may further experience, disruptions that have and could further adversely impact our business operations as well as our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Specifically, nearly all of the Phase 2 trial sites we utilize for our HB-101 Phase 2 trial had temporarily suspended enrollment of patients, resumed patient enrollment, but suspended enrollment again during periods of increased confirmed infections in the United States and Europe. As a result, the total number of patients in the trial at the conclusion of enrollment in June 2021 was below the originally planned number of patients.\nIn addition, certain aspects of our supply chain were temporarily impacted as certain of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers had paused their operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or had otherwise encountered delays in providing their services. The uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have led us to temporarily focus on our core program, HB-200, as well as research and development activities under our collaboration with Gilead. Certain earlier stage programs, including HB-300 were temporarily de-prioritized only allocated the resources that could be made available without impacting our core programs. While we have resumed activities for these earlier stage programs in 2021, we continue to evaluate the extent to which potential constraints of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers will impact our ability to manufacture our product candidates for our clinical trials and conduct other research and development operations and maintain applicable timelines. The ultimate impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our business operations as well as our preclinical studies and clinical trials remains uncertain and subject to change and will depend on future developments, which cannot be accurately predicted. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.\nFurthermore, in order to preserve resources and liquidity, all of our officers had waived at least 25% of their cash salaries for the three months ended June 30, 2020, and the vast majority of our employees agreed to a temporary salary reduction of 20% for the three months ended June 30, 2020. We compensated our officers and employees for the forgone cash salaries by issuing restricted stock units in July 2020. Our directors have also accepted to receive equity instead of cash for their accrued board fees. We encourage our staff to work from home where possible, and encourage our Vienna employees to make use of the readily-available PCR testing in order to enhance health and safety, in particular for laboratory work that has to be performed on site. Since October 2021 we have required our employees to be either fully vaccinated, cured from a COVID-19 infection or to have obtained a negative PCR-test to enter our offices.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue from collaboration and licensing\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to do so in the near future, if at all. All of our revenue to date has been derived from a research collaboration and license agreement with Gilead.\nOn June 4, 2018, we entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement, with Gilead to evaluate potential vaccine products using or incorporating our replicating technology and non-replicating technology for the treatment, cure, diagnosis or prevention of HBV and HIV.\nUnder the Collaboration Agreement, we granted Gilead an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to our technology platform for researching, developing, manufacturing and commercializing products for HIV or HBV. We received a non-refundable $10.0 million upfront payment upon entering the Collaboration Agreement. In February 2022, we signed an amended and restated collaboration agreement, the Restated Collaboration Agreement, which revised the terms only for the HIV program, whereby we will take on development responsibilities for the HIV program candidate through a Phase 1b clinical trial. Pursuant to the Restated Collaboration Agreement, Gilead will retain an exclusive right, the Option, to take back the rights for the HIV program, including further development and commercialization in return for an option exercise payment of $10.0 million. Pursuant to the Restated Collaboration Agreement, we are eligible for up to $140.0 million in developmental milestone payments for the HBV program and $50.0 million in commercialization milestone payments. If Gilead exercises the Option, we are eligible for up to $167.5 million in developmental milestone payments for the HIV program, inclusive of the $10.0 million Option exercise payment, and $65.0 million in commercialization milestone payments for the HIV program. Upon the commercialization of a product, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties of a high single-digit to mid-teens percentage on the worldwide net sales of each HBV product, and royalties of a mid-single-digit to 10% of worldwide net sales of each HIV product. Gilead is obligated to reimburse us for our costs, including all benefits, travel, overhead, and any other expenses, relating to performing research and development activities under the Restated Collaboration Agreement with respect to the HBV program, and if the Option is exercised, the HIV program. Through to December 31, 2021, we have received from Gilead the non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million and $12.2 million in milestone payments for the achievement of pre-clinical research milestones. In addition, we have recognized $35.6 million of cost reimbursements for research and development services performed under the Collaboration Agreement. In the first quarter of 2022, we received an additional milestone payment of $4.0 million and the initiation payment of $15.0 million due upon execution of the Restated Collaboration Agreement to fund our future performance of development activities under the Restated Collaboration Agreement.\nWe determined that our performance obligations under the terms of the Restated Collaboration Agreement included one combined performance obligation for each of the HBV and HIV research programs, comprised of the transfer of intellectual property rights and providing research and development services. Accordingly, we recognize these amounts as revenue over the performance period of the respective services on a percent of completion basis using total estimated research and development labor hours for each of the performance obligations.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses since inception have only consisted of research and development costs and general administrative costs.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nSince our inception, we have focused significant resources on our research and development activities, including establishing our arenavirus platform, conducting preclinical studies, developing a manufacturing process, conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial and the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial for HB-101 as well as initiating a Phase 1/2 trial for HB-201 and preparing an investigational new drug, or IND, application for HB-202. Research and development activities account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These costs include:\nTable 327: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel engaged in research and development functions; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 328: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical development of our programs and clinical trials of our product candidates, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors, academic institutions and contract research organizations (CROs); </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 329: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the cost of manufacturing drug products for use in clinical trials, including under agreements with third parties, such as CMOs, consultants and contractors; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 330: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>laboratory costs; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 331: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>leased facility costs, equipment depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 332: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>intellectual property costs incurred in connection with filing and prosecuting patent applications as well as third-party license fees. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe majority of our research and development costs are external costs, which we track on a program-by-program basis. We do not track our internal research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis as they primarily relate to shared costs deployed across multiple projects under development.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in the future as we advance our existing and future product candidates into and through clinical trials and pursue regulatory approval. The process of conducting the necessary clinical studies to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. Clinical trials generally become larger and more costly to conduct as they advance into later stages and, in the future, we will be required to make estimates for expense accruals related to clinical trial expenses.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any product candidates that we develop from our programs. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales of product candidates we develop, if at all. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates, including the uncertainty of:\nTable 333: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 334: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>sufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 335: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>acceptance of INDs for our planned clinical trials or future clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 336: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>successful enrollment and completion of clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 337: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>successful data from our clinical program that support an acceptable risk-benefit profile of our product candidates in the intended populations; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 338: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>receipt and maintenance of regulatory and marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 339: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>scale-up of our manufacturing processes and formulation of our product candidates for later stages of development and commercialization; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 340: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>establishing our own manufacturing capabilities or agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if our product candidate is approved; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 341: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>entry into collaborations to further the development of our product candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 342: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 343: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>successfully launching commercial sales of our product candidates, if and when approved; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 344: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>acceptance of the product candidates benefits and uses, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 345: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the prevalence and severity of adverse events experienced with our product candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 346: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 347: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>effectively competing with other therapies; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 348: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>obtaining and maintaining healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 349: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>qualifying for, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs in our executive, finance and investor relations, business development and administrative functions. Other general and administrative expenses include consulting fees and professional service fees for auditing, tax and legal services, lease expenses related to our offices, premiums for directors and officers liability insurance, depreciation and other costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in the future as we expand our operating activities and prepare for potential commercialization of our current and future product candidates, increase our headcount and investor relations activities and maintain compliance with requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nGrant Income\nSince inception, we have received grants from the Austrian Research Promotions Agency, either under funding agreements or under research incentive programs. In addition, we have received loans under funding agreements that\nbear interest at below market interest rate. We account for the grants received as other income and for the imputed benefits arising from the difference between a market rate of interest and the rate of interest as additional grant income, and record interest expense for the loans at a market rate of interest.\nWe participate in a research incentive program provided by the Austrian government under which we are entitled to reimbursement of a percentage of qualifying research and development expenses and capital expenditures incurred in Austria. Submissions for reimbursement under the program are submitted annually. Incentive amounts are generally paid out during the calendar year that follows the year of the expenses but remain subject to subsequent examinations by the responsible authority.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense results primarily from loans under funding agreements with the Austrian Research Promotion Agency, recorded at a market rate of interest. The difference between interest payments payable pursuant to the loans, which rates are at below market interest rates, and the market interest rate, is accounted for as grant income.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense results from foreign minimum income tax and profit on a legal entity basis. The losses that we have incurred since inception result primary from the losses of our Austrian subsidiary. As of December 31, 2021, we had a deferred tax asset of $58.8 million primarily resulting from foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $219.7 million with no expiry date. We have considered that, at this point in time, it is uncertain whether we will ever be able to realize the benefits of the deferred tax asset, and accordingly, have established a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2021.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 350: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue from collaboration and licensing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 18,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 19,584\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (82,853)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (54,787)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17,269)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,082)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100,122)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (72,869)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (81,674)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (53,285)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grant income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,517\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 400\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (898)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (786)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and expenses, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,843)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,072\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,203\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss before tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (75,664)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (44,082)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (75,665)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (44,082)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue from Collaboration and Licensing\nRevenue was $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe decrease of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to lower revenue from research milestones, and lower recognition of deferred revenue related to upfront and milestone payments, partially offset by higher cost reimbursements received under the Restated Collaboration Agreement with Gilead.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue included $16.3 million from reimbursement of research and development expenses, $0.6 million from partial recognition of deferred revenue related to the upfront payment of $10.0 million that we received in June 2018 and $1.5 million from partial recognition of the $4.0 million milestone payment that we received in 2020. In the year ended December 31, 2021 we completed the recognition of the deferred revenue related to the upfront payment of $10.0 million that we received in June 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue included $13.0 million from reimbursement of research and development expenses, $2.0 million from partial recognition of deferred revenue related to the upfront payment of $10.0 million that we received in June 2018 and $2.4 million from partial recognition of the $4.0 million milestone payment that we received in February 2020, as well as $2.2 million of revenue that was recognized upon the achievement of research milestones in June and December 2020.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our research and development expenses were $82.9 million, compared to $54.8 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe increase of $28.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to an increase in direct research and development expenses of $21.2 million, and an increase in internal research and development expenses of $6.9 million.\nThe primary drivers of the increase in direct research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 were an increase in manufacturing and quality control expenses of $9.9 million, an increase in clinical study expenses of $3.2 million, along with an increase in other direct expenses and laboratory expenses of $8.1 million. The increase was mainly due to the progress in the clinical trial of our HB-200 program, particularly, the increased patient recruitment and related clinical trial monitoring and testing activities, as well as manufacturing and quality control work in preparation of a further extension of the trial. Manufacturing and quality control expenses were also driven by the progress towards clinical development in our Gilead partnered programs and other preclinical programs.\nThe increase in internal research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses by $4.4 million, and an increase in facility related and other internal research and development expenses by $2.5 million. The increase in personnel-related research and development expenses resulted primarily from our increased research and development\nheadcount and an increase in stock compensation expenses. Other internal research and development costs and facility related costs also increased as a result of our expansion of research and development activities and headcount.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by product candidate or program (in thousands):\nTable 351: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct research and development expenses by program:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HB-101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HB-201/202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,162\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gilead partnered programs(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,129\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other and earlier-stage programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,298\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sub-total direct expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,609\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal research and development expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel related (including stock-based compensation)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,833\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility related\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,224\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other internal costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,121\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sub-total internal expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,178\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 82,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 54,787\n</td> </tr>\n</table> (1) Expenses incurred by us in connection with Gilead partnered programs are reimbursed to us by Gilead and accounted for as revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $17.3 million, compared to $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe decrease of $0.8 million was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related expenses of $0.4 million, and a decrease in other general and administrative expenses of $0.6 million, partially offset by an increase in professional and consulting fees of $0.2 million. The decrease in personnel-related expenses resulted from decreased stock compensation expenses, partially offset by a growth in headcount along with increased salaries in our general and administrative functions.\nGrant Income\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021 we recorded grant income of $9.7 million, compared to $6.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from grants, research incentives and imputed benefits from below market interest rates on loans from governmental agencies. The increase of $3.2 million was primarily due to higher income from Austrian research and development incentives.\nInterest Income and Expense\nInterest income was less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease of $0.3 million, despite higher cash balances over almost the entire year, was due to the drop in interest rates in the United States and Europe. Interest income represents interest from cash and cash equivalents held in US dollars resulting from the proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock as well as payments received under our Collaboration Agreement with Gilead. During the year ended December 31, 2021 our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were mainly held in dollars at U.S. investment grade financial institutions or in money market funds. In addition, smaller amounts were held in euros at our Austrian subsidiary that produced no material interest income due to the low or zero interest rate policy in the European Monetary Union.\nInterest expenses for loans from government agencies were $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest expense was recorded at the market rate of interest, which exceeded the contractual interest.\nOther Income and Expenses\nOther expenses were $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to other income of $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease of $5.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted primarily from exchange rate differences and foreign currency remeasurements. In addition the prior year effect from the recognition of $0.2 million in support under the Corona Short Term Work Program in Austria contributed to the decrease in other income and expenses in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nDiscussion of the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019 is included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the SEC on March 18, 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception in 2011, we have funded our operations primarily through private placements of our convertible preferred stock and proceeds from our IPO and follow-on public offering, from grants, research incentives and borrowings under various agreements with public funding agencies, and from an upfront payment, milestone payments and reimbursement of research and development expenses pursuant to the Restated Collaboration Agreement with Gilead.\nWe have raised gross proceeds of approximately $142.5 million from the issuance of our convertible preferred stock and $26.2 million from non-refundable upfront and milestone payments pursuant to the Restated Collaboration Agreement with Gilead of which we received $4.0 million in January 2022. In April 2019, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 6,000,000 shares of our common stock, at $14.00 per share, for gross proceeds of $84.0 million, or net proceeds of $74.6 million. On December 11, 2020, we completed a follow-on public offering in which we issued 3,910,000 shares of our common stock, at $11.75 per share, and 2,978 shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock, at $11,750.00 per share, for net proceeds of $75.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. As of December 31, 2021, the principal amount outstanding under loans from government agencies was $6.1 million and we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $66.9 million. In February 2022 we received a $15.0 million initiation fee in connection with the amended and restated collaboration agreement with Gilead. In addition, Gilead purchased unregistered shares of our common stock for $5.0 million. In March 2022, we issued and sold 21,700,000 shares of our common stock at $2.00 per share, and 15,800 shares of our Series A-1 convertible preferred stock at $2,000.00 per share in a follow-on public offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately $70.0 million.\nWe entered into various funding agreements with the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (\u00d6sterreichische Forschungsf\u00f6rderungsgesellschaft, or FFG). The loans by FFG, or the FFG Loans, were made on a project-by-project basis and bear interest at a rate of 0.75% per annum. In the event that the underlying program research results in a scientific or technical failure, the principal then outstanding under any loan may be forgiven by FFG and converted to non-repayable grant funding on a project-by-project basis. The FFG Loans contain no financial covenants and are not secured by any of our assets. The debt obligation is $6.1 million, principal repayments are due as follows: $3.1 million are due in 2022, $1.8 million are due in 2023, and the remaining $1.2 million are due upon final maturity in 2024.\nBecause the FFG Loans bear interest at below market rates we account for the imputed benefit arising from the difference between an estimated market rate of interest and the contractual interest rate as grant funding from FFG, which is included in grant income. On the date that FFG Loan proceeds are received, we recognize the portion of the loan proceeds allocated to grant funding as a discount to the carrying value of the loan and as unearned income. As of December 31, 2021, the unamortized debt discount related to FFG Loans was $1.1 million.\nWe entered into arrangements with contract manufacturing organizations. As of December 31, 2021, we had total non-cancellable obligations under such contracts of $10.5 million.\nWe do not expect positive cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future, if at all. Historically, we have incurred operating losses as a result of ongoing efforts to develop our arenavirus technology platform and our product candidates, including conducting ongoing research and development, preclinical studies, clinical trials, providing general and administrative support for these operations and developing our intellectual property portfolio. We expect to continue to incur net operating losses for at least the next several years as we progress clinical development, seek regulatory approval, prepare for and, if approved, proceed to commercialization of our most advanced oncology product candidate HB-200, continue our research and development efforts relating to our other and future product candidates, and invest in our manufacturing capabilities and our own manufacturing facility.\nFuture Funding Requirements\nWe have no products approved for commercial sale. To date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in each period since our inception in 2011. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $222.8 million. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:\nTable 352: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>pursue the clinical and preclinical development of our current and future product candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 353: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>leverage our technologies to advance product candidates into preclinical and clinical development; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 354: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>seek regulatory approvals for product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 355: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>attract, hire and retain additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 356: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>establish our manufacturing capabilities through third parties or by ourselves and scale-up manufacturing to provide adequate supply for clinical trials and commercialization; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 357: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>expand our operational, financial and management systems and increase personnel, including personnel to support our clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 358: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 359: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>establish a sales, marketing, medical affairs and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval and intend to commercialize on our own or jointly; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 360: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 361: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating our business, including ongoing costs associated with operating as a public company. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEven if we succeed in commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we will continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenditures to develop and market additional product candidates. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders' equity and working capital.\nWe will require substantial additional financing and a failure to obtain this necessary capital could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts or other operations.\nSince our inception, we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in research and development activities for our non-replicating and replicating technologies and our product candidates derived from these technologies. Preclinical studies and clinical trials and additional research and development activities will require substantial funds to complete. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with the development of our current product candidates and programs as well as any future product candidates we may choose to pursue, as well as the gradual gaining of control over our required manufacturing capabilities and other corporate uses. These expenditures will include costs associated with conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and manufacturing and supply, as well as marketing and selling any products approved for sale. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. Because the outcome of any preclinical study or clinical trial is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our current or future product candidates.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:\nTable 362: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our current and future product candidates and programs, and of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 363: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we may pursue, and other indications for our current product candidates that we may pursue; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 364: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the stability, scale and yields of our future manufacturing process as we scale-up production and formulation of our product candidates for later stages of development and commercialization; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 365: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory and marketing approvals and developing our ability to establish sales and marketing capabilities, if any, for our current and future product candidates we develop if clinical trials are successful; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 366: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the success of our collaboration with Gilead; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 367: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our ability to establish and maintain collaborations, strategic licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 368: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the cost of commercialization activities for our current and future product candidates that we may develop, whether alone or with a collaborator; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 369: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, expanding, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 370: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, our future products, if any; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 371: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the emergence of competing oncology and infectious disease therapies and other adverse market developments. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA change in the outcome of any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any of our current and future product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future, and we will need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans.\nWe do not have any committed external source of funds or other support for our development efforts. Until we can generate sufficient product and royalty revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect\nto finance our future cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing or distribution arrangements as well as grant funding. Based on our research and development plans, we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents, including the funds we received from our offering in March 2022 and the funds received under the amended and restated research collaboration and license Agreement with Gilead, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. These estimates are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect.\nIf we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders' rights. Further, to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, the ownership interest of our shareholders will be diluted. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we would be subject to fixed payment obligations and may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on favorable terms when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or terminate one or more of our research and development programs or clinical trials.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the primary sources and uses of cash (in thousands):\nTable 372: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (66,016)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (39,339)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,581)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,371)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (235)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,420\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (78,832)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,710\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Used in Operating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in operating activities was $66.0 million, which consisted of a net loss of $75.7 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $13.6 million and cash used due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $3.9 million. The non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $7.6 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $4.7 million, and other non-cash items of $1.3 million. The change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $7.1 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $1.9 million, a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $1.6 million, a decrease in other non-current liabilities of $0.4 million, and an increase in receivable research incentives of $0.3 million, partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $4.8 million, an increase of deferred revenues of $1.4 million, an increase in accounts payable of $0.9 million, and a decrease in other non-current assets of $0.4 million. Changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other non-current assets in the year ended December 31, 2021 were generally due to growth in our business, the advancement of our research programs and the timing of invoicing and payments. Changes in operating lease liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2021 were mainly due to regular lease payments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in operating activities was $39.3 million, which consisted of a net loss of $44.1 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $12.9 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $8.1 million. The non-cash charges consisted of stock-based compensation of $8.7 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $4.1 million, and other non-cash items of $0.1 million. The change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in receivable research incentives of $5.8 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $3.6 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $2.3 million, a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $1.8 million, an increase in other non-current assets of $1.1 million, a decrease of accrued\nexpenses and other current liabilities of $0.2 million and a decrease in other non-current liabilities of $0.1 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $6.3 million and an increase of deferred revenues of $0.5 million. Changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accounts receivables and other non-current assets in the year ended December 31, 2020 were generally due to growth in our business, the advancement of our research programs and the timing of invoicing and payments. Changes in operating lease liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2020 were mainly due to regular lease payments.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, cash used in investing activities was $12.6 million and $2.4 million, respectively. The increase of $10.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted from the acquisition of land and capital expenditures in connection with our own GMP manufacturing facility project and was partially offset by lower expenditures for laboratory and office space extension and purchase of equipment. Cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted from capital expenditures in connection with leasehold improvements to expand our laboratory space and for purchase of property and equipment.\nCash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in financing activities was $0.2 million and consisted primarily of payments related to finance leases, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $73.4 million, which consisted mainly of net proceeds of $75.0 million from our follow-on public offering in December 2020, partially offset by a repayment of a loan of $1.3 million.\nIntellectual Property Licenses\nIn October 2011, we entered into a license agreement with University of Zurich for an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license for a propagation-deficient arenavirus vector. Pursuant to the license agreement, we are obligated to pay the University of Zurich low single-digit royalties on aggregate net sales of products licensed under the agreement, and to pay percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to 20% of the sublicense fees that we may receive from sublicensing, depending on the amount of fees received from sublicensees.\nIn January 2017, we entered into a license agreement with University of Basel for an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license for a tri-segmented Pichinde virus vector. We are required to use reasonable efforts to make commercially available licensed products. Pursuant to the license agreement, we are obligated to pay nominal milestone payments for each licensed product upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and to pay royalties of low single digits of net sales of licensed products. We are also obligated to pay a low- to high-single digit percentage of the sublicense fees that we may receive from sublicensing.\nIn February 2017, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Geneva for an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license for a tri-segmented arenavirus vector. Pursuant to the license agreement, we are obligated to pay the University of Geneva an annual fee which is fully deductible from any milestone, royalty or sublicense payments. We are also obligated to pay milestone nominal payments for each licensed product upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and to pay low single-digit royalties on aggregate net sales of products licensed under the agreement, and to pay percentages ranging from the low-single digits to 10% of the sublicense fees that we may receive from sublicensing.\nIn September 2013, we entered into a Biological Materials License Agreement with NIH for a worldwide, nonexclusive license to make, have made, import and use certain cells and cell clones developed at the Vaccine Research Center of the NIH, i.e., the NIH Licensed Products, to manufacture viral vectors based on our proprietary arenavirus-based vectors. Pursuant to the terms of the NIH Agreement, we are obligated to pay the NIH low to mid six figure annual royalty payments, increasing as our most developed product candidate manufactured from NIH Licensed\nProducts proceeds through development stages. We must also pay the NIH 10% of any consideration we receive from sublicensees.\nIn October 2020, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Basel for an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license for a tri-segmented arenavirus Split vector technology. We are required to use reasonable efforts to make commercially available licensed products. Pursuant to the license agreement, we are obligated to pay the University of Basel an annual fee which is fully deductible from any milestone, royalty or sublicense payments. We are also obligated to pay nominal milestone payments for each licensed product upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and to pay royalties of low single digits of net sales of licensed products. We are also obligated to pay a low double digit to low single digit percentage of the sublicense fees that we may receive from sublicensing.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $1.3 million in licensing fees from intellectual property licenses as research and development expenses. At December 31, 2021, $0.3 million payable from sublicensing fees were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $1.2 million in licensing fees from intellectual property licenses as research and development expenses. At December 31, 2020, $0.1 million payable from sublicensing fees were included in accounts payable.\nFor additional information on these license agreements, please see Business-Intellectual Property-License Agreements.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, and generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur critical accounting policies and the methodologies and assumptions we apply under them have not materially changed as compared to those disclosed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the SEC on March 18, 2021.\nRecognition of revenue from contracts with customers\nWe have entered into the Restated Collaboration Agreement with Gilead for the development and commercialization of certain of its product candidates. Our performance obligations under the terms of this agreement include one combined performance obligation for each research program comprised of the transfer of intellectual property rights (licenses) and providing research and development services. Payments by Gilead to us under this agreement included a non-refundable up-front payment, payments for research and development activities, and may include payments based upon the achievement of defined pre-clinical development and commercial milestones and royalties on product sales if certain future conditions are met.\nWe evaluate our collaboration and licensing arrangements pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 606, or ASC 606. To determine the recognition of revenue from arrangements that fall within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. We present revenues from collaboration and licensing arrangements separately from other sources of revenue.\nAmounts received by us as non-refundable upfront payment under the Restated Collaboration Agreement prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets. Such amounts are recognized as revenue over the performance period of the respective services on a percent of completion basis for each of the obligations. Reimbursement of costs for or services under the Restated Collaboration Agreement are presented as revenue and not deducted from expenses. Amounts of consideration allocated to the performance of research or manufacturing services are recognized over the period in which services are performed. Contingent milestone payments related to specified preclinical and clinical development milestones are not initially recognized within the transaction price as they are fully constrained under the guidance in ASC 606. The Restated Collaboration Agreement also includes certain sales-based milestone and royalty payments upon successful commercialization of a licensed product which we anticipate recognizing if and when sales from a licensed product are generated.\nLeasing\nThe determination whether an arrangement is qualified as a lease is made at contract inception. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based upon the present value of lease payments over the lease term. When determining the lease term, we include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable and our incremental borrowing rate when the implicit rate is not readily determinable based upon the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using a secured borrowing rate for the same currency and term as the associated lease. The lease payments used to determine operating lease assets may include lease incentives, stated rent increases and escalation clauses linked to rates of inflation when determinable and are recognized as operating lease assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Certain of our arrangements contain lease and non-lease components. We applied an accounting policy choice to separate or not to separate lease payments for the identified assets from any non-lease payments included in the contract by asset class. Operating leases are reflected in operating lease assets, in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and in non-current operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including salaries and bonuses, stock-based compensation, employee benefits, facilities costs, laboratory supplies, depreciation, manufacturing expenses and external costs of vendors engaged to conduct preclinical development activities and clinical trials as well as the cost of licensing technology. Advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nAll patent-related costs incurred in connection with filing and prosecuting patent applications are classified as research and development expenses and expensed as incurred due to the uncertainty about the recovery of the expenditure. Upfront payments, milestone payments and annual payments made for the licensing of technology are generally expensed as research and development in the period in which they are incurred. Incremental sublicense fees triggered by contracts with customers are capitalized and expensed as research and development expenses over the period in which the relating revenue is recognized.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure all stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We classify stock-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the same manner in which the award recipient's payroll costs are classified. Generally, we issue stock options, with service-only vesting conditions and record expense using the graded-vesting method.\nWe estimate the fair value of each stock option award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. We do not estimate and apply a forfeiture rate as we have elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.\nRecognition of other income under government grant agreements and research incentives\nWe recognize income from grants, research incentives and the imputed benefit arising from the difference between an estimated market rate of interest and the contractual interest rate on loans received from Austrian government agencies. Income from grants and incentives is recognized in the period during which the related qualifying expenses are incurred, provided that the conditions under which the grants or incentives were provided have been met. For grants under funding agreements and for proceeds under research incentive programs, we recognize grant and incentive income in an amount equal to the qualifying expenses incurred in each period multiplied by the applicable reimbursement percentage.\nGrant income that we have received in advance of incurring qualifying expenses is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as deferred income. Grant and incentive income recognized upon incurring qualifying expenses in advance of receipt of grant funding or proceeds from research and development incentives is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nWe have received loans under funding agreements that bear interest below market rates. We account for the imputed benefit arising from the difference between an estimated market interest rate and the actual interest rate charged on such loans as additional grant income, and record interest expense for the loans at a market interest. On the date that loan proceeds are received, we recognize the portion of the loan proceeds allocated to grant funding as a discount to the carrying value of the loan and as unearned income, which is subsequently recognized as additional grant income over the term of the funding agreement.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nA description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEmerging Growth Company Status and Smaller Reporting Company\nAs an emerging growth company,\u201d the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 allows us to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until such standards are made applicable to private companies. However, we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe are also a smaller reporting company\u201d meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million and our annual revenue was less than $100 million during our most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. For so long as we\nremain a smaller reporting company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure and other requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies.", "summary": "This report provides insight into the financial condition and operations of a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that is developing immunotherapeutics based on a proprietary arenavirus platform.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of immunotherapeutics based on our proprietary arenavirus platform that is designed to target and amplify a T cell and immune response to disease. Our replicating and non-replicating technologies are engineered to induce robust and durable antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses and pathogen-neutralizing antibodies. We believe that our technologies can meaningfully leverage the human\nimmune system for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes by inducing CD8+ T cell response levels previously not achieved by other immunotherapy approaches.\nWe are building a proprietary immuno-oncology pipeline by targeting oncoviral cancer antigens, self-antigens and next-generation antigens. Our oncology portfolio includes three disclosed programs, HB-200, HB-300 and HB-700, which all use our replicating technology. HB-200 is in clinical development for the treatment of Human Papillomavirus 16-positive (HPV16+) cancers in an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial. HB-300 is in development for the treatment of prostate cancer and expected to move into the clinic after the third quarter 2022 investigational new drug application filing. HB-700 is our newest asset in preclinical development for treatment of KRAS mutated cancers, including, lung, colorectal and pancreatic cancers.\nOur HB-200 program is comprised of HB-201 single vector therapy and HB-201/HB-202 two vector therapy. Both therapies are being evaluated in an ongoing HB-200 Phase 1/2 study. In November 2021, we announced interim data on our ongoing Phase 1 portion of the study, showing promising anti-tumor activity against advanced/metastatic HPV16+ cancers and favorable tolerability. Data demonstrated responses and stable disease in head and neck cancer patients who failed prior standard of care therapy. We believe that these early-stage data establish proof of concept for our replicating single-vector immunotherapy in oncology.\nIn January 2022, we dosed the first patient with a combination of HB-201 and pembrolizumab for the treatment of first line advanced/metastatic HPV16+ HNSCC in the Phase 2 expansion portion of the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial. In September 2021, we entered into a clinical collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc. to evaluate the combination of HB-200 and Merck & Co., Inc's anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA\u00ae (pembrolizumab) in a separate randomized Phase 2 study.\nOur non-replicating prophylactic Cytomegalovirus, or CMV, vaccine candidate, HB-101, is a potential first in-class compound in a Phase 2 clinical trial for patients awaiting kidney transplantation. In November 2021, we reported safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data, whereby the three-dose schedule of HB-101 pre-transplantation showed a trend of reducing incidence of CMV viremia and antiviral use. The trial will continue to follow patients currently on-study with final top-line data readout in the first half of 2023. We have decided to pursue HB-101 further only if we are able to partner the program with a collaborator, thereby enabling greater strategic focus on the immuno-oncology programs.\nWe have funded our operations to date primarily from private placements of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, with aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $142.5 million, grant funding and loans from an Austrian government agency, and $26.2 million in upfront and milestone payments from Gilead in connection with a research collaboration and license agreement. On April 23, 2019, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock (IPO) in which we issued 6.0 million shares of our common stock, at $14.00 per share, for gross proceeds of $84.0 million, or net proceeds of $74.6 million. On December 11, 2020, we completed a follow-on public offering in which we issued 3.9 million shares of our common stock, at $11.75 per share, and 2,978 shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock, at $11,750.00 per share, for net proceeds of $75.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. As of December 31, 2021, the principal amount outstanding under loans from government agencies was $6.1 million and we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $66.9 million. In February 2022 we received a $15.0 million initiation fee in connection with Restated Collaboration Agreement with Gilead. In addition, Gilead purchased unregistered shares of our common stock for $5.0 million. In March 2022, we issued and sold 21,700,000 shares of our common stock at $2.00 per share, and 15,800 shares of our Series A-1 convertible preferred stock at $2,000.00 per share in a follow-on public offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately $70.0 million.\nWe do not expect to generate revenue from any product candidates that we develop until we obtain regulatory approval for one or more of such product candidates, if at all, and commercialize our products or enter into additional collaboration agreements with third parties. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.\nAll of our product candidates, including our most advanced oncology product candidate, HB-200, will require substantial additional development time and resources before we would be able to apply for and receive regulatory approvals and begin generating revenue from product sales. Before launching our first products, if approved, we plan to establish our own manufacturing facility to reduce or eliminate our reliance on contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) which will require substantial capital expenditures and cause additional operating expenses. We currently have no marketing and sales organization and have no experience in marketing products; accordingly, we will incur significant expenses to develop a marketing organization and sales force in advance of generating any commercial product sales. As a result, we will need substantial additional capital to support our operating activities. In addition, we expect to continue to incur legal, accounting and other expenses in operating our business, including the costs associated with operating as a public company.\nWe currently anticipate that we will seek to fund our operations through equity or debt financings or other sources, such as government grants and additional collaboration agreements with third parties. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If sufficient funds on acceptable terms are not available when needed, we will be required to significantly reduce our operating expenses and delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs.\nWe have incurred net losses each year since our inception in 2011, including net losses of $75.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $44.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $222.8 million and we do not expect positive cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future, if ever. We expect to continue to incur net operating losses for at least the next several years as we advance our product candidates through clinical development, seek regulatory approval, prepare for and, if approved, proceed to commercialization, continue our research and development efforts and invest to establish a commercial manufacturing facility.\nWe believe that the net proceeds from our offering in March 2022, the funds received under Restated Collaboration Agreement with Gilead, both described below, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at least through the next 12 months from the issuance date of the consolidated financial statement. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nSpecial Note About Coronavirus (COVID-19)\nIn March 2020, we announced initial potential business impacts related to the outbreak of a novel strain of virus named SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome 2), or coronavirus, which causes coronavirus disease, or COVID-19. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced, and may further experience, disruptions that have and could further adversely impact our business operations as well as our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Specifically, nearly all of the Phase 2 trial sites we utilize for our HB-101 Phase 2 trial had temporarily suspended enrollment of patients, resumed patient enrollment, but suspended enrollment again during periods of increased confirmed infections in the United States and Europe. As a result, the total number of patients in the trial at the conclusion of enrollment in June 2021 was below the originally planned number of patients.\nIn addition, certain aspects of our supply chain were temporarily impacted as certain of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers had paused their operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or had otherwise encountered delays in providing their services. The uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have led us to temporarily focus on our core program, HB-200, as well as research and development activities under our collaboration with Gilead. Certain earlier stage programs, including HB-300 were temporarily de-prioritized only allocated the resources that could be made available without impacting our core programs. While we have resumed activities for these earlier stage programs in 2021, we continue to evaluate the extent to which potential constraints of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers will impact our ability to manufacture our product candidates for our clinical trials and conduct other research and development operations and maintain applicable timelines. The ultimate impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our business operations as well as our preclinical studies and clinical trials remains uncertain and subject to change and will depend on future developments, which cannot be accurately predicted. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.\nFurthermore, in order to preserve resources and liquidity, all of our officers had waived at least 25% of their cash salaries for the three months ended June 30, 2020, and the vast majority of our employees agreed to a temporary salary reduction of 20% for the three months ended June 30, 2020. We compensated our officers and employees for the forgone cash salaries by issuing restricted stock units in July 2020. Our directors have also accepted to receive equity instead of cash for their accrued board fees. We encourage our staff to work from home where possible, and encourage our Vienna employees to make use of the readily-available PCR testing in order to enhance health and safety, in particular for laboratory work that has to be performed on site. Since October 2021 we have required our employees to be either fully vaccinated, cured from a COVID-19 infection or to have obtained a negative PCR-test to enter our offices.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue from collaboration and licensing\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to do so in the near future, if at all. All of our revenue to date has been derived from a research collaboration and license agreement with Gilead.\nOn June 4, 2018, we entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement, with Gilead to evaluate potential vaccine products using or incorporating our replicating technology and non-replicating technology for the treatment, cure, diagnosis or prevention of HBV and HIV.\nUnder the Collaboration Agreement, we granted Gilead an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to our technology platform for researching, developing, manufacturing and commercializing products for HIV or HBV. We received a non-refundable $10.0 million upfront payment upon entering the Collaboration Agreement. In February 2022, we signed an amended and restated collaboration agreement, the Restated Collaboration Agreement, which revised the terms only for the HIV program, whereby we will take on development responsibilities for the HIV program candidate through a Phase 1b clinical trial. Pursuant to the Restated Collaboration Agreement, Gilead will retain an exclusive right, the Option, to take back the rights for the HIV program, including further development and commercialization in return for an option exercise payment of $10.0 million. Pursuant to the Restated Collaboration Agreement, we are eligible for up to $140.0 million in developmental milestone payments for the HBV program and $50.0 million in commercialization milestone payments. If Gilead exercises the Option, we are eligible for up to $167.5 million in developmental milestone payments for the HIV program, inclusive of the $10.0 million Option exercise payment, and $65.0 million in commercialization milestone payments for the HIV program. Upon the commercialization of a product, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties of a high single-digit to mid-teens percentage on the worldwide net sales of each HBV product, and royalties of a mid-single-digit to 10% of worldwide net sales of each HIV product. Gilead is obligated to reimburse us for our costs, including all benefits, travel, overhead, and any other expenses, relating to performing research and development activities under the Restated Collaboration Agreement with respect to the HBV program, and if the Option is exercised, the HIV program. Through to December 31, 2021, we have received from Gilead the non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million and $12.2 million in milestone payments for the achievement of pre-clinical research milestones. In addition, we have recognized $35.6 million of cost reimbursements for research and development services performed under the Collaboration Agreement. In the first quarter of 2022, we received an additional milestone payment of $4.0 million and the initiation payment of $15.0 million due upon execution of the Restated Collaboration Agreement to fund our future performance of development activities under the Restated Collaboration Agreement.\nWe determined that our performance obligations under the terms of the Restated Collaboration Agreement included one combined performance obligation for each of the HBV and HIV research programs, comprised of the transfer of intellectual property rights and providing research and development services. Accordingly, we recognize these amounts as revenue over the performance period of the respective services on a percent of completion basis using total estimated research and development labor hours for each of the performance obligations.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses since inception have only consisted of research and development costs and general administrative costs.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nSince our inception, we have focused significant resources on our research and development activities, including establishing our arenavirus platform, conducting preclinical studies, developing a manufacturing process, conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial and the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial for HB-101 as well as initiating a Phase 1/2 trial for HB-201 and preparing an investigational new drug, or IND, application for HB-202. Research and development activities account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These costs include:\n \u25cf salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel engaged in research and development functions; \n \u25cf expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical development of our programs and clinical trials of our product candidates, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors, academic institutions and contract research organizations (CROs); \n \u25cf the cost of manufacturing drug products for use in clinical trials, including under agreements with third parties, such as CMOs, consultants and contractors; \n \u25cf laboratory costs; \n \u25cf leased facility costs, equipment depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses; and \n \u25cf intellectual property costs incurred in connection with filing and prosecuting patent applications as well as third-party license fees. \nThe majority of our research and development costs are external costs, which we track on a program-by-program basis. We do not track our internal research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis as they primarily relate to shared costs deployed across multiple projects under development.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in the future as we advance our existing and future product candidates into and through clinical trials and pursue regulatory approval. The process of conducting the necessary clinical studies to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. Clinical trials generally become larger and more costly to conduct as they advance into later stages and, in the future, we will be required to make estimates for expense accruals related to clinical trial expenses.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any product candidates that we develop from our programs. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales of product candidates we develop, if at all. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates, including the uncertainty of:\n \u25cf successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials; \n \u25cf sufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials; \n \u25cf acceptance of INDs for our planned clinical trials or future clinical trials; \n \u25cf successful enrollment and completion of clinical trials; \n \u25cf successful data from our clinical program that support an acceptable risk-benefit profile of our product candidates in the intended populations; \n \u25cf receipt and maintenance of regulatory and marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u25cf scale-up of our manufacturing processes and formulation of our product candidates for later stages of development and commercialization; \n \u25cf establishing our own manufacturing capabilities or agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if our product candidate is approved; \n \u25cf entry into collaborations to further the development of our product candidates; \n \u25cf obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; \n \u25cf successfully launching commercial sales of our product candidates, if and when approved; \n \u25cf acceptance of the product candidates benefits and uses, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; \n \u25cf the prevalence and severity of adverse events experienced with our product candidates; \n \u25cf maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval; \n \u25cf effectively competing with other therapies; \n \u25cf obtaining and maintaining healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; and \n \u25cf qualifying for, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs in our executive, finance and investor relations, business development and administrative functions. Other general and administrative expenses include consulting fees and professional service fees for auditing, tax and legal services, lease expenses related to our offices, premiums for directors and officers liability insurance, depreciation and other costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in the future as we expand our operating activities and prepare for potential commercialization of our current and future product candidates, increase our headcount and investor relations activities and maintain compliance with requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nGrant Income\nSince inception, we have received grants from the Austrian Research Promotions Agency, either under funding agreements or under research incentive programs. In addition, we have received loans under funding agreements that\nbear interest at below market interest rate. We account for the grants received as other income and for the imputed benefits arising from the difference between a market rate of interest and the rate of interest as additional grant income, and record interest expense for the loans at a market rate of interest.\nWe participate in a research incentive program provided by the Austrian government under which we are entitled to reimbursement of a percentage of qualifying research and development expenses and capital expenditures incurred in Austria. Submissions for reimbursement under the program are submitted annually. Incentive amounts are generally paid out during the calendar year that follows the year of the expenses but remain subject to subsequent examinations by the responsible authority.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense results primarily from loans under funding agreements with the Austrian Research Promotion Agency, recorded at a market rate of interest. The difference between interest payments payable pursuant to the loans, which rates are at below market interest rates, and the market interest rate, is accounted for as grant income.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense results from foreign minimum income tax and profit on a legal entity basis. The losses that we have incurred since inception result primary from the losses of our Austrian subsidiary. As of December 31, 2021, we had a deferred tax asset of $58.8 million primarily resulting from foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $219.7 million with no expiry date. We have considered that, at this point in time, it is uncertain whether we will ever be able to realize the benefits of the deferred tax asset, and accordingly, have established a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2021.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\n\nRevenue from Collaboration and Licensing\nRevenue was $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe decrease of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to lower revenue from research milestones, and lower recognition of deferred revenue related to upfront and milestone payments, partially offset by higher cost reimbursements received under the Restated Collaboration Agreement with Gilead.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue included $16.3 million from reimbursement of research and development expenses, $0.6 million from partial recognition of deferred revenue related to the upfront payment of $10.0 million that we received in June 2018 and $1.5 million from partial recognition of the $4.0 million milestone payment that we received in 2020. In the year ended December 31, 2021 we completed the recognition of the deferred revenue related to the upfront payment of $10.0 million that we received in June 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue included $13.0 million from reimbursement of research and development expenses, $2.0 million from partial recognition of deferred revenue related to the upfront payment of $10.0 million that we received in June 2018 and $2.4 million from partial recognition of the $4.0 million milestone payment that we received in February 2020, as well as $2.2 million of revenue that was recognized upon the achievement of research milestones in June and December 2020.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our research and development expenses were $82.9 million, compared to $54.8 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe increase of $28.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to an increase in direct research and development expenses of $21.2 million, and an increase in internal research and development expenses of $6.9 million.\nThe primary drivers of the increase in direct research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 were an increase in manufacturing and quality control expenses of $9.9 million, an increase in clinical study expenses of $3.2 million, along with an increase in other direct expenses and laboratory expenses of $8.1 million. The increase was mainly due to the progress in the clinical trial of our HB-200 program, particularly, the increased patient recruitment and related clinical trial monitoring and testing activities, as well as manufacturing and quality control work in preparation of a further extension of the trial. Manufacturing and quality control expenses were also driven by the progress towards clinical development in our Gilead partnered programs and other preclinical programs.\nThe increase in internal research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses by $4.4 million, and an increase in facility related and other internal research and development expenses by $2.5 million. The increase in personnel-related research and development expenses resulted primarily from our increased research and development\nheadcount and an increase in stock compensation expenses. Other internal research and development costs and facility related costs also increased as a result of our expansion of research and development activities and headcount.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by product candidate or program (in thousands):\n (1) Expenses incurred by us in connection with Gilead partnered programs are reimbursed to us by Gilead and accounted for as revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $17.3 million, compared to $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe decrease of $0.8 million was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related expenses of $0.4 million, and a decrease in other general and administrative expenses of $0.6 million, partially offset by an increase in professional and consulting fees of $0.2 million. The decrease in personnel-related expenses resulted from decreased stock compensation expenses, partially offset by a growth in headcount along with increased salaries in our general and administrative functions.\nGrant Income\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021 we recorded grant income of $9.7 million, compared to $6.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from grants, research incentives and imputed benefits from below market interest rates on loans from governmental agencies. The increase of $3.2 million was primarily due to higher income from Austrian research and development incentives.\nInterest Income and Expense\nInterest income was less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease of $0.3 million, despite higher cash balances over almost the entire year, was due to the drop in interest rates in the United States and Europe. Interest income represents interest from cash and cash equivalents held in US dollars resulting from the proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock as well as payments received under our Collaboration Agreement with Gilead. During the year ended December 31, 2021 our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were mainly held in dollars at U.S. investment grade financial institutions or in money market funds. In addition, smaller amounts were held in euros at our Austrian subsidiary that produced no material interest income due to the low or zero interest rate policy in the European Monetary Union.\nInterest expenses for loans from government agencies were $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest expense was recorded at the market rate of interest, which exceeded the contractual interest.\nOther Income and Expenses\nOther expenses were $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to other income of $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of immunotherapeutics based on our proprietary arenavirus platform that is designed to target and amplify a T cell and immune response to disease. Our replicating and non-replicating technologies are engineered to induce robust and durable antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses and pathogen-neutralizing antibodies. We believe that our technologies can meaningfully leverage the human\nimmune system for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes by inducing CD8+ T cell response levels previously not achieved by other immunotherapy approaches.\nWe are building a proprietary immuno-oncology pipeline by targeting oncoviral cancer antigens, self-antigens and next-generation antigens. Our oncology portfolio includes three disclosed programs, HB-200, HB-300 and HB-700, which all use our replicating technology. HB-200 is in clinical development for the treatment of Human Papillomavirus 16-positive (HPV16+) cancers in an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial. HB-300 is in development for the treatment of prostate cancer and expected to move into the clinic after the third quarter 2022 investigational new drug application filing. HB-700 is our newest asset in preclinical development for treatment of KRAS mutated cancers, including, lung, colorectal and pancreatic cancers.\nOur HB-200 program is comprised of HB-201 single vector therapy and HB-201/HB-202 two vector therapy. Both therapies are being evaluated in an ongoing HB-200 Phase 1/2 study. In November 2021, we announced interim data on our ongoing Phase 1 portion of the study, showing promising anti-tumor activity against advanced/metastatic HPV16+ cancers and favorable tolerability. Data demonstrated responses and stable disease in head and neck cancer patients who failed prior standard of care therapy. We believe that these early-stage data establish proof of concept for our replicating single-vector immunotherapy in oncology.\nIn January 2022, we dosed the first patient with a combination of HB-201 and pembrolizumab for the treatment of first line advanced/metastatic HPV16+ HNSCC in the Phase 2 expansion portion of the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial. In September 2021, we entered into a clinical collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc. to evaluate the combination of HB-200 and Merck & Co., Inc's anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA\u00ae (pembrolizumab) in a separate randomized Phase 2 study.\nOur non-replicating prophylactic Cytomegalovirus, or CMV, vaccine candidate, HB-101, is a potential first in-class compound in a Phase 2 clinical trial for patients awaiting kidney transplantation. In November 2021, we reported safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data, whereby the three-dose schedule of HB-101 pre-transplantation showed a trend of reducing incidence of CMV viremia and antiviral use. The trial will continue to follow patients currently on-study with final top-line data readout in the first half of 2023. We have decided to pursue HB-101 further only if we are able to partner the program with a collaborator, thereby enabling greater strategic focus on the immuno-oncology programs.\nWe have funded our operations to date primarily from private placements of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, with aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $142.5 million, grant funding and loans from an Austrian government agency, and $26.2 million in upfront and milestone payments from Gilead in connection with a research collaboration and license agreement. On April 23, 2019, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock (IPO) in which we issued 6.0 million shares of our common stock, at $14.00 per share, for gross proceeds of $84.0 million, or net proceeds of $74.6 million. On December 11, 2020, we completed a follow-on public offering in which we issued 3.9 million shares of our common stock, at $11.75 per share, and 2,978 shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock, at $11,750.00 per share, for net proceeds of $75.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. As of December 31, 2021, the principal amount outstanding under loans from government agencies was $6.1 million and we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $66.9 million. In February 2022 we received a $15.0 million initiation fee in connection with Restated Collaboration Agreement with Gilead. In addition, Gilead purchased unregistered shares of our common stock for $5.0 million. In March 2022, we issued and sold 21,700,000 shares of our common stock at $2.00 per share, and 15,800 shares of our Series A-1 convertible preferred stock at $2,000.00 per share in a follow-on public offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately $70.0 million.\nWe do not expect to generate revenue from any product candidates that we develop until we obtain regulatory approval for one or more of such product candidates, if at all, and commercialize our products or enter into additional collaboration agreements with third parties. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.\nAll of our product candidates, including our most advanced oncology product candidate, HB-200, will require substantial additional development time and resources before we would be able to apply for and receive regulatory approvals and begin generating revenue from product sales. Before launching our first products, if approved, we plan to establish our own manufacturing facility to reduce or eliminate our reliance on contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) which will require substantial capital expenditures and cause additional operating expenses. We currently have no marketing and sales organization and have no experience in marketing products; accordingly, we will incur significant expenses to develop a marketing organization and sales force in advance of generating any commercial product sales. As a result, we will need substantial additional capital to support our operating activities. In addition, we expect to continue to incur legal, accounting and other expenses in operating our business, including the costs associated with operating as a public company.\nWe currently anticipate that we will seek to fund our operations through equity or debt financings or other sources, such as government grants and additional collaboration agreements with third parties. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If sufficient funds on acceptable terms are not available when needed, we will be required to significantly reduce our operating expenses and delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs.\nWe have incurred net losses each year since our inception in 2011, including net losses of $75.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $44.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $222.8 million and we do not expect positive cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future, if ever. We expect to continue to incur net operating losses for at least the next several years as we advance our product candidates through clinical development, seek regulatory approval, prepare for and, if approved, proceed to commercialization, continue our research and development efforts and invest to establish a commercial manufacturing facility.\nWe believe that the net proceeds from our offering in March 2022, the funds received under Restated Collaboration Agreement with Gilead, both described below, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at least through the next 12 months from the issuance date of the consolidated financial statement. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nSpecial Note About Coronavirus (COVID-19)\nIn March 2020, we announced initial potential business impacts related to the outbreak of a novel strain of virus named SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome 2), or coronavirus, which causes coronavirus disease, or COVID-19. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced, and may further experience, disruptions that have and could further adversely impact our business operations as well as our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Specifically, nearly all of the Phase 2 trial sites we utilize for our HB-101 Phase 2 trial had temporarily suspended enrollment of patients, resumed patient enrollment, but suspended enrollment again during periods of increased confirmed infections in the United States and Europe. As a result, the total number of patients in the trial at the conclusion of enrollment in June 2021 was below the originally planned number of patients.\nIn addition, certain aspects of our supply chain were temporarily impacted as certain of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers had paused their operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or had otherwise encountered delays in providing their services. The uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have led us to temporarily focus on our core program, HB-200, as well as research and development activities under our collaboration with Gilead. Certain earlier stage programs, including HB-300 were temporarily de-prioritized only allocated the resources that could be made available without impacting our core programs. While we have resumed activities for these earlier stage programs in 2021, we continue to evaluate the extent to which potential constraints of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers will impact our ability to manufacture our product candidates for our clinical trials and conduct other research and development operations and maintain applicable timelines. The ultimate impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our business operations as well as our preclinical studies and clinical trials remains uncertain and subject to change and will depend on future developments, which cannot be accurately predicted. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.\nFurthermore, in order to preserve resources and liquidity, all of our officers had waived at least 25% of their cash salaries for the three months ended June 30, 2020, and the vast majority of our employees agreed to a temporary salary reduction of 20% for the three months ended June 30, 2020. We compensated our officers and employees for the forgone cash salaries by issuing restricted stock units in July 2020. Our directors have also accepted to receive equity instead of cash for their accrued board fees. We encourage our staff to work from home where possible, and encourage our Vienna employees to make use of the readily-available PCR testing in order to enhance health and safety, in particular for laboratory work that has to be performed on site. Since October 2021 we have required our employees to be either fully vaccinated, cured from a COVID-19 infection or to have obtained a negative PCR-test to enter our offices.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue from collaboration and licensing\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to do so in the near future, if at all. All of our revenue to date has been derived from a research collaboration and license agreement with Gilead.\nOn June 4, 2018, we entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement, with Gilead to evaluate potential vaccine products using or incorporating our replicating technology and non-replicating technology for the treatment, cure, diagnosis or prevention of HBV and HIV.\nUnder the Collaboration Agreement, we granted Gilead an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to our technology platform for researching, developing, manufacturing and commercializing products for HIV or HBV. We received a non-refundable $10.0 million upfront payment upon entering the Collaboration Agreement. In February 2022, we signed an amended and restated collaboration agreement, the Restated Collaboration Agreement, which revised the terms only for the HIV program, whereby we will take on development responsibilities for the HIV program candidate through a Phase 1b clinical trial. Pursuant to the Restated Collaboration Agreement, Gilead will retain an exclusive right, the Option, to take back the rights for the HIV program, including further development and commercialization in return for an option exercise payment of $10.0 million. Pursuant to the Restated Collaboration Agreement, we are eligible for up to $140.0 million in developmental milestone payments for the HBV program and $50.0 million in commercialization milestone payments. If Gilead exercises the Option, we are eligible for up to $167.5 million in developmental milestone payments for the HIV program, inclusive of the $10.0 million Option exercise payment, and $65.0 million in commercialization milestone payments for the HIV program. Upon the commercialization of a product, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties of a high single-digit to mid-teens percentage on the worldwide net sales of each HBV product, and royalties of a mid-single-digit to 10% of worldwide net sales of each HIV product. Gilead is obligated to reimburse us for our costs, including all benefits, travel, overhead, and any other expenses, relating to performing research and development activities under the Restated Collaboration Agreement with respect to the HBV program, and if the Option is exercised, the HIV program. Through to December 31, 2021, we have received from Gilead the non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million and $12.2 million in milestone payments for the achievement of pre-clinical research milestones. In addition, we have recognized $35.6 million of cost reimbursements for research and development services performed under the Collaboration Agreement. In the first quarter of 2022, we received an additional milestone payment of $4.0 million and the initiation payment of $15.0 million due upon execution of the Restated Collaboration Agreement to fund our future performance of development activities under the Restated Collaboration Agreement.\nWe determined that our performance obligations under the terms of the Restated Collaboration Agreement included one combined performance obligation for each of the HBV and HIV research programs, comprised of the transfer of intellectual property rights and providing research and development services. Accordingly, we recognize these amounts as revenue over the performance period of the respective services on a percent of completion basis using total estimated research and development labor hours for each of the performance obligations.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses since inception have only consisted of research and development costs and general administrative costs.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nSince our inception, we have focused significant resources on our research and development activities, including establishing our arenavirus platform, conducting preclinical studies, developing a manufacturing process, conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial and the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial for HB-101 as well as initiating a Phase 1/2 trial for HB-201 and preparing an investigational new drug, or IND, application for HB-202. Research and development activities account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These costs include:\n \u25cf salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel engaged in research and development functions; \n \u25cf expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical development of our programs and clinical trials of our product candidates, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors, academic institutions and contract research organizations (CROs); \n \u25cf the cost of manufacturing drug products for use in clinical trials, including under agreements with third parties, such as CMOs, consultants and contractors; \n \u25cf laboratory costs; \n \u25cf leased facility costs, equipment depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses; and \n \u25cf intellectual property costs incurred in connection with filing and prosecuting patent applications as well as third-party license fees. \nThe majority of our research and development costs are external costs, which we track on a program-by-program basis. We do not track our internal research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis as they primarily relate to shared costs deployed across multiple projects under development.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in the future as we advance our existing and future product candidates into and through clinical trials and pursue regulatory approval. The process of conducting the necessary clinical studies to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. Clinical trials generally become larger and more costly to conduct as they advance into later stages and, in the future, we will be required to make estimates for expense accruals related to clinical trial expenses.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any product candidates that we develop from our programs. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales of product candidates we develop, if at all. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates, including the uncertainty of:\n \u25cf successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials; \n \u25cf sufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials; \n \u25cf acceptance of INDs for our planned clinical trials or future clinical trials; \n \u25cf successful enrollment and completion of clinical trials; \n \u25cf successful data from our clinical program that support an acceptable risk-benefit profile of our product candidates in the intended populations; \n \u25cf receipt and maintenance of regulatory and marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u25cf scale-up of our manufacturing processes and formulation of our product candidates for later stages of development and commercialization; \n \u25cf establishing our own manufacturing capabilities or agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if our product candidate is approved; \n \u25cf entry into collaborations to further the development of our product candidates; \n \u25cf obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; \n \u25cf successfully launching commercial sales of our product candidates, if and when approved; \n \u25cf acceptance of the product candidates benefits and uses, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; \n \u25cf the prevalence and severity of adverse events experienced with our product candidates; \n \u25cf maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval; \n \u25cf effectively competing with other therapies; \n \u25cf obtaining and maintaining healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; and \n \u25cf qualifying for, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs in our executive, finance and investor relations, business development and administrative functions. Other general and administrative expenses include consulting fees and professional service fees for auditing, tax and legal services, lease expenses related to our offices, premiums for directors and officers liability insurance, depreciation and other costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in the future as we expand our operating activities and prepare for potential commercialization of our current and future product candidates, increase our headcount and investor relations activities and maintain compliance with requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nGrant Income\nSince inception, we have received grants from the Austrian Research Promotions Agency, either under funding agreements or under research incentive programs. In addition, we have received loans under funding agreements that\nbear interest at below market interest rate. We account for the grants received as other income and for the imputed benefits arising from the difference between a market rate of interest and the rate of interest as additional grant income, and record interest expense for the loans at a market rate of interest.\nWe participate in a research incentive program provided by the Austrian government under which we are entitled to reimbursement of a percentage of qualifying research and development expenses and capital expenditures incurred in Austria. Submissions for reimbursement under the program are submitted annually. Incentive amounts are generally paid out during the calendar year that follows the year of the expenses but remain subject to subsequent examinations by the responsible authority.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense results primarily from loans under funding agreements with the Austrian Research Promotion Agency, recorded at a market rate of interest. The difference between interest payments payable pursuant to the loans, which rates are at below market interest rates, and the market interest rate, is accounted for as grant income.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense results from foreign minimum income tax and profit on a legal entity basis. The losses that we have incurred since inception result primary from the losses of our Austrian subsidiary. As of December 31, 2021, we had a deferred tax asset of $58.8 million primarily resulting from foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $219.7 million with no expiry date. We have considered that, at this point in time, it is uncertain whether we will ever be able to realize the benefits of the deferred tax asset, and accordingly, have established a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2021.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 350: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue from collaboration and licensing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 18,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 19,584\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (82,853)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (54,787)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17,269)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,082)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100,122)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (72,869)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (81,674)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (53,285)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grant income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,517\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 400\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (898)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (786)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and expenses, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,843)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,072\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,203\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss before tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (75,664)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (44,082)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (75,665)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (44,082)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue from Collaboration and Licensing\nRevenue was $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe decrease of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to lower revenue from research milestones, and lower recognition of deferred revenue related to upfront and milestone payments, partially offset by higher cost reimbursements received under the Restated Collaboration Agreement with Gilead.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue included $16.3 million from reimbursement of research and development expenses, $0.6 million from partial recognition of deferred revenue related to the upfront payment of $10.0 million that we received in June 2018 and $1.5 million from partial recognition of the $4.0 million milestone payment that we received in 2020. In the year ended December 31, 2021 we completed the recognition of the deferred revenue related to the upfront payment of $10.0 million that we received in June 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue included $13.0 million from reimbursement of research and development expenses, $2.0 million from partial recognition of deferred revenue related to the upfront payment of $10.0 million that we received in June 2018 and $2.4 million from partial recognition of the $4.0 million milestone payment that we received in February 2020, as well as $2.2 million of revenue that was recognized upon the achievement of research milestones in June and December 2020.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our research and development expenses were $82.9 million, compared to $54.8 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe increase of $28.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to an increase in direct research and development expenses of $21.2 million, and an increase in internal research and development expenses of $6.9 million.\nThe primary drivers of the increase in direct research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 were an increase in manufacturing and quality control expenses of $9.9 million, an increase in clinical study expenses of $3.2 million, along with an increase in other direct expenses and laboratory expenses of $8.1 million. The increase was mainly due to the progress in the clinical trial of our HB-200 program, particularly, the increased patient recruitment and related clinical trial monitoring and testing activities, as well as manufacturing and quality control work in preparation of a further extension of the trial. Manufacturing and quality control expenses were also driven by the progress towards clinical development in our Gilead partnered programs and other preclinical programs.\nThe increase in internal research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses by $4.4 million, and an increase in facility related and other internal research and development expenses by $2.5 million. The increase in personnel-related research and development expenses resulted primarily from our increased research and development\nheadcount and an increase in stock compensation expenses. Other internal research and development costs and facility related costs also increased as a result of our expansion of research and development activities and headcount.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by product candidate or program (in thousands):\nTable 351: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct research and development expenses by program:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HB-101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HB-201/202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,162\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gilead partnered programs(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,129\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other and earlier-stage programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,298\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sub-total direct expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,609\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal research and development expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel related (including stock-based compensation)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,833\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility related\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,224\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other internal costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,121\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sub-total internal expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,178\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 82,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 54,787\n</td> </tr>\n</table> (1) Expenses incurred by us in connection with Gilead partnered programs are reimbursed to us by Gilead and accounted for as revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $17.3 million, compared to $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe decrease of $0.8 million was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related expenses of $0.4 million, and a decrease in other general and administrative expenses of $0.6 million, partially offset by an increase in professional and consulting fees of $0.2 million. The decrease in personnel-related expenses resulted from decreased stock compensation expenses, partially offset by a growth in headcount along with increased salaries in our general and administrative functions.\nGrant Income\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021 we recorded grant income of $9.7 million, compared to $6.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from grants, research incentives and imputed benefits from below market interest rates on loans from governmental agencies. The increase of $3.2 million was primarily due to higher income from Austrian research and development incentives.\nInterest Income and Expense\nInterest income was less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease of $0.3 million, despite higher cash balances over almost the entire year, was due to the drop in interest rates in the United States and Europe. Interest income represents interest from cash and cash equivalents held in US dollars resulting from the proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock as well as payments received under our Collaboration Agreement with Gilead. During the year ended December 31, 2021 our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were mainly held in dollars at U.S. investment grade financial institutions or in money market funds. In addition, smaller amounts were held in euros at our Austrian subsidiary that produced no material interest income due to the low or zero interest rate policy in the European Monetary Union.\nInterest expenses for loans from government agencies were $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest expense was recorded at the market rate of interest, which exceeded the contractual interest.\nOther Income and Expenses\nOther expenses were $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to other income of $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
