MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and Business\u201d sections, as well as the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the Forward-Looking Statements\u201d sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe were formed in 2011 to invest in and manage Single Tenant Operational Real Estate, or STORE Property, which is our target market and the inspiration for our name. A STORE Property is a property location at which a company operates its business and generates sales and profits, which makes the location a profit center and, therefore, fundamentally important to that business. Due to the long-term nature of our leases, we focus our acquisition activity on properties that operate in industries we believe have long-term relevance, the majority of which are service industries. Our customers operate their businesses under a wide range of brand names or business concepts. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 760 brand names or business concepts in over 100 industries were represented in our investment portfolio. By acquiring the real estate from the operators and then leasing the real estate back to them, the operators become our long-term tenants, and we refer to them as our customers. Through the execution of these sale-leaseback transactions, we fill a need for our customers by providing them a source of long-term capital that enables them to avoid the need to incur debt and/or employ equity in order to finance the real estate that is essential to their business.\nWe are a Maryland corporation organized as an internally managed real estate investment trust, or REIT. As a REIT, we will generally not be subject to federal income tax to the extent that we distribute all of our taxable income to our stockholders and meet other requirements.\nOur shares of common stock have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since our initial public offering, or IPO, in November 2014 and trade under the ticker symbol STOR.\u201d\nSince our inception in 2011, we have selectively originated over $11.1 billion of real estate investments. As of December 31, 2020, our investment portfolio totaled approximately $9.6 billion, consisting of investments in 2,634 property locations across the United States. All of the real estate we acquire is held by our wholly owned subsidiaries, many of which are special purpose bankruptcy remote entities formed to facilitate the financing of our real estate. We predominantly acquire our single-tenant properties directly from our customers in sale-leaseback transactions where our customers sell us their operating properties and then simultaneously enter into long-term triple-net leases with us to lease the properties back. Accordingly, our properties are fully occupied and under lease from the moment we acquire them.\nWe generate our cash from operations primarily through the monthly lease payments, or base rent\u201d, we receive from our customers under their long-term leases with us. We also receive interest payments on loans receivable, which are a small part of our portfolio. We refer to the monthly scheduled lease and interest payments due from our customers as base rent and interest\u201d. Most of our leases contain lease escalations every year or every several years that are based on the lesser of the increase in the Consumer Price Index or a stated percentage (if such contracts are expressed on an annual basis, currently averaging approximately 1.9%), which allows the monthly lease payments we receive to increase somewhat in an inflationary economic environment. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 99% of our leases (based on base rent) were triple-net\u201d leases, which means that our customers are responsible for all of the operating costs such as maintenance, insurance and property taxes associated with the properties they lease from us, including any increases in those costs that may occur as a result of inflation. The remaining leases have some landlord responsibilities, generally related to maintenance and structural component replacement that may be required on such properties in the future, although we do not currently anticipate incurring significant capital expenditures or property-level operating costs under such leases. Because our properties are single-tenant properties, almost all of which are under long-term leases, it is not necessary for us to perform any significant ongoing leasing activities on our properties. As of December 31, 2020, the\nweighted average remaining term of our leases (calculated based on base rent) was approximately 14 years, excluding renewal options, which are exercisable at the option of our tenants upon expiration of their base lease term. Leases approximating 99% of our base rent as of that date provide for tenant renewal options (generally two to four five-year options) and leases approximating 11% of our base rent provide our tenants the option, at their election, to purchase the property from us at a specified time or times (generally at the greater of the then-fair market value or our cost, as defined in the lease contracts).\nWe have dedicated an internal team to review and analyze ongoing tenant financial performance, both at the corporate level and at each property we own, in order to identify properties that may no longer be part of our long-term strategic plan. As part of that continuous active-management process, we may decide to sell properties where we believe the property no longer fits within our plan. Because generally we have been able to acquire assets and originate new leases at lease rates above the online commercial real estate auction marketplace, we have been able to sell these assets on both opportunistic and strategic bases, typically for a gain. This gain acts to partially offset any possible losses we may experience in the real estate portfolio.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nDuring 2020 and continuing into 2021, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has primarily impacted us through government mandated limits (i.e., required closing or limits on operations and social distancing requirements) imposed on our tenants' businesses and continuing public perceptions regarding safety, which impacted our tenants' ability to pay their rent to us. We took a number of mitigation steps in response to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. We were able to immediately transition to a remote working environment and our 106 employees have collectively taken steps to manage the impact to us, carrying on daily operations remotely. We communicated most frequently through video conferencing software, both internally and with external parties, which has been an essential tool to maintain an important team environment. In order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of the uncertainties in the markets at the onset of the pandemic, we borrowed an additional $450 million on our unsecured revolving credit facility in March 2020. We repaid this amount in full in August 2020 and, as of December 31, 2020, we had no amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nTo assist our tenants during the pandemic, we worked directly with our tenants to help them continue to meet their rent payment obligations to us, including providing short-term rent deferral arrangements. These arrangements included a structured rent relief program through which we allowed tenants that were highly and adversely impacted by the pandemic to defer the payment of their rent on a short-term basis. Rent relief repayment is primarily structured through short-term, interest-bearing notes. Through December 31, 2020, we have recognized net revenue aggregating approximately $57.1 million related to these deferral arrangements and collected $9.9 million in repayments of the amounts deferred. The remaining receivables are expected to be repaid over the next 36 months with the majority being repaid prior to the end of 2021.\nCurrently, most states have lifted the most onerous restrictions that have significantly impacted economic activity; however, the economic impact of COVID-19 is expected to continue over the near term and may continue throughout 2021, depending on state and local outbreaks and the availability and acceptance of effective vaccines. As restrictions are lifted, our tenants have gradually increased their business activity and, therefore, have improved their ability to meet their financial obligations to us under their lease contracts. As a result, our rent and interest collections have increased from 70% in May 2020 to 93% in February 2021. Further, nearly all of our properties have reopened for business with movie theaters remaining as the industry most impacted by social distancing measures.\nAlthough 99% of our leases are triple net, meaning that our tenants are generally responsible for the property-level operating costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance, we may be required make the property tax payment on behalf of the tenant if they are unable to do so. We experienced an increase in property costs during 2020, primarily related to property taxes on tenant locations where we expect the tenant may not be able to pay them when due.\nThe Company continues to closely monitor unpredictable factors that could impact its business going forward, including the duration of the pandemic; governmental, business and individual actions in response to the pandemic, including the vaccination process; and the overall impact on broad economic activity.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, our investment portfolio stood at approximately $9.6 billion, consisting of investments in 2,634 property locations. Substantially all of our cash from operations is generated by our investment portfolio.\nOur primary cash expenditures are the principal and interest payments we make on the debt we use to finance our real estate investment portfolio and the general and administrative expenses of managing the portfolio and operating our business. Since substantially all of our leases are triple net, our tenants are generally responsible for the maintenance, insurance and property taxes associated with the properties they lease from us. When a property becomes vacant through a tenant default or expiration of the lease term with no tenant renewal, we incur the property costs not paid by the tenant, as well as those property costs accruing during the time it takes to locate a substitute tenant or sell the property. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted average remaining term of our leases was approximately 14 years and the lease contracts related to just 13 of our properties, representing less than 0.1% of our annual base rent and interest, are due to expire during 2021; 79% of our leases have ten years or more remaining in their base lease term. As of December 31, 2020, nine of our 2,634 properties were vacant and not subject to a lease, which represents a 99.7% occupancy rate. We expect to incur some property-level operating costs from time to time in periods during which properties that become vacant are being remarketed. In addition, we may recognize an expense for certain property costs, such as real estate taxes billed in arrears, if we believe the tenant is likely to vacate the property before making payment on those obligations or be able to pay such costs in a timely manner. Property costs are generally not significant to our operations, but the amount of property costs can vary quarter to quarter based on the timing of property vacancies and the level of underperforming properties. During 2020, we experienced an increase in property costs, primarily related to tenants highly impacted by COVID-19, where the likelihood of STORE being required to make a property tax payment on behalf of the tenant was higher. Increased property costs may continue for some portion of 2021 due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic. Absent the pandemic, we may advance certain property costs on behalf of our tenants but expect that the majority of these costs will be reimbursed by the tenant and do not anticipate that they will be significant to our operations.\nIn order to preserve financial flexibility during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, we fully drew down our credit facility (which we subsequently repaid in August 2020) and temporarily reduced our new property acquisition activity. As we continue to gain better visibility into the path to recovery from the pandemic, we intend to continue to grow through additional real estate investments. To accomplish this objective, we must continue to identify real estate acquisitions that are consistent with our underwriting guidelines and raise future additional capital to make such acquisitions. We acquire real estate with a combination of debt and equity capital, proceeds from the sale of properties and cash from operations that is not otherwise distributed to our stockholders in the form of dividends. When we sell properties, we generally reinvest the cash proceeds from those sales in new property acquisitions. We also periodically commit to fund the construction of new properties for our customers or to provide them funds to improve and/or renovate properties we lease to them. These additional investments will generally result in increases to the rental revenue or interest income due under the related contracts. As of December 31, 2020, we had commitments to our customers to fund improvements to owned or mortgaged real estate properties totaling approximately $119.1 million, the majority of which is expected to be funded in the next twelve months.\nFinancing Strategy\nOur debt capital is initially provided on a short-term, temporary basis through a multi-year, variable-rate unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks. We manage our long-term leverage position through the strategic and economic issuance of long-term fixed-rate debt on both a secured and unsecured basis. By matching the expected cash inflows from our long-term real estate leases with the expected cash outflows of our long-term fixed-rate debt, we lock in\u201d, for as long as is economically feasible, the expected positive difference between our scheduled cash inflows on the leases and the cash outflows on our debt payments. By locking in this difference, or spread, we seek to reduce the risk that increases in interest rates would adversely impact our profitability. In addition, we may use various financial instruments designed to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies such as interest rate swaps and caps, depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. We also ladder our debt maturities in order to minimize the gap between our free cash flow (which we define as our cash from operations less dividends plus proceeds from our sale of properties) and our annual debt maturities; we have no significant debt maturities through 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2020, all our long-term debt was fixed-rate debt or was effectively converted to a fixed-rate for the term of the debt and our weighted average debt maturity was 6.6 years. As part of our long-term debt strategy, we develop and maintain broad access to multiple debt sources. We believe that having access to multiple debt markets increases our financing flexibility because different debt markets may attract different kinds of investors, thus expanding our access to a larger pool of potential debt investors. Also, a particular debt market may be more competitive than another at any particular point in time.\nThe long-term debt we have issued to date is comprised of both secured non-recourse borrowings, the vast majority of which is investment-grade rated, and senior investment-grade unsecured borrowings. We are currently rated Baa2 , BBB and BBB by Moody's Investors Service, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, respectively. In conjunction with our investment-grade debt strategy, we target a level of debt net of cash and cash equivalents that approximates 5\u00bd to 6 times our estimated annualized amount of earnings (excluding gains or losses on sales of real estate and provisions for impairment) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (based on our current investment portfolio).\nOur secured non-recourse borrowings are obtained through multiple debt markets - primarily the asset-backed securities debt market. The vast majority of our secured non-recourse borrowings were made through an investment-grade-rated debt program we designed, which we call our Master Funding debt program. By design, this program provides flexibility not commonly found in most secured non-recourse debt and which is described in Non-recourse Secured Debt below. To a lesser extent, we may also obtain fixed-rate non-recourse mortgage financing through the commercial mortgage-backed securities debt market or from banks and insurance companies secured by specific properties we pledge as collateral.\nOur goal is to employ a prudent blend of secured non-recourse debt through our flexible Master Funding debt program, paired with senior unsecured debt that uses our investment grade credit ratings. By balancing the mix of secured and unsecured debt, we can effectively leverage those properties subject to the secured debt in the range of 60%-70% and, at the same time, target a more conservative level of overall corporate leverage by maintaining a large pool of properties that are unencumbered. As of December 31, 2020, our secured non-recourse borrowings had a weighted average loan-to-cost ratio of approximately 64% and approximately 37% of our investment portfolio serves as collateral for this long-term debt. The remaining 63% of our portfolio properties, aggregating approximately $6.1 billion at December 31, 2020, are unencumbered and this unencumbered pool of properties provides us the flexibility to access long-term unsecured borrowings. The result is that our growing unencumbered pool of properties can provide higher levels of debt service coverage on the senior unsecured debt than would be the case if we employed only unsecured debt at our overall corporate leverage level. We believe this debt strategy can lead to a lower cost of capital for the Company, especially as we can issue AAA rated debt from our Master Funding debt program, as described further below.\nThe availability of debt to finance commercial real estate in the United States can, at times, be impacted by economic and other factors that are beyond our control. An example of adverse economic factors occurred during the recession of 2007 to 2009 when availability of debt capital for commercial real estate was significantly curtailed. We seek to reduce the risk that long-term debt capital may be unavailable to us by maintaining the flexibility to issue long-term debt in multiple debt capital markets, both secured and unsecured, and by limiting the period between the time we acquire our real estate and the time we finance our real estate with long-term debt. In addition, we have arranged our unsecured revolving credit facility to have a multi-year term with extension options in order to reduce the risk that short-term real estate financing would not be available to us. As we grow our real estate portfolio, we also intend to manage our debt maturities to reduce the risk that a significant amount of our debt will mature in any single year in the future. Because our long-term secured debt generally requires monthly payments of principal, in addition to the monthly interest payments, the resulting principal amortization also reduces our refinancing risk upon maturity of the debt. As our outstanding debt matures, we may refinance the maturing debt as it comes due or choose to repay it using cash and cash equivalents or our unsecured revolving credit facility. For example, as part of the STORE Master Funding Series 2018-1 notes issuance in October 2018, we prepaid, without penalty, an aggregate of $233.3 million of STORE Master Funding Series 2013-1 and Series 2013-2 Class A-1 notes that were scheduled to mature in 2020. Also, as part of the STORE Master Funding Series 2019-1 notes issuance in November 2019, we prepaid, without penalty, an aggregate of $186.1 million of STORE Master Funding Series 2013-3 and Series 2014-1 Class A-1 notes. In addition, as part of our third issuance of senior unsecured public notes in November 2020, we prepaid, without penalty, $92.3 million of STORE Master Funding Series 2015-1 Class A-1 notes and one of our $100 million bank term loans. Similar to the STORE Master Funding prepayments\ndescribed above, we may prepay other existing long-term debt in circumstances where we believe it would be economically advantageous to do so.\nUnsecured Revolving Credit Facility\nTypically, we use our $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility to acquire our real estate properties, until those borrowings are sufficiently large to warrant the economic issuance of long-term fixed-rate debt, the proceeds from which we use to repay the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we borrowed an additional $450 million on our unsecured revolving credit facility in March 2020 to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of the uncertainties in the markets at that time; we repaid this amount in full in August 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had no amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nOur unsecured revolving credit facility also has an accordion feature of $800 million, which gives us a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.4 billion. The facility matures in February 2022 and includes two six-month extension options, subject to certain conditions. Borrowings under the facility require monthly payments of interest at a rate selected by us of either (1) LIBOR plus a credit spread ranging from 0.825% to 1.55%, or (2) the Base Rate, as defined in the credit agreement, plus a credit spread ranging from 0.00% to 0.55%. The credit spread used is based on our credit rating as defined in the credit agreement. We are also required to pay a facility fee on the total commitment amount ranging from 0.125% to 0.30%. The currently applicable credit spread for LIBOR-based borrowings is 1.00% and the facility fee is 0.20%.\nUnder the terms of the facility, we are subject to various restrictive financial and nonfinancial covenants which, among other things, require us to maintain certain leverage ratios, cash flow and debt service coverage ratios, secured borrowing ratios and a minimum level of tangible net worth. Certain of these ratios are based on our pool of unencumbered assets, which aggregated approximately $6.1 billion at December 31, 2020. The facility is recourse to us and, as of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the financial and nonfinancial covenants under the facility and do not anticipate any compliance issues in the foreseeable future.\nSenior Unsecured Term Debt\nIn November 2020, we completed our third issuance of underwritten public notes in an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million and, as of December 31, 2020, we had an aggregate principal amount of $1.05 billion of underwritten public notes outstanding. These senior unsecured notes bear a weighted average coupon rate of 3.96% and interest on these notes is paid semi-annually in March and September or May and November of each year. The supplemental indentures governing our public notes contain various restrictive covenants, including limitations on our ability to incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with these covenants and expect to remain in compliance in the foreseeable future. Prior to our inaugural issuance of public debt in March 2018, our unsecured long-term debt had been issued through the private placement of notes to institutional investors and through groups of lenders who also participate in our unsecured revolving credit facility; the financial covenants of the privately placed notes and the remaining bank term loan are similar to our unsecured revolving credit facility. The aggregate outstanding principal amount of our unsecured senior notes and term loans payable was $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nNon-recourse Secured Debt\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 33% of our real estate investment portfolio served as collateral for outstanding borrowings under our STORE Master Funding debt program. We believe our STORE Master Funding program allows for flexibility not commonly found in non-recourse debt, often making it preferable to traditional debt issued in the commercial mortgage-backed securities market. Under the program, STORE serves as both master and special servicer for the collateral pool, allowing for active portfolio monitoring and prompt issue resolution. In addition, features of the program allowing for the sale or substitution of collateral, provided certain criteria are met, facilitate active portfolio management. Through this debt program, we arrange for bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity subsidiaries to issue multiple series of investment-grade asset-backed net-lease mortgage notes, or ABS notes, from time to time as\nadditional collateral is added to the collateral pool and leverage can be added in incremental note issuances based on the value of the collateral pool.\nThe ABS notes are generally issued by our wholly owned special purpose entity subsidiaries to institutional investors through the asset-backed securities market. These ABS notes are typically issued in two classes, Class A and Class B. At the time of issuance, the Class A notes represent approximately 70% of the appraised value of the underlying real estate collateral owned by the issuing subsidiaries and are currently rated AAA or A+ by S&P Global Ratings. The Series 2018-1 transaction in October 2018 marked our inaugural issuance of AAA rated notes and we believe it broadens the market for our STORE Master Funding debt program and gives us access to lower cost secured debt. In November 2019, our consolidated special purpose entities issued the ninth series, Series 2019-1, representing $508 million of net-lease mortgage notes under the STORE Master Funding debt program.\nThe Series 2019-1 transaction marked our inaugural issuance of 15-year notes, included $326 million of AAA rated notes and served to solidify our belief that the market for the STORE Master Funding program is broadening. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Class A notes were primarily used to pay down outstanding balances on our credit facility and to prepay, without penalty, STORE Master Funding Series 2013-3 and Series 2014-1 Class A-1 notes aggregating approximately $186.1 million at the time of prepayment; these notes were scheduled to mature in 2020 and 2021 and bore a weighted average interest rate of 4.2%.\nThe Class B notes, which are subordinated to the Class A notes as to principal repayment, represent approximately 5% of the appraised value of the underlying real estate collateral and are currently rated BBB by S&P Global Ratings. As of December 31, 2020, there was an aggregate $155.0 million in principal amount of Class B notes outstanding. We have historically retained these Class B notes and they are held by one of our bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity subsidiaries. The Class B notes are not reflected in our financial statements because they eliminate in consolidation. Since the Class B notes are considered issued and outstanding, they provide us with additional financial flexibility in that we may sell them to a third party in the future or use them as collateral for short-term borrowings as we have done from time to time in the past.\nThe ABS notes outstanding at December 31, 2020 totaled $2.0 billion in Class A principal amount and were supported by a collateral pool of approximately $3.2 billion representing 1,121 property locations operated by 207 customers. The amount of debt that can be issued in any new series is determined by the structure of the transaction and the aggregate amount of collateral in the pool at the time of issuance. In addition, the issuance of each new series of notes is subject to the satisfaction of several conditions, including that there is no event of default on the existing note series and that the issuance will not result in an event of default on, or the credit rating downgrade of, the existing note series.\nA significant portion of our cash flow is generated by the special purpose entities comprising our STORE Master Funding debt program. For the year ended December 31, 2020, excess cash flow, after payment of debt service and servicing and trustee expenses, totaled $94 million on cash collections of $233 million, which represents an overall ratio of cash collections to debt service, or debt service coverage ratio (as defined in the program documents), of nearly 1.7 to 1 on the STORE Master Funding program. For purposes of this debt service coverage ratio calculation, cash collections include the rent paid by tenants using the cash proceeds from short-term notes provided by a STORE Capital subsidiary in connection with the short-term rent deferral arrangements structured as part of our COVID-19 rent relief efforts. If at any time the debt service coverage ratio generated by the collateral pool is less than 1.3 to 1, excess cash flow from the STORE Master Funding entities will be deposited into a reserve account to be used for payments to be made on the net lease mortgage notes, to the extent there is a shortfall. We currently expect to remain above program minimum debt service coverage ratios for the foreseeable future.\nTo a lesser extent, we also may obtain debt in discrete transactions through other bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity subsidiaries, which debt is solely secured by specific real estate assets and is generally non-recourse to us (subject to certain customary limited exceptions). These discrete borrowings are generally in the form of traditional mortgage notes payable, with principal and interest payments due monthly and balloon payments due at their respective maturity dates, which typically range from seven to ten years from the date of issuance. Our secured borrowings contain various covenants customarily found in mortgage notes, including a limitation on the issuing entity's ability to incur\nadditional indebtedness on the underlying real estate. Certain of the notes also require the posting of cash reserves with the lender or trustee if specified coverage ratios are not maintained by the special purpose entity or the tenant.\nDebt Summary\nAs of December 31, 2020, our aggregate secured and unsecured long-term debt had an outstanding principal balance of $3.8 billion, a weighted average maturity of 6.6 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.2%. The following is a summary of the outstanding balance of our borrowings as well as a summary of the portion of our real estate investment portfolio that is either pledged as collateral for these borrowings or is unencumbered as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross Investment Portfolio Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Special Purpose\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Entity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>All Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Subsidiaries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Subsidiaries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>STORE Master Funding net-lease mortgage notes payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other mortgage notes payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 351\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-recourse debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured notes and term loans payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total unsecured debt (including revolving credit facility)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unencumbered real estate assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 8,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 9,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our decision to use either senior unsecured term debt, STORE Master Funding or other non-recourse traditional mortgage loan borrowings depends on our view of the most strategic blend of unsecured versus secured debt that is needed to maintain our targeted level of overall corporate leverage as well as on borrowing costs, debt terms, debt flexibility and the tenant and industry diversification levels of our real estate assets. As we continue to acquire real estate, we expect to balance the overall degree of leverage on our portfolio by growing our pool of portfolio assets that are unencumbered. Our growing pool of unencumbered assets will increase our financial flexibility by providing us with assets that can support senior unsecured financing or that can serve as substitute collateral for existing debt. Should market factors, which are beyond our control, adversely impact our access to these debt sources at economically feasible rates, our ability to grow through additional real estate acquisitions will be limited to any undistributed amounts available from our operations and any additional equity capital raises.\nEquity\nWe access the equity markets in various ways. As part of these efforts, we have established at the market\u201d equity distribution programs, or ATM programs, pursuant to which, from time to time, we may offer and sell registered shares of our common stock through a group of banks acting as our sales agents. Most recently, in November 2020, we established a $900 million ATM program (the 2020 ATM Program) and terminated the prior program (the 2019 ATM Program).\nThe following tables outline the common stock issuances under our programs (in millions except share and per share information):\nTable 89: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ATM Program\n</td> <td>Shares Sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Price per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross Proceeds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales Agents' Commissions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other Offering Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Proceeds\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$900 million 2019 ATM Program\n</td> <td> 22,177,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 26.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 582.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (7.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (0.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 575.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$900 million 2020 ATM Program\n</td> <td> 3,519,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 32.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 113.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td> 25,696,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 27.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 695.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (9.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (0.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 686.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Inception of Program Through December 31, 2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ATM Program\n</td> <td>Shares Sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Price per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross Proceeds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales Agents' Commissions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other Offering Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Proceeds\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$900 million 2019 ATM Program\n</td> <td> 27,203,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 28.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 782.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (9.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (0.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 773.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$900 million 2020 ATM Program\n</td> <td> 3,519,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 32.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 113.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td> 30,722,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 29.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 895.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (10.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (0.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 884.2\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Cash Flows\nSubstantially all of our cash from operations is generated by our investment portfolio. As shown in the following table, net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 decreased by $26.7 million over the $458.3 million reported in 2019; increases in net cash from operations during 2020 provided as a result of the increase in the size of our real estate acquisitions portfolio, which generated additional rental revenue and interest income, were offset by the impact of the rent deferral arrangements granted to tenants in 2020. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 increased by $66.7 million over the $391.7 million reported in 2018. We intentionally reduced our investment activity early in 2020 due to the volatility in the capital markets stemming from the pandemic; as a result, our investments in real estate, loans and financing receivables during 2020 were $634.2 million lower than 2019 Investment activity did accelerate during the fourth quarter of 2020 which is expected to benefit operating cash flows in 2021. Investment activity in real estate, loans and financing receivables was primarily funded, in all years, with a combination of cash from operations, proceeds from the sale of real estate properties, proceeds from the issuance of stock and proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, which included secured debt issuances under our STORE Master Funding program in 2019 and 2018. Proceeds received from the sale of real estate properties in 2019 were $226.5 million higher than the proceeds received in 2020; during 2019 we sold 95 properties as compared to the sale of 77 properties in 2020. Net cash provided by financing activities was lower for 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily as a result of the proceeds, net of long-term debt repayments, from issuance of long-term debt during 2019 as compared to 2020 including net proceeds from the issuance of notes under our STORE Master Funding program offset by net paydown activity on our revolving credit facility during 2019. Additionally, we paid dividends to our stockholders totaling $353.2 million in 2020, $307.2 million in 2019 and $255.6 million in 2018. We increased our quarterly dividend in the third quarter of 2020 by 2.9% to an annualized $1.44 per common share; we also increased our quarterly dividend by 6.1% in the third quarter of 2019 to an annualized $1.40 per common share.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 431,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 458,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 391,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (811,857)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,249,813)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,367,038)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 445,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 859,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 969,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,161)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 176,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 111,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 43,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had liquidity of $166.4 million on our balance sheet. Management believes that our current cash balance, the $600.0 million of immediate borrowing capacity on our unsecured revolving credit facility, the cash generated by our operations as well as the $800.0 million of liquidity available to us under the accordion feature of the credit facility, is more than sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future and allow us to acquire the real estate for which we currently have made commitments. In order to continue to grow our real estate portfolio in the future beyond the excess cash generated by our operations and our ability to borrow, we would expect to raise additional equity capital through the sale of our common stock.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table provides information with respect to our contractual commitments as of December 31, 2020, including any guaranteed or minimum commitments under contractual obligations.\nTable 91: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2021)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2022 - 2023)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2024 - 2025)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(after 2025)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit facility (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (secured and unsecured):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,762,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 146,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 427,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 720,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,468,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,001,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 156,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 295,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 231,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 317,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments to customers (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 119,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 106,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating ground lease obligations paid by STORE Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating ground lease obligations paid by STORE Capital's tenants (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate office operating lease obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,956,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 413,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 746,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 959,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,837,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td>(1) </td> <td>We had no amounts outstanding on our $600 million credit facility as of December 31, 2020; amounts outstanding bear interest at one-month LIBOR plus a credit rating-based credit spread of 1.00%.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although management believes its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements. For more information on our accounting policies, please refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting for Real Estate Investments\nClassification and Cost\nWe record the acquisition of real estate properties at cost, including acquisition and closing costs. We allocate the cost of real estate properties to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated relative fair values. Intangible assets and liabilities acquired may include the value of existing in-place leases, above-market or below-market lease value of in-place leases and ground lease-related intangibles, as applicable. Management uses multiple sources to estimate fair value, including independent appraisals and information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence and its marketing and leasing activities. Certain of our lease contracts allow our tenants the option, at their election, to purchase the leased property from us at a specified time or times (generally at the greater of the then-fair market value or our cost, as defined in the lease contracts). Subsequent to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)(ASC Topic 842) on January 1, 2019, for real estate assets acquired through a sale-leaseback transaction and subject to a lease contract which contains a purchase option, we will account for such an acquisition as a financing arrangement and record the investment in loans and financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheet.\nIn-place lease intangibles are valued based on management's estimates of lost rent and carrying costs during the time it would take to locate a tenant if the property were vacant, considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating lost rent and carrying costs, management considers market rents, real estate taxes, insurance, costs to execute similar leases (including leasing commissions) and other related costs.\nThe fair value of any above-market or below-market lease is estimated based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and management's estimate of current market lease rates for the property, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease.\nImpairment\nWe review our real estate investments and related lease intangibles periodically for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through operations. Such events or changes in circumstances may include an expectation to sell certain assets in accordance with our long-term strategic plans. Management considers factors such as expected future undiscounted cash flows, discount rates, estimated residual value, market trends (such as the effects of leasing demand and competition) and other factors including bona fide purchase offers received from third parties in making this assessment. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment is calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. Estimating future cash flows is highly subjective and such estimates could differ materially from actual results.\nResults of Operations\nIn July 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2019-07, Codification Updates to SEC Sections-Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Final Rule Releases No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification, which makes a number of changes meant to simplify certain disclosures in financial condition and results of operations, particularly by eliminating year-to-year comparisons between prior periods previously disclosed. In complying with the relevant aspects of the rule covering the current year annual report, we now include disclosures on results of operations for fiscal year 2020 versus 2019 only. For discussion of our fiscal year 2019 compared to our fiscal year 2018 see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2020, our real estate investment portfolio had grown to approximately $9.6 billion, consisting of investments in 2,634 property locations in 49 states, operated by more than 500 customers in various industries. Approximately 93% of the real estate investment portfolio represents commercial real estate properties subject to long-term leases, approximately 7% represents mortgage loan and financing receivables on commercial real estate properties and a nominal amount represents loans receivable secured by our tenants' other assets.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nTable 95: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 694,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 665,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 28,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 169,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 158,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,589)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 242,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 221,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provisions for impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 507,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 464,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on dispositions of real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (61,368)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from non-real estate, equity method investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 213,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 285,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (72,484)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (123)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 212,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 284,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (72,361)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nThe increase in revenues year over year was driven primarily by the growth in the size of our real estate investment portfolio, which generated additional rental revenues and interest income. Our real estate investment portfolio grew from approximately $8.8 billion in gross investment amount representing 2,504 properties at the end of 2019 to approximately $9.6 billion in gross investment amount representing 2,634 properties at December 31, 2020. The weighted average real estate investment amounts outstanding during the years were approximately $9.2 billion in 2020 and $8.2 billion in 2019. Our real estate investments were made throughout the years presented and were not all outstanding for the entire period; accordingly, a portion of the increase in revenues between years is related to recognizing a full year of revenue in 2020 on acquisitions that were made during 2019. Similarly, the full revenue impact of acquisitions made during 2020 will not be seen until 2021. This increase was partially offset by temporary rent reductions negotiated as part of our overall rent relief arrangements with our tenants most impacted by the pandemic and write-offs of rent receivables where we determined collectibility of the lease payments is not probable and the tenant was classified as cash basis\u201d as of December 31, 2020. At the close of 2020, approximately 5% of our base rent and interest relates to tenants on cash basis as compared to approximately 2% at December 31, 2019. Additionally, as a result of the onset of COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020, we reduced acquisition activity in the second and third quarters of the year, delaying a large portion of\n2020 acquisition volume to the fourth quarter. As a result, our large fourth quarter acquisition activity contributed little to 2020 revenues. A smaller component of the increase in revenues between years is related to rent escalations recognized on our lease contracts; over time, these rent increases can provide a strong source of revenue growth. Additionally, during 2020 and 2019, primarily in connection with the sale of certain properties, we collected $0.6 million and $4.1 million, respectively, in early lease termination payments which are included in other income.\nThe pandemic has primarily impacted us through government mandated limits imposed on our tenants' businesses and continuing public perceptions regarding safety, which impacted our tenants' ability to pay rent. Currently, we estimate that nearly all of our properties are open for business with movie theaters remaining as the most impacted industry. We have increased our monthly rent and interest collections from 70% in May 2020 to 93% in February 2021. We have worked with a number of our tenants on short-term rent deferral arrangements, including through a structured rent relief program under which we allowed such tenants to defer a portion of their rent, with repayment primarily structured through short-term, interest-bearing notes. Through December 31, 2020, we have recognized net revenue aggregating approximately $57.1 million related to these deferral arrangements; of the aggregate $57.1 million, $38.2 million was recognized in the second quarter, $13.1 million was recognized in the third quarter and $5.8 million was recognized in the fourth quarter. Through December 31, 2020, we have collected $9.9 million of these receivables; the remaining receivables are generally expected to be repaid over the next 36 months with the majority being repaid prior to the end of 2021.\nThe majority of our investments are made through sale-leaseback transactions in which we acquire the real estate from the owner-operators and then simultaneously lease the real estate back to them through long-term leases based on the tenant's business needs. The initial rental or capitalization rates we achieve on sale-leaseback transactions, calculated as the initial annualized base rent divided by the purchase price of the properties, vary from transaction to transaction based on many factors, such as the terms of the lease, the property type including the property's real estate fundamentals and the market rents in the area on the various types of properties we target across the United States. There are also online commercial real estate auction marketplaces for real estate transactions; properties acquired through these online marketplaces are often subject to existing leases and offered by third party sellers. In general, because we provide tailored customer lease solutions in sale-leaseback transactions, our lease rates historically have been higher and subject to less short-term market influences than what we have seen in the auction marketplace as a whole. In addition, since our real estate lease contracts are a substitute for both borrowings and equity that our customers would otherwise have to commit to their real estate locations, we believe there is a relationship between lease rates and market interest rates and that lease rates are also influenced by overall capital availability. The weighted average initial capitalization rate on the properties we acquired during 2020 and 2019 was approximately 8.1% and 7.8%, respectively. As we expected, by the end of 2020, capitalization rates had returned to near 2019 levels and we estimate that the lease rates will remain steady as we move into 2021.\nInterest Expense\nWe fund the growth in our real estate investment portfolio with excess cash flow from our operations after dividends and principal payments on debt, net proceeds from periodic sales of real estate, net proceeds from equity issuances and proceeds from issuances of long-term fixed-rate debt. We typically use our unsecured revolving credit facility to temporarily finance the properties we acquire.\nThe following table summarizes our interest expense.\nTable 96: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - credit facility fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - long-term debt (secured and unsecured)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 155,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 145,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (751)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,600)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on defeasance of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred financing costs and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 169,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 158,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit facility:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average debt outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 250,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 74,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average interest rate during the period (excluding facility fees)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (secured and unsecured):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average debt outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,639,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,310,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average interest rate during the period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increases in average outstanding long-term debt were the primary driver for the increases in interest expense on long-term debt. Long-term debt added during 2020 consisted of $350 million of 2.75% senior unsecured notes issued in November 2020. We used the proceeds from this issuance to prepay, without penalty, one of our $100 million bank term loans and STORE Master Funding Series 2015-1 Class A-1 notes aggregating $92.3 million at the time of prepayment; these notes were scheduled to mature in 2022 and bore an interest rate of 3.75%. As of December 31, 2020, we had $3.8 billion of long-term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 4.2%.\nInterest expense for 2019 included a $0.7 million loss incurred in connection with the defeasance of secured debt on a property pending disposition; we made a $7.4 million payment (including expenses) to defease the note payable, which had a remaining outstanding principal balance of $6.7 million. Interest expense for 2020 and 2019 included $0.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively, in accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs primarily related to STORE Master Funding prepayments.\nWe typically use our revolving credit facility on a short-term, temporary basis to acquire real estate properties until those borrowings are sufficiently large to warrant the economic issuance of long-term fixed-rate debt, the proceeds of which we generally use to pay down the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Interest expense associated with our revolving credit facility increased from 2019 to 2020 due to higher average outstanding borrowings offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate incurred on our borrowings due to decreases in one-month LIBOR. During 2020, the average one-month LIBOR was approximately 170 basis points lower than 2019. As noted earlier, as a precautionary measure due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, we borrowed $450 million under our revolving credit facility in March 2020 to increase liquidity and preserve financial flexibility and repaid this amount in full in August 2020. As a result of maintaining this additional liquidity for approximately five months, we incurred additional interest expense of approximately $3 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. The amount and timing of real estate acquisition activity and long-term debt and/or equity transactions will affect the level of borrowing activity on our credit facility.\nFrom time to time, we may fund construction of new properties for our customers and interest capitalized as a part of those activities represented approximately $0.8 million and $1.6 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nProperty Costs\nApproximately 99% of our leases are triple net, meaning that our tenants are generally responsible for the property-level operating costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance. Accordingly, we generally do not expect to incur property-level operating costs or capital expenditures, except during any period when one or more of our properties is no longer under lease or when our tenant is unable to meet their lease obligations. Our need to expend capital on our\nproperties is further reduced due to the fact that some of our tenants will periodically refresh the property at their own expense to meet their business needs or in connection with franchisor requirements. As of December 31, 2020, we owned nine properties that were vacant and not subject to a lease and the lease contracts related to just 13 owned properties are due to expire during 2021. We expect to incur some property costs related to the vacant properties until such time as those properties are either leased or sold. The amount of property costs can vary period to period based on the timing of property vacancies and the level of underperforming properties.\nWe experienced an increase in property costs during 2020, primarily related to additional accrued property taxes on tenant locations highly impacted by COVID-19, where the likelihood of STORE being required to make the property tax payment on behalf of the tenant is higher.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had entered into operating ground leases as part of several real estate investment transactions. The ground lease payments made by our tenants directly to the ground lessors are presented on a gross basis in the consolidated statement of income, both as rental revenues and as property costs. For the few lease contracts where we collect property taxes from our tenants and remit those taxes to governmental authorities, we reflect those payments on a gross basis as both rental revenue and as property costs.\nThe following is a summary of property costs (in thousands):\nTable 97: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property-level operating costs (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 16,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 5,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ground lease-related intangibles amortization expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating ground lease payments made by STORE Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating ground lease payments made by STORE Capital tenants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating ground lease straight-line rent expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property taxes payable from tenant impounds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total property costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 22,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 10,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td>(a) </td> <td>Property-level operating costs primarily include those expenses associated with vacant or nonperforming properties, property management costs for the few properties that have specific landlord obligations and the cost of performing property site inspections from time to time. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include compensation and benefits; professional fees such as portfolio servicing, legal, accounting and rating agency fees; and general office expenses such as insurance, office rent and travel costs. General and administrative costs totaled $49.7 million in 2020 as compared to $54.3 million in 2019. The decrease in expense in 2020 is primarily a result of the derecognition of $6.7 million of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense during the first quarter of 2020 related to certain performance-based restricted stock unit awards that were no longer expected to be earned, a decrease in commission expense due to the reduction in acquisition volume and a reduction in travel related costs as a result of restrictions on travel imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. This decrease was partially offset by increases due to the growth of our portfolio and related staff additions. Our employee base grew from 97 employees on December 31, 2019 to 106 employees as of December 31, 2020. Expenses for both years include approximately $2.0 million of executive severance costs. Certain expenses, such as property related insurance costs and the costs of servicing the properties and loans comprising our real estate portfolio, increase in direct proportion to the increase in the size of the portfolio. We expect that general and administrative expenses will continue to rise in some measure as our real estate investment portfolio grows; however, such expenses as a percentage of the portfolio have decreased over time due to efficiencies and economies of scale.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense, which increases in proportion to the increase in the size of our real estate portfolio, rose from $222.0 million in 2019 to $242.9 million in 2020.\nProvisions for Impairment\nDuring 2020, we recognized provisions for impairment aggregating $23.0 million; of this amount, $22.0 million represented provisions for the impairment of real estate and $1.0 million represented provisions for credit losses related to our loans and financing receivables. During 2019, we recognized provisions for impairment of real estate aggregating $18.8 million.\nNet Gain on Dispositions of Real Estate\nAs part of our ongoing active portfolio management process, we sell properties from time to time in order to enhance the diversity and quality of our real estate portfolio and to take advantage of opportunities to recycle capital. During 2020, we recognized a $22.8 million aggregate net gain on the sale of 77 properties. In comparison, during 2019, we recognized an $84.1 million aggregate net gain on the sale of 95 properties and a $3.9 million non-cash gain resulting from the substitution of ten properties with a single tenant. The net proceeds from the dispositions of real estate during 2020 aggregated $215 million as compared to an aggregate original investment amount of $236 million. For properties sold during 2019, net proceeds aggregated $448 million as compared to an aggregate original investment amount of $429 million. As noted earlier, during 2020 and 2019, we also collected $0.6 million and $4.1 million, respectively, of early lease termination payments in connection with certain property sales.\nNet Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our net income was $212.6 million reflecting a decrease from $285.0 million in 2019. The change in net income is primarily the result of lower aggregate net gains on dispositions of real estate.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nOur reported results are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. We also disclose Funds from Operations, or FFO, and Adjusted Funds from Operations, or AFFO, both of which are non-GAAP measures. We believe these two non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs. FFO and AFFO do not represent cash generated from operating activities and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements; accordingly, they should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or to cash flows from operations as reported on a statement of cash flows as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.\nWe compute FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income, excluding gains (or losses) from extraordinary items and sales of depreciable property, real estate impairment losses, and depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries.\nTo derive AFFO, we modify the NAREIT computation of FFO to include other adjustments to GAAP net income related to certain revenues and expenses that have no impact on our long-term operating performance, such as straight-line rents, amortization of deferred financing costs and stock-based compensation. In addition, in deriving AFFO, we exclude certain other costs not related to our ongoing operations, such as the amortization of lease-related intangibles.\nFFO is used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains (or losses) on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. Management believes that AFFO provides more useful information to investors and analysts because it modifies FFO to exclude certain additional revenues and expenses such as straight-line rents, including construction period rent deferrals, and the amortization of deferred financing costs, stock-based compensation and lease-related intangibles as such items have no impact on long-term operating performance. As a result, we believe AFFO to be a more meaningful measurement of ongoing performance that allows for greater performance comparability. Therefore, we disclose both FFO and AFFO and\nreconcile them to the most appropriate GAAP performance metric, which is net income. STORE Capital's FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income (which we believe is the most comparable GAAP measure) to FFO and AFFO.\nTable 99: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 212,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 284,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 216,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 242,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 221,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 180,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for impairment of real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on dispositions of real estate (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,774)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (84,142)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45,398)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from Operations (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 454,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 441,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 357,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Straight-line rental revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rent escalations accrued\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,087)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,021)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,121)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction period rent deferrals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred financing costs and other (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease-related intangibles and costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease termination fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (602)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,096)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (751)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,600)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,641)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Income) loss from non-real estate, equity method investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,500)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Executive severance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss (gain) on defeasance/extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (814)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Funds from Operations (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 462,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 458,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 377,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td>(a) </td> <td>For the year ended December 31, 2018, includes $130,000 of income tax expense associated with gains recognized on the dispositions of certain properties. </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td>(b) </td> <td>FFO and AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2020, include approximately $57.1 million of net revenue that is subject to the short-term deferral arrangements entered into in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and Business\u201d sections, as well as the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the Forward-Looking Statements\u201d sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe were formed in 2011 to invest in and manage Single Tenant Operational Real Estate, or STORE Property, which is our target market and the inspiration for our name. A STORE Property is a property location at which a company operates its business and generates sales and profits, which makes the location a profit center and, therefore, fundamentally important to that business. Due to the long-term nature of our leases, we focus our acquisition activity on properties that operate in industries we believe have long-term relevance, the majority of which are service industries. Our customers operate their businesses under a wide range of brand names or business concepts. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 760 brand names or business concepts in over 100 industries were represented in our investment portfolio. By acquiring the real estate from the operators and then leasing the real estate back to them, the operators become our long-term tenants, and we refer to them as our customers. Through the execution of these sale-leaseback transactions, we fill a need for our customers by providing them a source of long-term capital that enables them to avoid the need to incur debt and/or employ equity in order to finance the real estate that is essential to their business.\nWe are a Maryland corporation organized as an internally managed real estate investment trust, or REIT. As a REIT, we will generally not be subject to federal income tax to the extent that we distribute all of our taxable income to our stockholders and meet other requirements.\nOur shares of common stock have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since our initial public offering, or IPO, in November 2014 and trade under the ticker symbol STOR.\u201d\nSince our inception in 2011, we have selectively originated over $11.1 billion of real estate investments. As of December 31, 2020, our investment portfolio totaled approximately $9.6 billion, consisting of investments in 2,634 property locations across the United States. All of the real estate we acquire is held by our wholly owned subsidiaries, many of which are special purpose bankruptcy remote entities formed to facilitate the financing of our real estate. We predominantly acquire our single-tenant properties directly from our customers in sale-leaseback transactions where our customers sell us their operating properties and then simultaneously enter into long-term triple-net leases with us to lease the properties back. Accordingly, our properties are fully occupied and under lease from the moment we acquire them.\nWe generate our cash from operations primarily through the monthly lease payments, or base rent\u201d, we receive from our customers under their long-term leases with us. We also receive interest payments on loans receivable, which are a small part of our portfolio. We refer to the monthly scheduled lease and interest payments due from our customers as base rent and interest\u201d. Most of our leases contain lease escalations every year or every several years that are based on the lesser of the increase in the Consumer Price Index or a stated percentage (if such contracts are expressed on an annual basis, currently averaging approximately 1.9%), which allows the monthly lease payments we receive to increase somewhat in an inflationary economic environment. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 99% of our leases (based on base rent) were triple-net\u201d leases, which means that our customers are responsible for all of the operating costs such as maintenance, insurance and property taxes associated with the properties they lease from us, including any increases in those costs that may occur as a result of inflation. The remaining leases have some landlord responsibilities, generally related to maintenance and structural component replacement that may be required on such properties in the future, although we do not currently anticipate incurring significant capital expenditures or property-level operating costs under such leases. Because our properties are single-tenant properties, almost all of which are under long-term leases, it is not necessary for us to perform any significant ongoing leasing activities on our properties. As of December 31, 2020, the\nweighted average remaining term of our leases (calculated based on base rent) was approximately 14 years, excluding renewal options, which are exercisable at the option of our tenants upon expiration of their base lease term. Leases approximating 99% of our base rent as of that date provide for tenant renewal options (generally two to four five-year options) and leases approximating 11% of our base rent provide our tenants the option, at their election, to purchase the property from us at a specified time or times (generally at the greater of the then-fair market value or our cost, as defined in the lease contracts).\nWe have dedicated an internal team to review and analyze ongoing tenant financial performance, both at the corporate level and at each property we own, in order to identify properties that may no longer be part of our long-term strategic plan. As part of that continuous active-management process, we may decide to sell properties where we believe the property no longer fits within our plan. Because generally we have been able to acquire assets and originate new leases at lease rates above the online commercial real estate auction marketplace, we have been able to sell these assets on both opportunistic and strategic bases, typically for a gain. This gain acts to partially offset any possible losses we may experience in the real estate portfolio.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nDuring 2020 and continuing into 2021, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has primarily impacted us through government mandated limits (i.e., required closing or limits on operations and social distancing requirements) imposed on our tenants' businesses and continuing public perceptions regarding safety, which impacted our tenants' ability to pay their rent to us. We took a number of mitigation steps in response to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. We were able to immediately transition to a remote working environment and our 106 employees have collectively taken steps to manage the impact to us, carrying on daily operations remotely. We communicated most frequently through video conferencing software, both internally and with external parties, which has been an essential tool to maintain an important team environment. In order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of the uncertainties in the markets at the onset of the pandemic, we borrowed an additional $450 million on our unsecured revolving credit facility in March 2020. We repaid this amount in full in August 2020 and, as of December 31, 2020, we had no amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nTo assist our tenants during the pandemic, we worked directly with our tenants to help them continue to meet their rent payment obligations to us, including providing short-term rent deferral arrangements. These arrangements included a structured rent relief program through which we allowed tenants that were highly and adversely impacted by the pandemic to defer the payment of their rent on a short-term basis. Rent relief repayment is primarily structured through short-term, interest-bearing notes. Through December 31, 2020, we have recognized net revenue aggregating approximately $57.1 million related to these deferral arrangements and collected $9.9 million in repayments of the amounts deferred. The remaining receivables are expected to be repaid over the next 36 months with the majority being repaid prior to the end of 2021.\nCurrently, most states have lifted the most onerous restrictions that have significantly impacted economic activity; however, the economic impact of COVID-19 is expected to continue over the near term and may continue throughout 2021, depending on state and local outbreaks and the availability and acceptance of effective vaccines. As restrictions are lifted, our tenants have gradually increased their business activity and, therefore, have improved their ability to meet their financial obligations to us under their lease contracts. As a result, our rent and interest collections have increased from 70% in May 2020 to 93% in February 2021. Further, nearly all of our properties have reopened for business with movie theaters remaining as the industry most impacted by social distancing measures.\nAlthough 99% of our leases are triple net, meaning that our tenants are generally responsible for the property-level operating costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance, we may be required make the property tax payment on behalf of the tenant if they are unable to do so. We experienced an increase in property costs during 2020, primarily related to property taxes on tenant locations where we expect the tenant may not be able to pay them when due.\nThe Company continues to closely monitor unpredictable factors that could impact its business going forward, including the duration of the pandemic; governmental, business and individual actions in response to the pandemic, including the vaccination process; and the overall impact on broad economic activity.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, our investment portfolio stood at approximately $9.6 billion, consisting of investments in 2,634 property locations. Substantially all of our cash from operations is generated by our investment portfolio.\nOur primary cash expenditures are the principal and interest payments we make on the debt we use to finance our real estate investment portfolio and the general and administrative expenses of managing the portfolio and operating our business. Since substantially all of our leases are triple net, our tenants are generally responsible for the maintenance, insurance and property taxes associated with the properties they lease from us. When a property becomes vacant through a tenant default or expiration of the lease term with no tenant renewal, we incur the property costs not paid by the tenant, as well as those property costs accruing during the time it takes to locate a substitute tenant or sell the property. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted average remaining term of our leases was approximately 14 years and the lease contracts related to just 13 of our properties, representing less than 0.1% of our annual base rent and interest, are due to expire during 2021; 79% of our leases have ten years or more remaining in their base lease term. As of December 31, 2020, nine of our 2,634 properties were vacant and not subject to a lease, which represents a 99.7% occupancy rate. We expect to incur some property-level operating costs from time to time in periods during which properties that become vacant are being remarketed. In addition, we may recognize an expense for certain property costs, such as real estate taxes billed in arrears, if we believe the tenant is likely to vacate the property before making payment on those obligations or be able to pay such costs in a timely manner. Property costs are generally not significant to our operations, but the amount of property costs can vary quarter to quarter based on the timing of property vacancies and the level of underperforming properties. During 2020, we experienced an increase in property costs, primarily related to tenants highly impacted by COVID-19, where the likelihood of STORE being required to make a property tax payment on behalf of the tenant was higher. Increased property costs may continue for some portion of 2021 due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic. Absent the pandemic, we may advance certain property costs on behalf of our tenants but expect that the majority of these costs will be reimbursed by the tenant and do not anticipate that they will be significant to our operations.\nIn order to preserve financial flexibility during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, we fully drew down our credit facility (which we subsequently repaid in August 2020) and temporarily reduced our new property acquisition activity. As we continue to gain better visibility into the path to recovery from the pandemic, we intend to continue to grow through additional real estate investments. To accomplish this objective, we must continue to identify real estate acquisitions that are consistent with our underwriting guidelines and raise future additional capital to make such acquisitions. We acquire real estate with a combination of debt and equity capital, proceeds from the sale of properties and cash from operations that is not otherwise distributed to our stockholders in the form of dividends. When we sell properties, we generally reinvest the cash proceeds from those sales in new property acquisitions. We also periodically commit to fund the construction of new properties for our customers or to provide them funds to improve and/or renovate properties we lease to them. These additional investments will generally result in increases to the rental revenue or interest income due under the related contracts. As of December 31, 2020, we had commitments to our customers to fund improvements to owned or mortgaged real estate properties totaling approximately $119.1 million, the majority of which is expected to be funded in the next twelve months.\nFinancing Strategy\nOur debt capital is initially provided on a short-term, temporary basis through a multi-year, variable-rate unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks. We manage our long-term leverage position through the strategic and economic issuance of long-term fixed-rate debt on both a secured and unsecured basis. By matching the expected cash inflows from our long-term real estate leases with the expected cash outflows of our long-term fixed-rate debt, we lock in\u201d, for as long as is economically feasible, the expected positive difference between our scheduled cash inflows on the leases and the cash outflows on our debt payments. By locking in this difference, or spread, we seek to reduce the risk that increases in interest rates would adversely impact our profitability. In addition, we may use various financial instruments designed to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies such as interest rate swaps and caps, depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. We also ladder our debt maturities in order to minimize the gap between our free cash flow (which we define as our cash from operations less dividends plus proceeds from our sale of properties) and our annual debt maturities; we have no significant debt maturities through 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2020, all our long-term debt was fixed-rate debt or was effectively converted to a fixed-rate for the term of the debt and our weighted average debt maturity was 6.6 years. As part of our long-term debt strategy, we develop and maintain broad access to multiple debt sources. We believe that having access to multiple debt markets increases our financing flexibility because different debt markets may attract different kinds of investors, thus expanding our access to a larger pool of potential debt investors. Also, a particular debt market may be more competitive than another at any particular point in time.\nThe long-term debt we have issued to date is comprised of both secured non-recourse borrowings, the vast majority of which is investment-grade rated, and senior investment-grade unsecured borrowings. We are currently rated Baa2 , BBB and BBB by Moody's Investors Service, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, respectively. In conjunction with our investment-grade debt strategy, we target a level of debt net of cash and cash equivalents that approximates 5\u00bd to 6 times our estimated annualized amount of earnings (excluding gains or losses on sales of real estate and provisions for impairment) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (based on our current investment portfolio).\nOur secured non-recourse borrowings are obtained through multiple debt markets - primarily the asset-backed securities debt market. The vast majority of our secured non-recourse borrowings were made through an investment-grade-rated debt program we designed, which we call our Master Funding debt program. By design, this program provides flexibility not commonly found in most secured non-recourse debt and which is described in Non-recourse Secured Debt below. To a lesser extent, we may also obtain fixed-rate non-recourse mortgage financing through the commercial mortgage-backed securities debt market or from banks and insurance companies secured by specific properties we pledge as collateral.\nOur goal is to employ a prudent blend of secured non-recourse debt through our flexible Master Funding debt program, paired with senior unsecured debt that uses our investment grade credit ratings. By balancing the mix of secured and unsecured debt, we can effectively leverage those properties subject to the secured debt in the range of 60%-70% and, at the same time, target a more conservative level of overall corporate leverage by maintaining a large pool of properties that are unencumbered. As of December 31, 2020, our secured non-recourse borrowings had a weighted average loan-to-cost ratio of approximately 64% and approximately 37% of our investment portfolio serves as collateral for this long-term debt. The remaining 63% of our portfolio properties, aggregating approximately $6.1 billion at December 31, 2020, are unencumbered and this unencumbered pool of properties provides us the flexibility to access long-term unsecured borrowings. The result is that our growing unencumbered pool of properties can provide higher levels of debt service coverage on the senior unsecured debt than would be the case if we employed only unsecured debt at our overall corporate leverage level. We believe this debt strategy can lead to a lower cost of capital for the Company, especially as we can issue AAA rated debt from our Master Funding debt program, as described further below.\nThe availability of debt to finance commercial real estate in the United States can, at times, be impacted by economic and other factors that are beyond our control. An example of adverse economic factors occurred during the recession of 2007 to 2009 when availability of debt capital for commercial real estate was significantly curtailed. We seek to reduce the risk that long-term debt capital may be unavailable to us by maintaining the flexibility to issue long-term debt in multiple debt capital markets, both secured and unsecured, and by limiting the period between the time we acquire our real estate and the time we finance our real estate with long-term debt. In addition, we have arranged our unsecured revolving credit facility to have a multi-year term with extension options in order to reduce the risk that short-term real estate financing would not be available to us. As we grow our real estate portfolio, we also intend to manage our debt maturities to reduce the risk that a significant amount of our debt will mature in any single year in the future. Because our long-term secured debt generally requires monthly payments of principal, in addition to the monthly interest payments, the resulting principal amortization also reduces our refinancing risk upon maturity of the debt. As our outstanding debt matures, we may refinance the maturing debt as it comes due or choose to repay it using cash and cash equivalents or our unsecured revolving credit facility. For example, as part of the STORE Master Funding Series 2018-1 notes issuance in October 2018, we prepaid, without penalty, an aggregate of $233.3 million of STORE Master Funding Series 2013-1 and Series 2013-2 Class A-1 notes that were scheduled to mature in 2020. Also, as part of the STORE Master Funding Series 2019-1 notes issuance in November 2019, we prepaid, without penalty, an aggregate of $186.1 million of STORE Master Funding Series 2013-3 and Series 2014-1 Class A-1 notes. In addition, as part of our third issuance of senior unsecured public notes in November 2020, we prepaid, without penalty, $92.3 million of STORE Master Funding Series 2015-1 Class A-1 notes and one of our $100 million bank term loans. Similar to the STORE Master Funding prepayments\ndescribed above, we may prepay other existing long-term debt in circumstances where we believe it would be economically advantageous to do so.\nUnsecured Revolving Credit Facility\nTypically, we use our $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility to acquire our real estate properties, until those borrowings are sufficiently large to warrant the economic issuance of long-term fixed-rate debt, the proceeds from which we use to repay the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we borrowed an additional $450 million on our unsecured revolving credit facility in March 2020 to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of the uncertainties in the markets at that time; we repaid this amount in full in August 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had no amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nOur unsecured revolving credit facility also has an accordion feature of $800 million, which gives us a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.4 billion. The facility matures in February 2022 and includes two six-month extension options, subject to certain conditions. Borrowings under the facility require monthly payments of interest at a rate selected by us of either (1) LIBOR plus a credit spread ranging from 0.825% to 1.55%, or (2) the Base Rate, as defined in the credit agreement, plus a credit spread ranging from 0.00% to 0.55%. The credit spread used is based on our credit rating as defined in the credit agreement. We are also required to pay a facility fee on the total commitment amount ranging from 0.125% to 0.30%. The currently applicable credit spread for LIBOR-based borrowings is 1.00% and the facility fee is 0.20%.\nUnder the terms of the facility, we are subject to various restrictive financial and nonfinancial covenants which, among other things, require us to maintain certain leverage ratios, cash flow and debt service coverage ratios, secured borrowing ratios and a minimum level of tangible net worth. Certain of these ratios are based on our pool of unencumbered assets, which aggregated approximately $6.1 billion at December 31, 2020. The facility is recourse to us and, as of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the financial and nonfinancial covenants under the facility and do not anticipate any compliance issues in the foreseeable future.\nSenior Unsecured Term Debt\nIn November 2020, we completed our third issuance of underwritten public notes in an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million and, as of December 31, 2020, we had an aggregate principal amount of $1.05 billion of underwritten public notes outstanding. These senior unsecured notes bear a weighted average coupon rate of 3.96% and interest on these notes is paid semi-annually in March and September or May and November of each year. The supplemental indentures governing our public notes contain various restrictive covenants, including limitations on our ability to incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with these covenants and expect to remain in compliance in the foreseeable future. Prior to our inaugural issuance of public debt in March 2018, our unsecured long-term debt had been issued through the private placement of notes to institutional investors and through groups of lenders who also participate in our unsecured revolving credit facility; the financial covenants of the privately placed notes and the remaining bank term loan are similar to our unsecured revolving credit facility. The aggregate outstanding principal amount of our unsecured senior notes and term loans payable was $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nNon-recourse Secured Debt\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 33% of our real estate investment portfolio served as collateral for outstanding borrowings under our STORE Master Funding debt program. We believe our STORE Master Funding program allows for flexibility not commonly found in non-recourse debt, often making it preferable to traditional debt issued in the commercial mortgage-backed securities market. Under the program, STORE serves as both master and special servicer for the collateral pool, allowing for active portfolio monitoring and prompt issue resolution. In addition, features of the program allowing for the sale or substitution of collateral, provided certain criteria are met, facilitate active portfolio management. Through this debt program, we arrange for bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity subsidiaries to issue multiple series of investment-grade asset-backed net-lease mortgage notes, or ABS notes, from time to time as\nadditional collateral is added to the collateral pool and leverage can be added in incremental note issuances based on the value of the collateral pool.\nThe ABS notes are generally issued by our wholly owned special purpose entity subsidiaries to institutional investors through the asset-backed securities market. These ABS notes are typically issued in two classes, Class A and Class B. At the time of issuance, the Class A notes represent approximately 70% of the appraised value of the underlying real estate collateral owned by the issuing subsidiaries and are currently rated AAA or A+ by S&P Global Ratings. The Series 2018-1 transaction in October 2018 marked our inaugural issuance of AAA rated notes and we believe it broadens the market for our STORE Master Funding debt program and gives us access to lower cost secured debt. In November 2019, our consolidated special purpose entities issued the ninth series, Series 2019-1, representing $508 million of net-lease mortgage notes under the STORE Master Funding debt program.\nThe Series 2019-1 transaction marked our inaugural issuance of 15-year notes, included $326 million of AAA rated notes and served to solidify our belief that the market for the STORE Master Funding program is broadening. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Class A notes were primarily used to pay down outstanding balances on our credit facility and to prepay, without penalty, STORE Master Funding Series 2013-3 and Series 2014-1 Class A-1 notes aggregating approximately $186.1 million at the time of prepayment; these notes were scheduled to mature in 2020 and 2021 and bore a weighted average interest rate of 4.2%.\nThe Class B notes, which are subordinated to the Class A notes as to principal repayment, represent approximately 5% of the appraised value of the underlying real estate collateral and are currently rated BBB by S&P Global Ratings. As of December 31, 2020, there was an aggregate $155.0 million in principal amount of Class B notes outstanding. We have historically retained these Class B notes and they are held by one of our bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity subsidiaries. The Class B notes are not reflected in our financial statements because they eliminate in consolidation. Since the Class B notes are considered issued and outstanding, they provide us with additional financial flexibility in that we may sell them to a third party in the future or use them as collateral for short-term borrowings as we have done from time to time in the past.\nThe ABS notes outstanding at December 31, 2020 totaled $2.0 billion in Class A principal amount and were supported by a collateral pool of approximately $3.2 billion representing 1,121 property locations operated by 207 customers. The amount of debt that can be issued in any new series is determined by the structure of the transaction and the aggregate amount of collateral in the pool at the time of issuance. In addition, the issuance of each new series of notes is subject to the satisfaction of several conditions, including that there is no event of default on the existing note series and that the issuance will not result in an event of default on, or the credit rating downgrade of, the existing note series.\nA significant portion of our cash flow is generated by the special purpose entities comprising our STORE Master Funding debt program. For the year ended December 31, 2020, excess cash flow, after payment of debt service and servicing and trustee expenses, totaled $94 million on cash collections of $233 million, which represents an overall ratio of cash collections to debt service, or debt service coverage ratio (as defined in the program documents), of nearly 1.7 to 1 on the STORE Master Funding program. For purposes of this debt service coverage ratio calculation, cash collections include the rent paid by tenants using the cash proceeds from short-term notes provided by a STORE Capital subsidiary in connection with the short-term rent deferral arrangements structured as part of our COVID-19 rent relief efforts. If at any time the debt service coverage ratio generated by the collateral pool is less than 1.3 to 1, excess cash flow from the STORE Master Funding entities will be deposited into a reserve account to be used for payments to be made on the net lease mortgage notes, to the extent there is a shortfall. We currently expect to remain above program minimum debt service coverage ratios for the foreseeable future.\nTo a lesser extent, we also may obtain debt in discrete transactions through other bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity subsidiaries, which debt is solely secured by specific real estate assets and is generally non-recourse to us (subject to certain customary limited exceptions). These discrete borrowings are generally in the form of traditional mortgage notes payable, with principal and interest payments due monthly and balloon payments due at their respective maturity dates, which typically range from seven to ten years from the date of issuance. Our secured borrowings contain various covenants customarily found in mortgage notes, including a limitation on the issuing entity's ability to incur\nadditional indebtedness on the underlying real estate. Certain of the notes also require the posting of cash reserves with the lender or trustee if specified coverage ratios are not maintained by the special purpose entity or the tenant.\nDebt Summary\nAs of December 31, 2020, our aggregate secured and unsecured long-term debt had an outstanding principal balance of $3.8 billion, a weighted average maturity of 6.6 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.2%. The following is a summary of the outstanding balance of our borrowings as well as a summary of the", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and Business\u201d sections, as well as the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the Forward-Looking Statements\u201d sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe were formed in 2011 to invest in and manage Single Tenant Operational Real Estate, or STORE Property, which is our target market and the inspiration for our name. A STORE Property is a property location at which a company operates its business and generates sales and profits, which makes the location a profit center and, therefore, fundamentally important to that business. Due to the long-term nature of our leases, we focus our acquisition activity on properties that operate in industries we believe have long-term relevance, the majority of which are service industries. Our customers operate their businesses under a wide range of brand names or business concepts. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 760 brand names or business concepts in over 100 industries were represented in our investment portfolio. By acquiring the real estate from the operators and then leasing the real estate back to them, the operators become our long-term tenants, and we refer to them as our customers. Through the execution of these sale-leaseback transactions, we fill a need for our customers by providing them a source of long-term capital that enables them to avoid the need to incur debt and/or employ equity in order to finance the real estate that is essential to their business.\nWe are a Maryland corporation organized as an internally managed real estate investment trust, or REIT. As a REIT, we will generally not be subject to federal income tax to the extent that we distribute all of our taxable income to our stockholders and meet other requirements.\nOur shares of common stock have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since our initial public offering, or IPO, in November 2014 and trade under the ticker symbol STOR.\u201d\nSince our inception in 2011, we have selectively originated over $11.1 billion of real estate investments. As of December 31, 2020, our investment portfolio totaled approximately $9.6 billion, consisting of investments in 2,634 property locations across the United States. All of the real estate we acquire is held by our wholly owned subsidiaries, many of which are special purpose bankruptcy remote entities formed to facilitate the financing of our real estate. We predominantly acquire our single-tenant properties directly from our customers in sale-leaseback transactions where our customers sell us their operating properties and then simultaneously enter into long-term triple-net leases with us to lease the properties back. Accordingly, our properties are fully occupied and under lease from the moment we acquire them.\nWe generate our cash from operations primarily through the monthly lease payments, or base rent\u201d, we receive from our customers under their long-term leases with us. We also receive interest payments on loans receivable, which are a small part of our portfolio. We refer to the monthly scheduled lease and interest payments due from our customers as base rent and interest\u201d. Most of our leases contain lease escalations every year or every several years that are based on the lesser of the increase in the Consumer Price Index or a stated percentage (if such contracts are expressed on an annual basis, currently averaging approximately 1.9%), which allows the monthly lease payments we receive to increase somewhat in an inflationary economic environment. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 99% of our leases (based on base rent) were triple-net\u201d leases, which means that our customers are responsible for all of the operating costs such as maintenance, insurance and property taxes associated with the properties they lease from us, including any increases in those costs that may occur as a result of inflation. The remaining leases have some landlord responsibilities, generally related to maintenance and structural component replacement that may be required on such properties in the future, although we do not currently anticipate incurring significant capital expenditures or property-level operating costs under such leases. Because our properties are single-tenant properties, almost all of which are under long-term leases, it is not necessary for us to perform any significant ongoing leasing activities on our properties. As of December 31, 2020, the\nweighted average remaining term of our leases (calculated based on base rent) was approximately 14 years, excluding renewal options, which are exercisable at the option of our tenants upon expiration of their base lease term. Leases approximating 99% of our base rent as of that date provide for tenant renewal options (generally two to four five-year options) and leases approximating 11% of our base rent provide our tenants the option, at their election, to purchase the property from us at a specified time or times (generally at the greater of the then-fair market value or our cost, as defined in the lease contracts).\nWe have dedicated an internal team to review and analyze ongoing tenant financial performance, both at the corporate level and at each property we own, in order to identify properties that may no longer be part of our long-term strategic plan. As part of that continuous active-management process, we may decide to sell properties where we believe the property no longer fits within our plan. Because generally we have been able to acquire assets and originate new leases at lease rates above the online commercial real estate auction marketplace, we have been able to sell these assets on both opportunistic and strategic bases, typically for a gain. This gain acts to partially offset any possible losses we may experience in the real estate portfolio.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nDuring 2020 and continuing into 2021, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has primarily impacted us through government mandated limits (i.e., required closing or limits on operations and social distancing requirements) imposed on our tenants' businesses and continuing public perceptions regarding safety, which impacted our tenants' ability to pay their rent to us. We took a number of mitigation steps in response to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. We were able to immediately transition to a remote working environment and our 106 employees have collectively taken steps to manage the impact to us, carrying on daily operations remotely. We communicated most frequently through video conferencing software, both internally and with external parties, which has been an essential tool to maintain an important team environment. In order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of the uncertainties in the markets at the onset of the pandemic, we borrowed an additional $450 million on our unsecured revolving credit facility in March 2020. We repaid this amount in full in August 2020 and, as of December 31, 2020, we had no amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nTo assist our tenants during the pandemic, we worked directly with our tenants to help them continue to meet their rent payment obligations to us, including providing short-term rent deferral arrangements. These arrangements included a structured rent relief program through which we allowed tenants that were highly and adversely impacted by the pandemic to defer the payment of their rent on a short-term basis. Rent relief repayment is primarily structured through short-term, interest-bearing notes. Through December 31, 2020, we have recognized net revenue aggregating approximately $57.1 million related to these deferral arrangements and collected $9.9 million in repayments of the amounts deferred. The remaining receivables are expected to be repaid over the next 36 months with the majority being repaid prior to the end of 2021.\nCurrently, most states have lifted the most onerous restrictions that have significantly impacted economic activity; however, the economic impact of COVID-19 is expected to continue over the near term and may continue throughout 2021, depending on state and local outbreaks and the availability and acceptance of effective vaccines. As restrictions are lifted, our tenants have gradually increased their business activity and, therefore, have improved their ability to meet their financial obligations to us under their lease contracts. As a result, our rent and interest collections have increased from 70% in May 2020 to 93% in February 2021. Further, nearly all of our properties have reopened for business with movie theaters remaining as the industry most impacted by social distancing measures.\nAlthough 99% of our leases are triple net, meaning that our tenants are generally responsible for the property-level operating costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance, we may be required make the property tax payment on behalf of the tenant if they are unable to do so. We experienced an increase in property costs during 2020, primarily related to property taxes on tenant locations where we expect the tenant may not be able to pay them when due.\nThe Company continues to closely monitor unpredictable factors that could impact its business going forward, including the duration of the pandemic; governmental, business and individual actions in response to the pandemic, including the vaccination process; and the overall impact on broad economic activity.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, our investment portfolio stood at approximately $9.6 billion, consisting of investments in 2,634 property locations. Substantially all of our cash from operations is generated by our investment portfolio.\nOur primary cash expenditures are the principal and interest payments we make on the debt we use to finance our real estate investment portfolio and the general and administrative expenses of managing the portfolio and operating our business. Since substantially all of our leases are triple net, our tenants are generally responsible for the maintenance, insurance and property taxes associated with the properties they lease from us. When a property becomes vacant through a tenant default or expiration of the lease term with no tenant renewal, we incur the property costs not paid by the tenant, as well as those property costs accruing during the time it takes to locate a substitute tenant or sell the property. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted average remaining term of our leases was approximately 14 years and the lease contracts related to just 13 of our properties, representing less than 0.1% of our annual base rent and interest, are due to expire during 2021; 79% of our leases have ten years or more remaining in their base lease term. As of December 31, 2020, nine of our 2,634 properties were vacant and not subject to a lease, which represents a 99.7% occupancy rate. We expect to incur some property-level operating costs from time to time in periods during which properties that become vacant are being remarketed. In addition, we may recognize an expense for certain property costs, such as real estate taxes billed in arrears, if we believe the tenant is likely to vacate the property before making payment on those obligations or be able to pay such costs in a timely manner. Property costs are generally not significant to our operations, but the amount of property costs can vary quarter to quarter based on the timing of property vacancies and the level of underperforming properties. During 2020, we experienced an increase in property costs, primarily related to tenants highly impacted by COVID-19, where the likelihood of STORE being required to make a property tax payment on behalf of the tenant was higher. Increased property costs may continue for some portion of 2021 due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic. Absent the pandemic, we may advance certain property costs on behalf of our tenants but expect that the majority of these costs will be reimbursed by the tenant and do not anticipate that they will be significant to our operations.\nIn order to preserve financial flexibility during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, we fully drew down our credit facility (which we subsequently repaid in August 2020) and temporarily reduced our new property acquisition activity. As we continue to gain better visibility into the path to recovery from the pandemic, we intend to continue to grow through additional real estate investments. To accomplish this objective, we must continue to identify real estate acquisitions that are consistent with our underwriting guidelines and raise future additional capital to make such acquisitions. We acquire real estate with a combination of debt and equity capital, proceeds from the sale of properties and cash from operations that is not otherwise distributed to our stockholders in the form of dividends. When we sell properties, we generally reinvest the cash proceeds from those sales in new property acquisitions. We also periodically commit to fund the construction of new properties for our customers or to provide them funds to improve and/or renovate properties we lease to them. These additional investments will generally result in increases to the rental revenue or interest income due under the related contracts. As of December 31, 2020, we had commitments to our customers to fund improvements to owned or mortgaged real estate properties totaling approximately $119.1 million, the majority of which is expected to be funded in the next twelve months.\nFinancing Strategy\nOur debt capital is initially provided on a short-term, temporary basis through a multi-year, variable-rate unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks. We manage our long-term leverage position through the strategic and economic issuance of long-term fixed-rate debt on both a secured and unsecured basis. By matching the expected cash inflows from our long-term real estate leases with the expected cash outflows of our long-term fixed-rate debt, we lock in\u201d, for as long as is economically feasible, the expected positive difference between our scheduled cash inflows on the leases and the cash outflows on our debt payments. By locking in this difference, or spread, we seek to reduce the risk that increases in interest rates would adversely impact our profitability. In addition, we may use various financial instruments designed to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies such as interest rate swaps and caps, depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. We also ladder our debt maturities in order to minimize the gap between our free cash flow (which we define as our cash from operations less dividends plus proceeds from our sale of properties) and our annual debt maturities; we have no significant debt maturities through 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2020, all our long-term debt was fixed-rate debt or was effectively converted to a fixed-rate for the term of the debt and our weighted average debt maturity was 6.6 years. As part of our long-term debt strategy, we develop and maintain broad access to multiple debt sources. We believe that having access to multiple debt markets increases our financing flexibility because different debt markets may attract different kinds of investors, thus expanding our access to a larger pool of potential debt investors. Also, a particular debt market may be more competitive than another at any particular point in time.\nThe long-term debt we have issued to date is comprised of both secured non-recourse borrowings, the vast majority of which is investment-grade rated, and senior investment-grade unsecured borrowings. We are currently rated Baa2 , BBB and BBB by Moody's Investors Service, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, respectively. In conjunction with our investment-grade debt strategy, we target a level of debt net of cash and cash equivalents that approximates 5\u00bd to 6 times our estimated annualized amount of earnings (excluding gains or losses on sales of real estate and provisions for impairment) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (based on our current investment portfolio).\nOur secured non-recourse borrowings are obtained through multiple debt markets - primarily the asset-backed securities debt market. The vast majority of our secured non-recourse borrowings were made through an investment-grade-rated debt program we designed, which we call our Master Funding debt program. By design, this program provides flexibility not commonly found in most secured non-recourse debt and which is described in Non-recourse Secured Debt below. To a lesser extent, we may also obtain fixed-rate non-recourse mortgage financing through the commercial mortgage-backed securities debt market or from banks and insurance companies secured by specific properties we pledge as collateral.\nOur goal is to employ a prudent blend of secured non-recourse debt through our flexible Master Funding debt program, paired with senior unsecured debt that uses our investment grade credit ratings. By balancing the mix of secured and unsecured debt, we can effectively leverage those properties subject to the secured debt in the range of 60%-70% and, at the same time, target a more conservative level of overall corporate leverage by maintaining a large pool of properties that are unencumbered. As of December 31, 2020, our secured non-recourse borrowings had a weighted average loan-to-cost ratio of approximately 64% and approximately 37% of our investment portfolio serves as collateral for this long-term debt. The remaining 63% of our portfolio properties, aggregating approximately $6.1 billion at December 31, 2020, are unencumbered and this unencumbered pool of properties provides us the flexibility to access long-term unsecured borrowings. The result is that our growing unencumbered pool of properties can provide higher levels of debt service coverage on the senior unsecured debt than would be the case if we employed only unsecured debt at our overall corporate leverage level. We believe this debt strategy can lead to a lower cost of capital for the Company, especially as we can issue AAA rated debt from our Master Funding debt program, as described further below.\nThe availability of debt to finance commercial real estate in the United States can, at times, be impacted by economic and other factors that are beyond our control. An example of adverse economic factors occurred during the recession of 2007 to 2009 when availability of debt capital for commercial real estate was significantly curtailed. We seek to reduce the risk that long-term debt capital may be unavailable to us by maintaining the flexibility to issue long-term debt in multiple debt capital markets, both secured and unsecured, and by limiting the period between the time we acquire our real estate and the time we finance our real estate with long-term debt. In addition, we have arranged our unsecured revolving credit facility to have a multi-year term with extension options in order to reduce the risk that short-term real estate financing would not be available to us. As we grow our real estate portfolio, we also intend to manage our debt maturities to reduce the risk that a significant amount of our debt will mature in any single year in the future. Because our long-term secured debt generally requires monthly payments of principal, in addition to the monthly interest payments, the resulting principal amortization also reduces our refinancing risk upon maturity of the debt. As our outstanding debt matures, we may refinance the maturing debt as it comes due or choose to repay it using cash and cash equivalents or our unsecured revolving credit facility. For example, as part of the STORE Master Funding Series 2018-1 notes issuance in October 2018, we prepaid, without penalty, an aggregate of $233.3 million of STORE Master Funding Series 2013-1 and Series 2013-2 Class A-1 notes that were scheduled to mature in 2020. Also, as part of the STORE Master Funding Series 2019-1 notes issuance in November 2019, we prepaid, without penalty, an aggregate of $186.1 million of STORE Master Funding Series 2013-3 and Series 2014-1 Class A-1 notes. In addition, as part of our third issuance of senior unsecured public notes in November 2020, we prepaid, without penalty, $92.3 million of STORE Master Funding Series 2015-1 Class A-1 notes and one of our $100 million bank term loans. Similar to the STORE Master Funding prepayments\ndescribed above, we may prepay other existing long-term debt in circumstances where we believe it would be economically advantageous to do so.\nUnsecured Revolving Credit Facility\nTypically, we use our $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility to acquire our real estate properties, until those borrowings are sufficiently large to warrant the economic issuance of long-term fixed-rate debt, the proceeds from which we use to repay the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we borrowed an additional $450 million on our unsecured revolving credit facility in March 2020 to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of the uncertainties in the markets at that time; we repaid this amount in full in August 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had no amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nOur unsecured revolving credit facility also has an accordion feature of $800 million, which gives us a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.4 billion. The facility matures in February 2022 and includes two six-month extension options, subject to certain conditions. Borrowings under the facility require monthly payments of interest at a rate selected by us of either (1) LIBOR plus a credit spread ranging from 0.825% to 1.55%, or (2) the Base Rate, as defined in the credit agreement, plus a credit spread ranging from 0.00% to 0.55%. The credit spread used is based on our credit rating as defined in the credit agreement. We are also required to pay a facility fee on the total commitment amount ranging from 0.125% to 0.30%. The currently applicable credit spread for LIBOR-based borrowings is 1.00% and the facility fee is 0.20%.\nUnder the terms of the facility, we are subject to various restrictive financial and nonfinancial covenants which, among other things, require us to maintain certain leverage ratios, cash flow and debt service coverage ratios, secured borrowing ratios and a minimum level of tangible net worth. Certain of these ratios are based on our pool of unencumbered assets, which aggregated approximately $6.1 billion at December 31, 2020. The facility is recourse to us and, as of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the financial and nonfinancial covenants under the facility and do not anticipate any compliance issues in the foreseeable future.\nSenior Unsecured Term Debt\nIn November 2020, we completed our third issuance of underwritten public notes in an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million and, as of December 31, 2020, we had an aggregate principal amount of $1.05 billion of underwritten public notes outstanding. These senior unsecured notes bear a weighted average coupon rate of 3.96% and interest on these notes is paid semi-annually in March and September or May and November of each year. The supplemental indentures governing our public notes contain various restrictive covenants, including limitations on our ability to incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with these covenants and expect to remain in compliance in the foreseeable future. Prior to our inaugural issuance of public debt in March 2018, our unsecured long-term debt had been issued through the private placement of notes to institutional investors and through groups of lenders who also participate in our unsecured revolving credit facility; the financial covenants of the privately placed notes and the remaining bank term loan are similar to our unsecured revolving credit facility. The aggregate outstanding principal amount of our unsecured senior notes and term loans payable was $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nNon-recourse Secured Debt\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 33% of our real estate investment portfolio served as collateral for outstanding borrowings under our STORE Master Funding debt program. We believe our STORE Master Funding program allows for flexibility not commonly found in non-recourse debt, often making it preferable to traditional debt issued in the commercial mortgage-backed securities market. Under the program, STORE serves as both master and special servicer for the collateral pool, allowing for active portfolio monitoring and prompt issue resolution. In addition, features of the program allowing for the sale or substitution of collateral, provided certain criteria are met, facilitate active portfolio management. Through this debt program, we arrange for bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity subsidiaries to issue multiple series of investment-grade asset-backed net-lease mortgage notes, or ABS notes, from time to time as\nadditional collateral is added to the collateral pool and leverage can be added in incremental note issuances based on the value of the collateral pool.\nThe ABS notes are generally issued by our wholly owned special purpose entity subsidiaries to institutional investors through the asset-backed securities market. These ABS notes are typically issued in two classes, Class A and Class B. At the time of issuance, the Class A notes represent approximately 70% of the appraised value of the underlying real estate collateral owned by the issuing subsidiaries and are currently rated AAA or A+ by S&P Global Ratings. The Series 2018-1 transaction in October 2018 marked our inaugural issuance of AAA rated notes and we believe it broadens the market for our STORE Master Funding debt program and gives us access to lower cost secured debt. In November 2019, our consolidated special purpose entities issued the ninth series, Series 2019-1, representing $508 million of net-lease mortgage notes under the STORE Master Funding debt program.\nThe Series 2019-1 transaction marked our inaugural issuance of 15-year notes, included $326 million of AAA rated notes and served to solidify our belief that the market for the STORE Master Funding program is broadening. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Class A notes were primarily used to pay down outstanding balances on our credit facility and to prepay, without penalty, STORE Master Funding Series 2013-3 and Series 2014-1 Class A-1 notes aggregating approximately $186.1 million at the time of prepayment; these notes were scheduled to mature in 2020 and 2021 and bore a weighted average interest rate of 4.2%.\nThe Class B notes, which are subordinated to the Class A notes as to principal repayment, represent approximately 5% of the appraised value of the underlying real estate collateral and are currently rated BBB by S&P Global Ratings. As of December 31, 2020, there was an aggregate $155.0 million in principal amount of Class B notes outstanding. We have historically retained these Class B notes and they are held by one of our bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity subsidiaries. The Class B notes are not reflected in our financial statements because they eliminate in consolidation. Since the Class B notes are considered issued and outstanding, they provide us with additional financial flexibility in that we may sell them to a third party in the future or use them as collateral for short-term borrowings as we have done from time to time in the past.\nThe ABS notes outstanding at December 31, 2020 totaled $2.0 billion in Class A principal amount and were supported by a collateral pool of approximately $3.2 billion representing 1,121 property locations operated by 207 customers. The amount of debt that can be issued in any new series is determined by the structure of the transaction and the aggregate amount of collateral in the pool at the time of issuance. In addition, the issuance of each new series of notes is subject to the satisfaction of several conditions, including that there is no event of default on the existing note series and that the issuance will not result in an event of default on, or the credit rating downgrade of, the existing note series.\nA significant portion of our cash flow is generated by the special purpose entities comprising our STORE Master Funding debt program. For the year ended December 31, 2020, excess cash flow, after payment of debt service and servicing and trustee expenses, totaled $94 million on cash collections of $233 million, which represents an overall ratio of cash collections to debt service, or debt service coverage ratio (as defined in the program documents), of nearly 1.7 to 1 on the STORE Master Funding program. For purposes of this debt service coverage ratio calculation, cash collections include the rent paid by tenants using the cash proceeds from short-term notes provided by a STORE Capital subsidiary in connection with the short-term rent deferral arrangements structured as part of our COVID-19 rent relief efforts. If at any time the debt service coverage ratio generated by the collateral pool is less than 1.3 to 1, excess cash flow from the STORE Master Funding entities will be deposited into a reserve account to be used for payments to be made on the net lease mortgage notes, to the extent there is a shortfall. We currently expect to remain above program minimum debt service coverage ratios for the foreseeable future.\nTo a lesser extent, we also may obtain debt in discrete transactions through other bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity subsidiaries, which debt is solely secured by specific real estate assets and is generally non-recourse to us (subject to certain customary limited exceptions). These discrete borrowings are generally in the form of traditional mortgage notes payable, with principal and interest payments due monthly and balloon payments due at their respective maturity dates, which typically range from seven to ten years from the date of issuance. Our secured borrowings contain various covenants customarily found in mortgage notes, including a limitation on the issuing entity's ability to incur\nadditional indebtedness on the underlying real estate. Certain of the notes also require the posting of cash reserves with the lender or trustee if specified coverage ratios are not maintained by the special purpose entity or the tenant.\nDebt Summary\nAs of December 31, 2020, our aggregate secured and unsecured long-term debt had an outstanding principal balance of $3.8 billion, a weighted average maturity of 6.6 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.2%. The following is a summary of the outstanding balance of our borrowings as well as a summary of the"}
