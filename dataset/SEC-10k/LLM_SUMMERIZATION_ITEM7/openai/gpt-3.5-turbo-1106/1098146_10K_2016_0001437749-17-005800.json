Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accounting and reporting policies of Patriot conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) and to general practices within the financial services industry. A summary of Patriot's significant accounting policies is included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements that are referenced in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Although all of Patriot's policies are integral to understanding its Consolidated Financial Statements, certain accounting policies involve Management to exercise judgment, develop assumptions, and make estimates that may have a material impact on the financial information presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements or Notes thereto. The assumptions and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors representing the best available information to Management as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, up to and including the date of issuance or availability for issuance. As the basis for the assumptions and estimates incorporated in the Consolidated Financial Statements may change, as new information comes to light, the Consolidated Financial Statements could reflect different assumptions and estimates.\nDue to the judgments, assumptions, and estimates inherent in the following policies, Management considers such accounting policies critical to an understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses ( ALL\u201d)\nThe Company maintains an ALL at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses incurred as of the report date. Management's determination of the adequacy of the ALL is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires significant estimates by management. As applicable, consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing these estimates including historical losses, peer and industry data, current economic conditions, the size and composition of the loan portfolio, delinquency statistics, criticized and classified assets and impaired loans, results of internal loan reviews, borrowers' perceived financial and management strengths, the adequacy of underlying collateral, the dependence on collateral, and the strength of the present value of future cash flows and other relevant factors. These factors may be susceptible to significant change.\nTo the extent actual outcomes differ from Management's estimates, additional provisions for loan losses may be required, which may adversely affect the Company's results of operations in the future. Subsequent to acquisition of purchased-credit-impaired loans, estimates of cash flows expected to be collected are updated each reporting period based on updated assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions. Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses; subsequent increases in expected cash flows may result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges.\nUnrealized Gains and Losses on Securities Available-for-sale\nThe Company receives estimated fair values of debt securities from independent valuation services and brokers. In developing these fair values, the valuation services and brokers use estimates of cash flows based on historical performance of similar instruments in similar rate environments. Available-for-sale debt securities consist primarily of mortgage-backed securities that are guaranteed by the U.S. government. The Company uses various indicators in determining whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired including, for debt securities, when it is probable that the contractual interest and principal will not be collected, or for equity securities, whether the market value is below its cost for an extended period of time with low expectation of recovery. The debt securities are monitored for changes in credit ratings because adverse changes in credit ratings could indicate a change in the estimated cash flows of the underlying collateral or issuer. For marketable equity securities, the Company considers the issuer's financial condition, capital strength, and near term prospects to determine whether impairment is temporary or other-than-temporary. The Company also considers the volatility of a security's price in comparison to the market as a whole and any recoveries or declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date. If management determines that the impairment is other-than-temporary, the entire amount of the impairment, as of the balance sheet date, is recognized in earnings, even if the decision to sell the security has not been made. The fair value of the security becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment and is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value. Available-for-sale debt securities were not considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2016, 2015, or 2014 because the unrealized losses were related to changes in interest rates and did not affect the expected cash flows to be received, or indicate a loss of value on the underlying collateral, or a loss of financial stability on the part of the issuer. Management concluded that the declines in fair value of the investment portfolio as of the reporting dates is temporary and that values would recover by way of increases in market price or positive changes in market interest rates.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nThe Company provides for deferred income taxes on the asset and liability approach, whereby a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effect attributable to temporary differences or carryforwards. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nAssets\nThe Company's total assets increased $103.3 million, or 15.8%, from $653.4 million at December 31, 2015 to $756.7 million at December 31, 2016. The growth in assets is primarily attributable to management's efforts to increase the amount and quality of its loan portfolio through its loan origination activities and by investing in quality loan pools, primarily funded through a growth in deposits.\nFollowing is a detailed discussion and analysis of events and transactions during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the impacts that have been realized with respect to Patriot's financial position.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents have increased $6.9 million or 8.1% as of December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 due to a number of factors including a decision to offer attractive yields on financial products to increase market share and build loyalty among depositors, continuing efforts to maintain and improve the operating cost saving initiatives that have produced positive results, and a debt issuance near year end that that allowed the Company to increase its investment in the Bank.\nInvestment securities\nPatriot's investment security portfolio has decreased $5.0 million or 14.6% from December 31, 2015 to 2016. The decrease is due to the collection of the U.S. Government agency bonds held at December 31, 2015, which bonds were yielding less than 2% and were called during 2016.\nThe total investment among the other existing investment security classes, consisting of U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, and subordinated notes has remained stable. However, a redistribution of investment among these classes has occurred, in order to maximize returns. Specifically, the investment in Government agency mortgage-backed securities has decreased $2.97 million or 22%, corporate bonds has decreased $49,000 or 0.5%, and subordinated notes have increased $3.02 million or 151.3%. The management of the investment portfolio produced a $71,000 or 15% improvement in interest income earned in 2016 over 2015.\nLoans receivable, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, management implemented a strategy to increase its liquidity by aggressively marketing its products to depositors. Through its efforts, which were initiated late in the third quarter of 2016, management was able to generate approximately $84.7 million of liquidity that, coupled with other resources, allowed for a $97.8 million or 20.4% increase in loans receivable, net that is allocable to a $49.4 million or 550% increase in loan originations and a $52.0 million increase in loan pool purchases.\nThe increase in loans receivable, gross is attributable to the loan portfolio segments as follows:\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $53.9 million or 113.5% increase in Consumer loans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $38.3 million or 246.6% increase in Construction loans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $25.4 million or 10.3% increase in Commercial Real Estate loans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $2.7 million or 55.6% increase in Construction to permanent - CRE loans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $1.2 million or 2% increase in Commercial and Industrial loans; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $24.3 million or 21.9% decrease in Residential Real Estate loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Residential Real estate loan portfolio segment is the only loan portfolio segment to experience a decrease that is primarily due to payoffs received. Management is also taking the strategic approach to focus its lending efforts on other loan portfolio segments.\nThe increase in loans receivable, net is further enhanced by improved quality in the originated loan portfolio as represented by a $567,000 or 10.8% decrease in the allowance for loan losses. This decrease resulted from a reserve and subsequent charge-off during 2016 of a single $3.0 million loan more fully described below that was offset by $149,000 in recoveries. Without the realized loss of the single loan, an improvement in the quality of loans receivable of $506,000 would have been recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016, rather than the $2.5 million provision for loan losses recognized in the results from operations.\nAlthough the general quality of the loan portfolio has measurably improved, the Bank experienced one significant loan loss during the period which occurred in its Commercial and Industrial loan portfolio segment. The loan loss occurred in the year ended December 31, 2016, accounting for $3.0 million or 120.7% of the provision for loan losses recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016. The subject loan was charged off during the fourth quarter of 2016 in the approximate amount of $3.0 million, against which loss $2.8 million of insurance proceeds were received in the first quarter of 2017. Had the loan been performing in accordance with its contractual terms, the Bank would have recognized approximately $232,000 of additional interest income during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOther than the single impaired loan experienced in 2016, impaired and non-accruing loans historically do not represent a significant impact to the Bank's loan portfolio. However, management is cognizant of the risk of extending credit to unworthy entities and, therefore, maintains strong credit approval processes to mitigate its risk.\nMaturities and Sensitivities of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates\nApproximately 63.0% of the loan portfolio is currently weighted towards long-term maturities five-years or more from December 31, 2016. The longer term of these loans provides a degree of stability to the Bank in managing its liquidity and concentrating its efforts on loan origination to higher quality, longer term relationships.\nAs a community bank, the Bank is invested in a thriving, robust local economy, which may be subject to the vagaries of general economic conditions, but which has maintained an above-national averages status with respect to capital investment. The existing conditions has led an investment in the loan portfolio weighted to Commercial Real Estate and Construction lending, which accounts for 55.9% of total loans receivable. These loans generally are collateralized by the underlying real estate and supported by personal guarantees of the borrowers.\nThe following table presents loans receivable, gross by portfolio segment, by contractual maturity as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Contractual Maturity of Loan Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One year\nor less\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One\nthrough\nFive Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> After\nFive Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan portfolio segment:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial Real Estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>173,051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>271,229 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential Real Estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,578 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86,514 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and Industrial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,449 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,977 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer and Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>501 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,608 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,449 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,640 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,255 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,895 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction to permanent - CRE\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,607 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,593 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>366,230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>581,657 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed rate loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,655 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164,360 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Variable rate loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>291,609 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>417,297 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>136,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>366,230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>581,657 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nVariable rate loans account for 71.7% of the total loan portfolio, which is attractive to the Bank in a period of increasing interest rates. $291.6 million or 69.9% of the variable rate loan portfolio matures in more than five years, which contributes a certain degree of stability to the Bank in managing both its interest rate risk and liquidity.\nPremises and equipment\nPatriot has undertaken a review and is in-process of realigning its market strategy to improve customer service and provide greater accessibility to depositors and prospective borrowers. In connection with its plan, management has initiated and is in-process of realigning its branch locations and corporate offices to improve penetration in targeted markets and utilize available properties to increase operating efficiencies and independence.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, construction-in-process has increased approximately $3 million or 87.6%, of which approximately $2.7 million or 91.2% is attributable to the build-out of the 999 Bedford Street, Stamford location that will be used to provide branch operations and house multiple corporate departments currently located in leased space. Construction-in-process has also been impacted by the renovation and build-out of a new branch location in Westport, CT located at 50 Charles Street that accounts for $0.2 million or 8.0% of the increase. Management anticipates completing construction in the second quarter of 2017, at which time the properties will be placed into service.\nOther Real Estate Owned ( OREO\u201d)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, one property was foreclosed upon and is held as OREO at December 31, 2016. On taking possession of the property in 2016, the Bank recognized an approximate $11,000 gain that represents the fair value of the property in excess of the carrying value of the loan.\nDeferred Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2016, Patriot has available approximately $45.9 million of Federal net operating loss carryforwards ( NOL\u201d) that is offset by $30.6 million in \u00a7382 limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The $15.3 million of Federal NOLs are available to offset Patriot's taxable income for periods up to and through 2032, as these NOLs expire on various dates beginning in 2029.\nAdditionally, Patriot has approximately $64.8 million of NOLs available for Connecticut tax purposes, which may be used to offset up to 50% of taxable income in any year. The NOLs have an approximate fourteen year life.\nPatriot anticipates utilizing approximately $1.1 million of its tax-effected NOLs, in respect to its 2016 tax year.\nAs of December 31, 2016, Patriot had a $12.6 million deferred tax asset, comprised of multiple temporary differences, in addition to the previously aforementioned NOLs, which management believes will be fully realized in the future. The assessment of the potential relizability of the deferred tax assets is based on observation of the condition and future of the Bank, including:\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Favorable financial performance over the past three years;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Forecasted taxable income for 2017 and future periods;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> The growth in loan originations and the overall quality of the loan portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Improvements in operations and cost management; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Net operating loss carry-forwards that do not begin to expire until 2029.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere is no guarantee that Patriot will realize the benefits of the NOLs in the future. As such, management continues to evaluate its ability to realize the benefits of the net deferred tax assets and will act accordingly if conditions change.\nDeposits\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, total deposits increased by $84.7 million or 19.0% from the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is substantially the result of a late third quarter and strong fourth quarter of 2016 effort by management to aggressively attract new depositors and strengthen the loyalty of the existing customer base by offering attractive interest rates compared to market. The effort is part of management's strategy to establish long-term relationships for sustained growth and profitability over short-term margins reflected in results. The long-term strategy is seen in the increase in interest expense on deposits of $0.2 million that is comparable to the $0.2 million decrease in advertising and marketing expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015.\nThe growth in deposits was virtually across all products offered by the Bank, except for non-interest bearing and money market accounts, which decreased by $9.0 million or 10.5% and $3.9 million or 20.1%, respectively from December 31, 2015. The decrease in non-interest bearing and money market accounts is emblematic of general market conditions and the rates of return offered by the financial services industry.\nGrowth in the all other deposit accounts may be summarized as:\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $33.6 million or 191.7% increase in Certificates of deposit that are greater than $250,000;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $25.1 million or 23.7% increase in Savings accounts;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $21.2 million or 15.2% increase in Certificates of deposit that are less than $250,000;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $15.7 million or 32.8% increase in Brokered deposits; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $2.0 million of 7.0% increase in NOW accounts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in deposits, most notably in the category of time certificates greater than $250,000 signifies the success of management in strengthening the Bank's liquidity by refocusing its operations on its customer base. The results of these efforts is easily viewed in comparison with the daily average balances that follow, which display a contrasting change in daily average balances of interest bearing deposits in virtually all categories.\nBorrowings\nPatriot's borrowings increased by approximately $17.5 million or 12.3% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. Borrowings consist primarily of FHLB advances, but also include senior notes, junior subordinated debentures, and a note payable to the seller from whom the Fairfield branch building was purchased in 2015.\nFHLB advances decreased by $9.0 million or 6.8% at December 31, 2016 compared to 2015, which decrease is primarily attributable to normal operations. The Bank maintains strong standing with the FHLB and its Well Capitalized\u201d designation with the FDIC, as provided below.\nIn December 2016, the Bank entered into a $16 million revolving line of credit agreement with a correspondent bank. The line of credit was obtained to provide short-term liquidity to satisfy overnight Fed account balance requirements and to provide for daily settlement of FRB, ACH, and other clearinghouse transactions. At December 31, 2016, $15.0 million was outstanding under the line of credit, which amount was repaid early in January 2017.\nIn December 2016, the Company issued $12 million of 7% senior unsecured notes in a private placement to accredited institutional investors. The notes mature in December 2021, require the payment of interest on a semi-annual basis, require interest-only through maturity, and are neither callable by the Company nor putable by the holders. The Company used approximately $7.2 million of the proceeds from the note issuance to bolster its investment in the Bank, which capital contribution qualifies for Tier 1 Capital of the Bank.\nShareholders' Equity\nIn July 2016, the Company authorized a one-year stock repurchase program whereby management may repurchase up to 500,000 shares of common stock through July 2017. The program authorizes management, at the direction of the Company's chairman, to repurchase shares on the open-market or in private transactions, in accordance with applicable security laws and regulations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, 72,471 shares of common stock were repurchased in a combination of open market and private transactions at an average cost of $14.04 per share or $1.0 million. The repurchased shares increased shares held in treasury from $0.2 million at December 31, 2015 to $1.2 million at December 31, 2016 or a 635.6% increase. Approximately 68,500 shares repurchased and entered into treasury relate to shares held by a former officer of the Company, which shares were repurchased at an average cost of $14.05. Management views the buy-back program as a valuable means to increase shareholder value through lowering the cost of capital and increasing the book value per share.\nAverage Balances\nThe following table presents daily average balance sheets, interest income, interest expense and the corresponding yields earned and rates paid for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,

($0.55 per share) for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIncome before tax expense was $3.1 million compared to 2015's income before income tax expense of $3.5 million.

Net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them, respectively.\nNet interest income increased $1.3 million in 2016 over the previous year as focused growth and diversification in the loan portfolio yielded an increase in interest income. In order to achieve this, the Bank originated $94.7 million in commercial real estate loans and $14.7 million in construction loans. Average loan balances were $29.8 million higher in 2016 than in 2015, as loan payoffs continued throughout 2016. Average yields on loans increased slightly to 4.67% from 4.65% in 2015 as the Bank operates in a very competitive market. Additionally, the Bank purchased two refinanced education loan pools totaling $52.0 million with a weighted average stated interest rate of approximately 5.3% from an originator who used targeted marketing to source qualified borrowers and applied strong credit standards similar to the Bank's credit guidelines.\nAverage yields on investment securities improved in 2016 to 2.39% from 1.71% in 2015 resulting in higher interest income of $137,000. This increase was primarily due to the purchase of subordinated bonds from two creditworthy financial institutions during 2016 each yielding 5% or greater. One government sponsored bond was called in 2016 which yielded under 2%.\nAs the loan pipeline began to grow during 2016, so did the need to increase the Bank's deposit base and liquidity sources. In the second half of 2016, the Bank initiated a certificate of deposits (CD) program to attract term deposits at competitive rates. The program was successful and achieved over $50 million in CDs in just five months. The average term of the new CDs was 15 months.\nTotal deposit interest expense increased $226,000 to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was related to the deposit initiative as well as the increase in the use of broker deposits as a funding source. The average rate on interest bearing deposits increased from 54.8 basis points in 2015 to 55.3 basis points in 2016.\nInterest expense on borrowings increased $92,000 from 2015. Interest expense on subordinated debt increased $40,000 from 2015, primarily due to incremental increase in three month LIBOR throughout 2016 which is the index this coupon is based upon.\nIn December 2016, the Company completed the issuance, through a private placement, of $12 million aggregate principal amount of 7.0% fixed senior unsecured notes due December 22, 2021 (the Notes\u201d). The Company intends to use the proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes, which will include advances to the Bank to finance growth activities. In December, the Company advanced $7.2 million to the Bank which qualifies as Tier 1 capital.\nThe Notes were issued pursuant to a Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 22, 2016, between the Company and accredited institutional investors. The Notes bear a fixed interest rate of 7.00% per annum from and including December 22, 2016 to but excluding December 22, 2021 and are payable semi-annually in arrears on June 22 and December 22 of each year, beginning June 22, 2017. The Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the Company. Principal and interest on the Notes are subject to acceleration only in limited circumstances. The senior notes issued increased interest expense by $25,000 in 2016.\nManagement regularly reviews loan and deposit rates and strives to price the Bank's products competitively. The Bank tracks its mix of asset and liability maturities and manages its balance sheet in an effort to maintain a reasonable maturity match, between the two.\nProvision for loan losses\nIn 2016, loans outstanding grew $98 million over 2015 after loan payoffs and paydowns. With the exception of one commercial loan, the performance and credit quality of the portfolio continues to strengthen. In the second half of 2016, the Bank determined that an increase the loan loss reserve for one specific loan was required due to information and further analysis regarding the full collectability of this loan. To fully reserve for this loan, the Bank recognized a $3.0 million provision for loan losses in the year ended December 31, 2016, consisting of a $1 million provision in the first quarter of 2016 and an additional provision of $2 million in the second quarter of 2016, when it became clear that a total loss on the loan was imminent.\nDespite the Bank's position that this loan should be fully reserved as of December 31, 2016, the Bank commenced recovery actions across all available avenues, including insurance coverage and claims against third parties. Potential insurance coverage, under which the Bank has sought recovery, includes a Financial Institution Bond with a limit of liability of $5,000,000 above a $50,000 deductible. The Bank has vigorously pursued its avenues of recovery, including insurance coverage and third party claims. In March 2017, the Bank received $2.8 million of insurance proceeds against the loss recognized on the subject loan.\nNon-interest income\nNon-interest income of $1.6 million was recorded for 2016 and was consistent with the results of 2015. This category includes loan fees, deposit service charges, rental income and miscellaneous income. In 2015, non-interest income totaled $1.6 million.\nNon-interest expense\nIn 2016, the Company continued its efforts of monitoring and controlling costs. Vendor management and evaluations were conducted in order to make certain the quality, level of service and expense expectations of vendors were in line with contractual agreements, some employee benefit costs were reduced, or in some cases, benefits modified to prevent future cost increases, and office occupancy costs were re-examined. Non-interest expense decreased $496,000, or 2.6%, to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAs the Bank grew in 2016, additional client facing and support team members were necessary. As such, salary and related benefit costs increased by $810,000. However, incentive savings of $176,000 and an increase in deferred loan costs credit of $340,000, due to the increase in loans originated in 2016, offset some of this additional staff expense.\nThe 2016 full year impact of relocating into new branches in 2015 benefited occupancy costs with approximately $350,000 in expense reductions. In 2015, there was a non-cash charge of $133,000 associated with the abandonment of leasehold improvements relating to the Fairfield branch building. There were no similar charges recorded in 2016.\nIn discussions with one of the Bank's data system providers, the Bank was able to negotiate specific terms to include offsetting future credits for services provided. In 2016, $150,000 in credits was applied to some invoices.\nProfessional and other outside services increased $91,000 primarily due to legal fees resulting from the recovery actions taken in 2016 with regards to the one commercial loan mentioned above in the Provision for Loan Losses\u201d section.\nAdvertising and promotional expense decreased approximately $200,000 relating to the Bank's change in its service providers and its focus on specific initiatives.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the years 2015 and 2014\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded net income of $2.1 million ($.55 per share) compared to a net income of $15.7 million ($4.08 per share) for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIncome before income tax expense was $3.5 million, an increase of $2.5 million compared to income before income tax expense of $1.0 million in 2014.\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Net interest income increased $3.7 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Provision for loan losses increased $250,000;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Non-interest income decreased $281,000; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Non-interest expense increased $580,000.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe positive results for 2015 were primarily due to balance sheet and operational restructuring initiatives implemented during 2013, 2014 and 2015 by the new executive management team. These initiatives included:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Replacement of high cost borrowings at significantly lower rates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Strategic repricing of deposits.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Streamlining of branch and back office operations and exiting the Residential Lending business, resulting in non-interest expense reductions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Negotiating vendor price concessions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Purchasing three branch buildings where the cost of the leases exceeded the cost to own the properties.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's improved earnings and balance sheet resulting from the initiatives noted and continued drive for efficiencies enabled the Company to recognize a $16.8 million income tax benefit in the third quarter of 2014 via reversal of most of the valuation allowance against its Deferred Tax Asset ( DTA\u201d). Recognition of the DTA increased regulatory capital, enabling The Company to increase its asset base.\nNet interest Income\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them, respectively.\nNet interest income increased $3.7 million from $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Total interest and dividend income increased $3.4 million, or 16.6%, primarily as a result of higher average loan balances.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Average loan balances were $65.2 million higher in 2015 than in 2014, including an increase in the average commercial and commercial real estate loan balance of $57.7 million.

The Company tracks its mix of asset and liability maturities and manages its balance sheet in an effort to maintain a reasonable maturity match, between the two.\nProvision for loan losses\nDuring 2015, the Company recorded a $250,000 provision for loan losses in the first quarter due to the growth of the loan portfolio. As the year progressed, loan originations were partial offset by loan payoffs. Overall, the credit quality of the loan portfolio continues to improve as the amount of classified assets outstanding has declined and the overall risk rating for the portfolio has improved which has enabled the Company to maintain its loan loss reserve level with no additional provision requirements for the remainder of 2015.\nNon-interest income\nNon-interest income decreased by $281,000, or 15.3%, from $1.8 million in 2014 to $1.6 million in 2015. Non-interest income for 2014 included a $455,000 loss on disposition of the Bank's BOLI policy, offset by $439,000 earnings on cash surrender value of the Bank's Policy. Lower deposit fees and service charges of $284,000 in 2015 are primarily due to lower overdraft fees as a result of closing frequently overdrawn accounts due to credit risk reasons.\nPartially offsetting the noted changes was incremental rental income of approximately $47,000.\nNon-interest expense\nNon-interest expense increased $580,000, or 3.2%, from $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Non-interest expense in 2014 included expense of $437,000 related to tax penalty for disposition of the BOLI policy. Non- interest expense in 2015 included the following differences:\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Salaries and benefits were increased by $1.2 million, primarily due to personnel increases to support the Company's growth.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Professional and other outside services decreased $656,000 primarily due to lower legal fees resulting from improved asset quality, renegotiation of several vendor contracts and reduced consultant usage.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Regulatory assessments reduction of $276,000 primarily due to improved ratings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Advertising and promotional expense increased $339,000 primarily due to the Company changing its overall business strategy and focus as the Bank changed its name and redefined its approach to the way it provides value to its customers, community and the market place.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Year ended 2015, also includes a $133,000 non-cash charge, primarily associated with the abandonment of leasehold improvements in conjunction with the purchase of the Company's Fairfield branch building.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLIQUIDITY\nPatriot's liquidity position was 14.9% and 16.7% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The liquidity ratio is defined as the ratio of liquid assets to total assets. The following categories of assets as described in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets are considered liquid assets: cash and due from banks, federal funds sold (if any), short-term investments (if any) and available-for-sale securities which have not been pledged. Liquidity is a measure of Patriot's ability to generate adequate cash to meet its financial obligations.\nThe principal cash requirements of the Bank are to cover increases in its loan portfolio and downward fluctuations in deposit accounts. Management believes that Patriot's liquid assets provide sufficient coverage to satisfy loan demand, cover potential fluctuations in deposit accounts, and to meet other anticipated operational cash requirements.\nAt December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents and unpledged available-for-sale securities amounted to $92.3 million and $20.2 million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Bank had additional borrowing capacity of $16.2 million available from FHLB Boston, which is comprised of $14.2 million of advances and a $2.0 million overnight line of credit. These amounts are in addition to the FHLB advances of $123 million that are outstanding at December 31, 2016. Additionally, the Bank has the ability to borrow from the FRB.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the maturities of Patriot's contractual obligations are as follows:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Contractual Obligations Due\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligation Catgegory\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\nOne Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One to\nThree Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Three to\nFive Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Over\nFive\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>144,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>211,686 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brokered deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,932 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Correspondent bank - line of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Junior subordinated debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,248 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Note payable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>189 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>401 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,769 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,172 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>282,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,936 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,655 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,212 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>436,807 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Bank's off-balance sheet commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the borrower.

Under the regulatory framework for prompt correction action, to be considered well capitalized,\u201d an institution must generally have a leverage capital ratio of at least 5.0%, Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%. However, the OCC has the discretion to require increased capital ratios.\nUnder the final capital rules that became effective on January 1, 2015, there is a requirement for a CET1 Capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which is in addition to the other minimum risk-based capital standards in the rule. Institutions that do not maintain this required capital buffer become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that may be distributed to shareholders or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management.\nThe capital buffer requirement is being phased in over three years beginning in 2016. The 0.625% capital conservation buffer increase for 2016 has been included in the minimum capital adequacy ratios in the table above. The capital buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required Total Capital ratio to 10.5%, the Tier 1 Capital ratio to 8.5%, and the CET1 Capital ratio to 7.0% on a fully phased-in basis, which will be effective beginning on January 1, 2019. Management believes that, as of December 31, 2016, Patriot satisfies all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis, as if all such requirements were currently in effect.\nManagement continuously assesses the adequacy of the Bank's capital with the goal to maintain a well capitalized\u201d classification.", "summary": "The report provides Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for Patriot, including critical accounting policies such as allowance for loan losses, unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale, and deferred income taxes.

"ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accounting and reporting policies of Patriot conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) and to general practices within the financial services industry. A summary of Patriot's significant accounting policies is included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements that are referenced in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Although all of Patriot's policies are integral to understanding its Consolidated Financial Statements, certain accounting policies involve Management to exercise judgment, develop assumptions, and make estimates that may have a material impact on the financial information presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements or Notes thereto. The assumptions and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors representing the best available information to Management as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, up to and including the date of issuance or availability for issuance. As the basis for the assumptions and estimates incorporated in the Consolidated Financial Statements may change, as new information comes to light, the Consolidated Financial Statements could reflect different assumptions and estimates.\nDue to the judgments, assumptions, and estimates inherent in the following policies, Management considers such accounting policies critical to an understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses ( ALL\u201d)\nThe Company maintains an ALL at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses incurred as of the report date. Management's determination of the adequacy of the ALL is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires significant estimates by management. As applicable, consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing these estimates including historical losses, peer and industry data, current economic conditions, the size and composition of the loan portfolio, delinquency statistics, criticized and classified assets and impaired loans, results of internal loan reviews, borrowers' perceived financial and management strengths, the adequacy of underlying collateral, the dependence on collateral, and the strength of the present value of future cash flows and other relevant factors. These factors may be susceptible to significant change.\nTo the extent actual outcomes differ from Management's estimates, additional provisions for loan losses may be required, which may adversely affect the Company's results of operations in the future. Subsequent to acquisition of purchased-credit-impaired loans, estimates of cash flows expected to be collected are updated each reporting period based on updated assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions. Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses; subsequent increases in expected cash flows may result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges.\nUnrealized Gains and Losses on Securities Available-for-sale\nThe Company receives estimated fair values of debt securities from independent valuation services and brokers. In developing these fair values, the valuation services and brokers use estimates of cash flows based on historical performance of similar instruments in similar rate environments. Available-for-sale debt securities consist primarily of mortgage-backed securities that are guaranteed by the U.S. government. The Company uses various indicators in determining whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired including, for debt securities, when it is probable that the contractual interest and principal will not be collected, or for equity securities, whether the market value is below its cost for an extended period of time with low expectation of recovery. The debt securities are monitored for changes in credit ratings because adverse changes in credit ratings could indicate a change in the estimated cash flows of the underlying collateral or issuer. For marketable equity securities, the Company considers the issuer's financial condition, capital strength, and near term prospects to determine whether impairment is temporary or other-than-temporary. The Company also considers the volatility of a security's price in comparison to the market as a whole and any recoveries or declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date. If management determines that the impairment is other-than-temporary, the entire amount of the impairment, as of the balance sheet date, is recognized in earnings, even if the decision to sell the security has not been made. The fair value of the security becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment and is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value. Available-for-sale debt securities were not considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2016, 2015, or 2014 because the unrealized losses were related to changes in interest rates and did not affect the expected cash flows to be received, or indicate a loss of value on the underlying collateral, or a loss of financial stability on the part of the issuer. Management concluded that the declines in fair value of the investment portfolio as of the reporting dates is temporary and that values would recover by way of increases in market price or positive changes in market interest rates.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nThe Company provides for deferred income taxes on the asset and liability approach, whereby a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effect attributable to temporary differences or carryforwards. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nAssets\nThe Company's total assets increased $103.3 million, or 15.8%, from $653.4 million at December 31, 2015 to $756.7 million at December 31, 2016. The growth in assets is primarily attributable to management's efforts to increase the amount and quality of its loan portfolio through its loan origination activities and by investing in quality loan pools, primarily funded through a growth in deposits.\nFollowing is a detailed discussion and analysis of events and transactions during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the impacts that have been realized with respect to Patriot's financial position.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents have increased $6.9 million or 8.1% as of December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 due to a number of factors including a decision to offer attractive yields on financial products to increase market share and build loyalty among depositors, continuing efforts to maintain and improve the operating cost saving initiatives that have produced positive results, and a debt issuance near year end that that allowed the Company to increase its investment in the Bank.\nInvestment securities\nPatriot's investment security portfolio has decreased $5.0 million or 14.6% from December 31, 2015 to 2016. The decrease is due to the collection of the U.S. Government agency bonds held at December 31, 2015, which bonds were yielding less than 2% and were called during 2016.\nThe total investment among the other existing investment security classes, consisting of U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, and subordinated notes has remained stable. However, a redistribution of investment among these classes has occurred, in order to maximize returns. Specifically, the investment in Government agency mortgage-backed securities has decreased $2.97 million or 22%, corporate bonds has decreased $49,000 or 0.5%, and subordinated notes have increased $3.02 million or 151.3%. The management of the investment portfolio produced a $71,000 or 15% improvement in interest income earned in 2016 over 2015.\nLoans receivable, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, management implemented a strategy to increase its liquidity by aggressively marketing its products to depositors. Through its efforts, which were initiated late in the third quarter of 2016, management was able to generate approximately $84.7 million of liquidity that, coupled with other resources, allowed for a $97.8 million or 20.4% increase in loans receivable, net that is allocable to a $49.4 million or 550% increase in loan originations and a $52.0 million increase in loan pool purchases.\nThe increase in loans receivable, gross is attributable to the loan portfolio segments as follows:\n \u25cf $53.9 million or 113.5% increase in Consumer loans; \n \u25cf $38.3 million or 246.6% increase in Construction loans; \n \u25cf $25.4 million or 10.3% increase in Commercial Real Estate loans; \n \u25cf $2.7 million or 55.6% increase in Construction to permanent - CRE loans; \n \u25cf $1.2 million or 2% increase in Commercial and Industrial loans; and \n \u25cf $24.3 million or 21.9% decrease in Residential Real Estate loans. \nThe Residential Real estate loan portfolio segment is the only loan portfolio segment to experience a decrease that is primarily due to payoffs received. Management is also taking the strategic approach to focus its lending efforts on other loan portfolio segments.\nThe increase in loans receivable, net is further enhanced by improved quality in the originated loan portfolio as represented by a $567,000 or 10.8% decrease in the allowance for loan losses. This decrease resulted from a reserve and subsequent charge-off during 2016 of a single $3.0 million loan more fully described below that was offset by $149,000 in recoveries. Without the realized loss of the single loan, an improvement in the quality of loans receivable of $506,000 would have been recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016, rather than the $2.5 million provision for loan losses recognized in the results from operations.\nAlthough the general quality of the loan portfolio has measurably improved, the Bank experienced one significant loan loss during the period which occurred in its Commercial and Industrial loan portfolio segment. The loan loss occurred in the year ended December 31, 2016, accounting for $3.0 million or 120.7% of the provision for loan losses recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016. The subject loan was charged off during the fourth quarter of 2016 in the approximate amount of $3.0 million, against which loss $2.8 million of insurance proceeds were received in the first quarter of 2017. Had the loan been performing in accordance with its contractual terms, the Bank would have recognized approximately $232,000 of additional interest income during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOther than the single impaired loan experienced in 2016, impaired and non-accruing loans historically do not represent a significant impact to the Bank's loan portfolio. However, management is cognizant of the risk of extending credit to unworthy entities and, therefore, maintains strong credit approval processes to mitigate its risk.\nMaturities and Sensitivities of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates\nApproximately 63.0% of the loan portfolio is currently weighted towards long-term maturities five-years or more from December 31, 2016. The longer term of these loans provides a degree of stability to the Bank in managing its liquidity and concentrating its efforts on loan origination to higher quality, longer term relationships.\nAs a community bank, the Bank is invested in a thriving, robust local economy, which may be subject to the vagaries of general economic conditions, but which has maintained an above-national averages status with respect to capital investment. The existing conditions has led an investment in the loan portfolio weighted to Commercial Real Estate and Construction lending, which accounts for 55.9% of total loans receivable. These loans generally are collateralized by the underlying real estate and supported by personal guarantees of the borrowers.\nThe following table presents loans receivable, gross by portfolio segment, by contractual maturity as of December 31, 2016:\n\nVariable rate loans account for 71.7% of the total loan portfolio, which is attractive to the Bank in a period of increasing interest rates. $291.6 million or 69.9% of the variable rate loan portfolio matures in more than five years, which contributes a certain degree of stability to the Bank in managing both its interest rate risk and liquidity.\nPremises and equipment\nPatriot has undertaken a review and is in-process of realigning its market strategy to improve customer service and provide greater accessibility to depositors and prospective borrowers. In connection with its plan, management has initiated and is in-process of realigning its branch locations and corporate offices to improve penetration in targeted markets and utilize available properties to increase operating efficiencies and independence.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, construction-in-process has increased approximately $3 million or 87.6%, of which approximately $2.7 million or 91.2% is attributable to the build-out of the 999 Bedford Street, Stamford location that will be used to provide branch operations and house multiple corporate departments currently located in leased space. Construction-in-process has also been impacted by the renovation and build-out of a new branch location in Westport, CT located at 50 Charles Street that accounts for $0.2 million or 8.0% of the increase. Management anticipates completing construction in the second quarter of 2017, at which time the properties will be placed into service.\nOther Real Estate Owned ( OREO\u201d)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, one property was foreclosed upon and is held as OREO at December 31, 2016. On taking possession of the property in 2016, the Bank recognized an approximate $11,000 gain that represents the fair value of the property in excess of the carrying value of the loan.\nDeferred Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2016, Patriot has available approximately $45.9 million of Federal net operating loss carryforwards ( NOL\u201d) that is offset by $30.6 million in \u00a7382 limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The $15.3 million of Federal NOLs are available to offset Patriot's taxable income for periods up to and through 2032, as these NOLs expire on various dates beginning in 2029.\nAdditionally, Patriot has approximately $64.8 million of NOLs available for Connecticut tax purposes, which may be used to offset up to 50% of taxable income in any year. The NOLs have an approximate fourteen year life.\nPatriot anticipates utilizing approximately $1.1 million of its tax-effected NOLs, in respect to its 2016 tax year.\nAs of December 31, 2016, Patriot had a $12.6 million deferred tax asset, comprised of multiple temporary differences, in addition to the previously aforementioned NOLs, which management believes will be fully realized in the future. The assessment of the potential relizability of the deferred tax assets is based on observation of the condition and future of the Bank, including:\n \u25cf Favorable financial performance over the past three years; \n \u25cf Forecasted taxable income for 2017 and future periods; \n \u25cf The growth in loan originations and the overall quality of the loan portfolio; \n \u25cf Improvements in operations and cost management; and \n \u25cf Net operating loss carry-forwards that do not begin to expire until 2029. \nThere is no guarantee that Patriot will realize the benefits of the NOLs in the future. As such, management continues to evaluate its ability to realize the benefits of the net deferred tax assets and will act accordingly if conditions change.\nDeposits\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, total deposits increased by $84.7 million or 19.0% from the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is substantially the result of a late third quarter and strong fourth quarter of 2016 effort by management to aggressively attract new depositors and strengthen the loyalty of the existing customer base by offering attractive interest rates compared to market. The effort is part of management's strategy to establish long-term relationships for sustained growth and profitability over short-term margins reflected in results. The long-term strategy is seen in the increase in interest expense on deposits of $0.2 million that is comparable to the $0.2 million decrease in advertising and marketing expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015.\nThe growth in deposits was virtually across all products offered by the Bank, except for non-interest bearing and money market accounts, which decreased by $9.0 million or 10.5% and $3.9 million or 20.1%, respectively from December 31, 2015. The decrease in non-interest bearing and money market accounts is emblematic of general market conditions and the rates of return offered by the financial services industry.\nGrowth in the all other deposit accounts may be summarized as:\n\nThe increase in deposits, most notably in the category of time certificates greater than $250,000 signifies the success of management in strengthening the Bank's liquidity by refocusing its operations on its customer base. The results of these efforts is easily viewed in comparison with the daily average balances that follow, which display a contrasting change in daily average balances of interest bearing deposits in virtually all categories.\nBorrowings\nPatriot's borrowings increased by approximately $17.5 million or 12.3% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. Borrowings consist primarily of FHLB advances, but also include senior notes, junior subordinated debentures, and a note payable to the seller from whom the Fairfield branch building was purchased in 2015.\nFHLB advances decreased by $9.0 million or 6.8% at December 31, 2016 compared to 2015, which decrease is primarily attributable to normal operations. The Bank maintains strong standing with the FHLB and its Well Capitalized\u201d designation with the FDIC, as provided below.\nIn December 2016, the Bank entered into a $16 million revolving line of credit agreement with a correspondent bank. The line of credit was obtained to provide short-term liquidity to satisfy overnight Fed account balance requirements and to provide for daily settlement of FRB, ACH, and other clearinghouse transactions. At December 31, 2016, $15.0 million was outstanding under the line of credit, which amount was repaid early in January 2017.\nIn December 2016, the Company issued $12 million of 7% senior unsecured notes in a private placement to accredited institutional investors. The notes mature in December 2021, require the payment of interest on a semi-annual basis, require interest-only through maturity, and are neither callable by the Company nor putable by the holders. The Company used approximately $7.2 million of the proceeds from the note issuance to bolster its investment in the Bank, which capital contribution qualifies for Tier 1 Capital of the Bank.\nShareholders' Equity\nIn July 2016, the Company authorized a one-year stock repurchase program whereby management may repurchase up to 500,000 shares of common stock through July 2017. The program authorizes management, at the direction of the Company's chairman, to repurchase shares on the open-market or in private transactions, in accordance with applicable security laws and regulations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, 72,471 shares of common stock were repurchased in a combination of open market and private transactions at an average cost of $14.04 per share or $1.0 million. The repurchased shares increased shares held in treasury from $0.2 million at December 31, 2015 to $1.2 million at December 31, 2016 or a 635.6% increase. Approximately 68,500 shares repurchased and entered into treasury relate to shares held by a former officer of the Company, which shares were repurchased at an average cost of $14.05. Management views the buy-back program as a valuable means to increase shareholder value through lowering the cost of capital and increasing the book value per share.\nAverage Balances\nThe following table presents daily average balance sheets, interest income, interest expense and the corresponding yields earned and rates paid for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016.\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accounting and reporting policies of Patriot conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) and to general practices within the financial services industry. A summary of Patriot's significant accounting policies is included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements that are referenced in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Although all of Patriot's policies are integral to understanding its Consolidated Financial Statements, certain accounting policies involve Management to exercise judgment, develop assumptions, and make estimates that may have a material impact on the financial information presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements or Notes thereto. The assumptions and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors representing the best available information to Management as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, up to and including the date of issuance or availability for issuance. As the basis for the assumptions and estimates incorporated in the Consolidated Financial Statements may change, as new information comes to light, the Consolidated Financial Statements could reflect different assumptions and estimates.\nDue to the judgments, assumptions, and estimates inherent in the following policies, Management considers such accounting policies critical to an understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses ( ALL\u201d)\nThe Company maintains an ALL at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses incurred as of the report date. Management's determination of the adequacy of the ALL is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires significant estimates by management. As applicable, consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing these estimates including historical losses, peer and industry data, current economic conditions, the size and composition of the loan portfolio, delinquency statistics, criticized and classified assets and impaired loans, results of internal loan reviews, borrowers' perceived financial and management strengths, the adequacy of underlying collateral, the dependence on collateral, and the strength of the present value of future cash flows and other relevant factors. These factors may be susceptible to significant change.\nTo the extent actual outcomes differ from Management's estimates, additional provisions for loan losses may be required, which may adversely affect the Company's results of operations in the future. Subsequent to acquisition of purchased-credit-impaired loans, estimates of cash flows expected to be collected are updated each reporting period based on updated assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions. Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses; subsequent increases in expected cash flows may result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges.\nUnrealized Gains and Losses on Securities Available-for-sale\nThe Company receives estimated fair values of debt securities from independent valuation services and brokers. In developing these fair values, the valuation services and brokers use estimates of cash flows based on historical performance of similar instruments in similar rate environments. Available-for-sale debt securities consist primarily of mortgage-backed securities that are guaranteed by the U.S. government. The Company uses various indicators in determining whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired including, for debt securities, when it is probable that the contractual interest and principal will not be collected, or for equity securities, whether the market value is below its cost for an extended period of time with low expectation of recovery. The debt securities are monitored for changes in credit ratings because adverse changes in credit ratings could indicate a change in the estimated cash flows of the underlying collateral or issuer. For marketable equity securities, the Company considers the issuer's financial condition, capital strength, and near term prospects to determine whether impairment is temporary or other-than-temporary. The Company also considers the volatility of a security's price in comparison to the market as a whole and any recoveries or declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date. If management determines that the impairment is other-than-temporary, the entire amount of the impairment, as of the balance sheet date, is recognized in earnings, even if the decision to sell the security has not been made. The fair value of the security becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment and is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value. Available-for-sale debt securities were not considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2016, 2015, or 2014 because the unrealized losses were related to changes in interest rates and did not affect the expected cash flows to be received, or indicate a loss of value on the underlying collateral, or a loss of financial stability on the part of the issuer. Management concluded that the declines in fair value of the investment portfolio as of the reporting dates is temporary and that values would recover by way of increases in market price or positive changes in market interest rates.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nThe Company provides for deferred income taxes on the asset and liability approach, whereby a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effect attributable to temporary differences or carryforwards. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nAssets\nThe Company's total assets increased $103.3 million, or 15.8%, from $653.4 million at December 31, 2015 to $756.7 million at December 31, 2016. The growth in assets is primarily attributable to management's efforts to increase the amount and quality of its loan portfolio through its loan origination activities and by investing in quality loan pools, primarily funded through a growth in deposits.\nFollowing is a detailed discussion and analysis of events and transactions during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the impacts that have been realized with respect to Patriot's financial position.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents have increased $6.9 million or 8.1% as of December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 due to a number of factors including a decision to offer attractive yields on financial products to increase market share and build loyalty among depositors, continuing efforts to maintain and improve the operating cost saving initiatives that have produced positive results, and a debt issuance near year end that that allowed the Company to increase its investment in the Bank.\nInvestment securities\nPatriot's investment security portfolio has decreased $5.0 million or 14.6% from December 31, 2015 to 2016. The decrease is due to the collection of the U.S. Government agency bonds held at December 31, 2015, which bonds were yielding less than 2% and were called during 2016.\nThe total investment among the other existing investment security classes, consisting of U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, and subordinated notes has remained stable. However, a redistribution of investment among these classes has occurred, in order to maximize returns. Specifically, the investment in Government agency mortgage-backed securities has decreased $2.97 million or 22%, corporate bonds has decreased $49,000 or 0.5%, and subordinated notes have increased $3.02 million or 151.3%. The management of the investment portfolio produced a $71,000 or 15% improvement in interest income earned in 2016 over 2015.\nLoans receivable, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, management implemented a strategy to increase its liquidity by aggressively marketing its products to depositors. Through its efforts, which were initiated late in the third quarter of 2016, management was able to generate approximately $84.7 million of liquidity that, coupled with other resources, allowed for a $97.8 million or 20.4% increase in loans receivable, net that is allocable to a $49.4 million or 550% increase in loan originations and a $52.0 million increase in loan pool purchases.\nThe increase in loans receivable, gross is attributable to the loan portfolio segments as follows:\n \u25cf $53.9 million or 113.5% increase in Consumer loans; \n \u25cf $38.3 million or 246.6% increase in Construction loans; \n \u25cf $25.4 million or 10.3% increase in Commercial Real Estate loans; \n \u25cf $2.7 million or 55.6% increase in Construction to permanent - CRE loans; \n \u25cf $1.2 million or 2% increase in Commercial and Industrial loans; and \n \u25cf $24.3 million or 21.9% decrease in Residential Real Estate loans. \nThe Residential Real estate loan portfolio segment is the only loan portfolio segment to experience a decrease that is primarily due to payoffs received. Management is also taking the strategic approach to focus its lending efforts on other loan portfolio segments.\nThe increase in loans receivable, net is further enhanced by improved quality in the originated loan portfolio as represented by a $567,000 or 10.8% decrease in the allowance for loan losses. This decrease resulted from a reserve and subsequent charge-off during 2016 of a single $3.0 million loan more fully described below that was offset by $149,000 in recoveries. Without the realized loss of the single loan, an improvement in the quality of loans receivable of $506,000 would have been recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016, rather than the $2.5 million provision for loan losses recognized in the results from operations.\nAlthough the general quality of the loan portfolio has measurably improved, the Bank experienced one significant loan loss during the period which occurred in its Commercial and Industrial loan portfolio segment. The loan loss occurred in the year ended December 31, 2016, accounting for $3.0 million or 120.7% of the provision for loan losses recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016. The subject loan was charged off during the fourth quarter of 2016 in the approximate amount of $3.0 million, against which loss $2.8 million of insurance proceeds were received in the first quarter of 2017. Had the loan been performing in accordance with its contractual terms, the Bank would have recognized approximately $232,000 of additional interest income during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOther than the single impaired loan experienced in 2016, impaired and non-accruing loans historically do not represent a significant impact to the Bank's loan portfolio. However, management is cognizant of the risk of extending credit to unworthy entities and, therefore, maintains strong credit approval processes to mitigate its risk.\nMaturities and Sensitivities of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates\nApproximately 63.0% of the loan portfolio is currently weighted towards long-term maturities five-years or more from December 31, 2016. The longer term of these loans provides a degree of stability to the Bank in managing its liquidity and concentrating its efforts on loan origination to higher quality, longer term relationships.\nAs a community bank, the Bank is invested in a thriving, robust local economy, which may be subject to the vagaries of general economic conditions, but which has maintained an above-national averages status with respect to capital investment. The existing conditions has led an investment in the loan portfolio weighted to Commercial Real Estate and Construction lending, which accounts for 55.9% of total loans receivable. These loans generally are collateralized by the underlying real estate and supported by personal guarantees of the borrowers.\nThe following table presents loans receivable, gross by portfolio segment, by contractual maturity as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Contractual Maturity of Loan Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One year\nor less\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One\nthrough\nFive Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> After\nFive Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan portfolio segment:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial Real Estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>173,051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>271,229 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential Real Estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,578 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86,514 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and Industrial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,449 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,977 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer and Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>501 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,608 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,449 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,640 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,255 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,895 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction to permanent - CRE\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,607 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,593 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>366,230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>581,657 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed rate loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,655 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164,360 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Variable rate loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>291,609 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>417,297 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>136,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>366,230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>581,657 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nVariable rate loans account for 71.7% of the total loan portfolio, which is attractive to the Bank in a period of increasing interest rates. $291.6 million or 69.9% of the variable rate loan portfolio matures in more than five years, which contributes a certain degree of stability to the Bank in managing both its interest rate risk and liquidity.\nPremises and equipment\nPatriot has undertaken a review and is in-process of realigning its market strategy to improve customer service and provide greater accessibility to depositors and prospective borrowers. In connection with its plan, management has initiated and is in-process of realigning its branch locations and corporate offices to improve penetration in targeted markets and utilize available properties to increase operating efficiencies and independence.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, construction-in-process has increased approximately $3 million or 87.6%, of which approximately $2.7 million or 91.2% is attributable to the build-out of the 999 Bedford Street, Stamford location that will be used to provide branch operations and house multiple corporate departments currently located in leased space. Construction-in-process has also been impacted by the renovation and build-out of a new branch location in Westport, CT located at 50 Charles Street that accounts for $0.2 million or 8.0% of the increase. Management anticipates completing construction in the second quarter of 2017, at which time the properties will be placed into service.\nOther Real Estate Owned ( OREO\u201d)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, one property was foreclosed upon and is held as OREO at December 31, 2016. On taking possession of the property in 2016, the Bank recognized an approximate $11,000 gain that represents the fair value of the property in excess of the carrying value of the loan.\nDeferred Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2016, Patriot has available approximately $45.9 million of Federal net operating loss carryforwards ( NOL\u201d) that is offset by $30.6 million in \u00a7382 limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The $15.3 million of Federal NOLs are available to offset Patriot's taxable income for periods up to and through 2032, as these NOLs expire on various dates beginning in 2029.\nAdditionally, Patriot has approximately $64.8 million of NOLs available for Connecticut tax purposes, which may be used to offset up to 50% of taxable income in any year. The NOLs have an approximate fourteen year life.\nPatriot anticipates utilizing approximately $1.1 million of its tax-effected NOLs, in respect to its 2016 tax year.\nAs of December 31, 2016, Patriot had a $12.6 million deferred tax asset, comprised of multiple temporary differences, in addition to the previously aforementioned NOLs, which management believes will be fully realized in the future. The assessment of the potential relizability of the deferred tax assets is based on observation of the condition and future of the Bank, including:\n \u25cf Favorable financial performance over the past three years; \n \u25cf Forecasted taxable income for 2017 and future periods; \n \u25cf The growth in loan originations and the overall quality of the loan portfolio; \n \u25cf Improvements in operations and cost management; and \n \u25cf Net operating loss carry-forwards that do not begin to expire until 2029. \nThere is no guarantee that Patriot will realize the benefits of the NOLs in the future. As such, management continues to evaluate its ability to realize the benefits of the net deferred tax assets and will act accordingly if conditions change.\nDeposits\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, total deposits increased by $84.7 million or 19.0% from the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is substantially the result of a late third quarter and strong fourth quarter of 2016 effort by management to aggressively attract new depositors and strengthen the loyalty of the existing customer base by offering attractive interest rates compared to market. The effort is part of management's strategy to establish long-term relationships for sustained growth and profitability over short-term margins reflected in results. The long-term strategy is seen in the increase in interest expense on deposits of $0.2 million that is comparable to the $0.2 million decrease in advertising and marketing expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015.\nThe growth in deposits was virtually across all products offered by the Bank, except for non-interest bearing and money market accounts, which decreased by $9.0 million or 10.5% and $3.9 million or 20.1%, respectively from December 31, 2015. The decrease in non-interest bearing and money market accounts is emblematic of general market conditions and the rates of return offered by the financial services industry.\nGrowth in the all other deposit accounts may be summarized as:\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $33.6 million or 191.7% increase in Certificates of deposit that are greater than $250,000;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $25.1 million or 23.7% increase in Savings accounts;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $21.2 million or 15.2% increase in Certificates of deposit that are less than $250,000;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $15.7 million or 32.8% increase in Brokered deposits; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $2.0 million of 7.0% increase in NOW accounts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in deposits, most notably in the category of time certificates greater than $250,000 signifies the success of management in strengthening the Bank's liquidity by refocusing its operations on its customer base. The results of these efforts is easily viewed in comparison with the daily average balances that follow, which display a contrasting change in daily average balances of interest bearing deposits in virtually all categories.\nBorrowings\nPatriot's borrowings increased by approximately $17.5 million or 12.3% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. Borrowings consist primarily of FHLB advances, but also include senior notes, junior subordinated debentures, and a note payable to the seller from whom the Fairfield branch building was purchased in 2015.\nFHLB advances decreased by $9.0 million or 6.8% at December 31, 2016 compared to 2015, which decrease is primarily attributable to normal operations. The Bank maintains strong standing with the FHLB and its Well Capitalized\u201d designation with the FDIC, as provided below.\nIn December 2016, the Bank entered into a $16 million revolving line of credit agreement with a correspondent bank. The line of credit was obtained to provide short-term liquidity to satisfy overnight Fed account balance requirements and to provide for daily settlement of FRB, ACH, and other clearinghouse transactions. At December 31, 2016, $15.0 million was outstanding under the line of credit, which amount was repaid early in January 2017.\nIn December 2016, the Company issued $12 million of 7% senior unsecured notes in a private placement to accredited institutional investors. The notes mature in December 2021, require the payment of interest on a semi-annual basis, require interest-only through maturity, and are neither callable by the Company nor putable by the holders. The Company used approximately $7.2 million of the proceeds from the note issuance to bolster its investment in the Bank, which capital contribution qualifies for Tier 1 Capital of the Bank.\nShareholders' Equity\nIn July 2016, the Company authorized a one-year stock repurchase program whereby management may repurchase up to 500,000 shares of common stock through July 2017. The program authorizes management, at the direction of the Company's chairman, to repurchase shares on the open-market or in private transactions, in accordance with applicable security laws and regulations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, 72,471 shares of common stock were repurchased in a combination of open market and private transactions at an average cost of $14.04 per share or $1.0 million. The repurchased shares increased shares held in treasury from $0.2 million at December 31, 2015 to $1.2 million at December 31, 2016 or a 635.6% increase. Approximately 68,500 shares repurchased and entered into treasury relate to shares held by a former officer of the Company, which shares were repurchased at an average cost of $14.05. Management views the buy-back program as a valuable means to increase shareholder value through lowering the cost of capital and increasing the book value per share.\nAverage Balances\nThe following table presents daily average balance sheets, interest income, interest expense and the corresponding yields earned and rates paid for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
