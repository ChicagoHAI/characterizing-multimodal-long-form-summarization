( IZEA\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d or our\u201d) creates and operates online marketplaces that connect marketers, including brands, agencies, and publishers, with content creators such as bloggers and tweeters ( creators\u201d). Our technology brings the marketers and creators together, enabling their transactions to be completed at scale through the management of custom content workflow, creator search and targeting, bidding, analytics, and payment processing.\nWe help power the creator economy, allowing everyone from college students and stay-at-home individuals to celebrities and accredited journalists the opportunity to monetize their content, creativity and influence through our marketers. These creators are compensated by IZEA for producing unique content such as long and short form text, videos, photos, status updates, and illustrations for marketers or distributing such content on behalf of marketers through their personal websites, blogs, and social media channels.\nMarketers engage us to gain access to our industry expertise, technology, data, analytics, and network of creators. The majority of the marketers engage us to perform these services on their behalf, but they also have the ability to use our marketplaces on a self-service basis by licensing our technology. Our technology is used for two primary purposes: the engagement of creators for influencer marketing campaigns, or the engagement of creators to create stand-alone custom content for the marketers' own use and distribution. Marketers receive influential consumer content and engaging, shareable stories that drive awareness.\nOur primary technology platform, The IZEA Exchange ( IZEAx\u201d), enables transactions to be completed at scale through the management of custom content workflow, creator search and targeting, bidding, analytics, and payment processing. IZEAx is designed to provide a unified ecosystem that enables the creation and publication of multiple types of custom content through a creator's personal websites, blogs, or social media channels including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, among others. Until December 2019 when it was merged into IZEAx, we operated the Ebyline technology platform, which we acquired in January 2015. The Ebyline platform was originally designed as a self-service content marketplace to replace in-house editorial newsrooms in news agencies with a virtual newsroom\u201d to source and handle their content workflow with outside creators. After the acquisition, we began to utilize the creators in the Ebyline platform to produce professional custom content for brands, in addition to the self-service functionality used by newspapers. In July 2016, we acquired the ZenContent technology platform to use as an in-house workflow tool that enables us to produce highly scalable, multi-part production of content for both e-commerce entities and brand customers. The TapInfluence technology platform, acquired in 2018, performed in a similar manner to IZEAx and was being utilized by the majority of the TapInfluence customers as a self-service platform via a licensing arrangement, allowing access to the platform and its creators for self-managed marketing campaigns. After the migration of the last customers to IZEAx from the Ebyline platform in December 2019 and from the TapInfluence platform in February 2020, all marketplace revenue was solely generated from the IZEAx platform until the launch of Shake in November 2020.\nIn 2020, we launched two new platforms, BrandGraph and Shake. BrandGraph is a social media intelligence platform that is heavily integrated with IZEAx and both platforms rely heavily on data from each other, but it is also available as a stand-alone platform. The platform maps and classifies the complex hierarchy of corporation-to-brand relationships by category and associates social content with brands through a proprietary content analysis engine. Shake is a new online marketplace where buyers can quickly and easily hire creators of all types for influencer marketing, photography, design, and other digital services. The Shake platform is aimed at digital creatives seeking freelance gig\u201d work. Creators list available Shakes\u201d on their accounts in the platform and marketers select and purchase creative packages from them through a streamlined chat experience, assisted by ShakeBot - a proprietary, artificial intelligence assistant.\nImpact of COVID-19 on our Business\nOur operations, sales, and finances were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we took precautionary action and directed all staff to work from home effective March 16, 2020. During this work-from-home period, which is ongoing, the term of our leases for our headquarters and temporary office spaces expired. When and if we determine it prudent to end or modify our work-from-home policy, we may need to enter into a new lease for office space and/or arrangements for the use of co-working facilities.\nWhile we are able to maintain full operations remotely, the economic conditions caused by COVID-19 have negatively impacted the business activity of our customers. We observed changes in advertising decisions, timing, and spending priorities from brand and agency customers, which have resulted in a negative impact to our revenue.\nIn light of the adverse economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented certain cost-reduction measures for the three months ended June 30, 2020, including hiring restrictions and temporary salary and wage reductions. Salary reductions averaged 20%, including a 21% reduction in the base salary for our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer and in the fees of our directors. We also nearly eliminated travel expense for the remainder of 2020. In March 2020, we incurred debt by drawing on our secured credit facility and receiving a loan under the U.S. Small Business Association's Paycheck Protection Program. After we were able to secure additional capital through sales of our common stock through an at the market offering program in June 2020, the secured credit facility was paid down by June 30, 2020, and the employee salary reductions and hiring restrictions were removed effective July 1, 2020.\nIn an effort to contain COVID-19 or slow its spread, governments around the world have from time to time enacted various measures, including orders to close all businesses not deemed essential,\u201d isolate residents to their homes or places of residence, and practice social distancing when engaging in essential activities. These measures have impacted the method and timing of certain business meetings and our attendance at industry events. Rather than attending events in-person, as we have done historically, these events have been held virtually. We believe such events still are a valuable business opportunity, but their relative value without in-person networking is uncertain.\nWhen COVID-19 is demonstrably contained, we anticipate a rebound in economic activity, depending on the rate, pace, and effectiveness of the containment efforts deployed by various national, state, and local governments; however, the timing and extent of any such rebound is uncertain. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we began to see a dramatic year over year increase in Managed Services bookings, our net orders from customers, resulting in 48% growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. That growth in bookings led to a 10% growth in overall revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020. While we have seen a continuation of that positive momentum for Managed Services bookings in the first quarter of 2021, there is still risk that bookings will not be recognized as revenue if customers cancel prior to the performance of service.\nWe will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, employees, and prospects, or on our future financial results.\nKey Components of Results of Operations\nOverall consolidated results of operations are evaluated based on Revenue, Cost of Revenue, Sales and Marketing expenses, General and Administrative expenses, Depreciation and Amortization, and Other Income (Expense), net.\nRevenue\nWe historically generated revenue from five primary sources: (1) revenue from our managed services when a marketer (typically a brand, agency or partner) pays us to provide custom content, influencer marketing, amplification or other campaign management services ( Managed Services\u201d); (2) revenue from fees charged to software customers on their marketplace spend within our IZEAx, Shake, and TapInfluence platforms ( Marketplace Spend Fees\u201d); (3) revenue from fees charged to access the IZEAx, BrandGraph, Ebyline, and TapInfluence platforms ( License Fees\u201d); (4) revenue from transactions generated by the self-service use of our Ebyline platform for professional custom content workflow ( Legacy Workflow Fees\u201d); and (5) revenue derived from other fees such as inactivity fees, early cash-out fees, and subscription plan fees charged to users of our platforms ( Other Fees\u201d). After the migration of the last customers from the Ebyline platform to IZEAx in December 2019, there is no longer any revenue generated from Legacy Workflow Fees and all such revenue is reported as Marketplace Spend Fees under the IZEAx platform.\nAs discussed in more detail within Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\u201d under Note 1. Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d under Part I, Item 1 herein, revenue from Marketplace Spend Fees and Legacy Workflow Fees is reported on a net basis and revenue from all other sources, including Managed Services, License Fees, and Other Fees are reported on a gross basis. We further categorize these sources into two primary groups: (1) Managed Services and (2) SaaS Services, which includes revenue from Marketplace Spend Fees, License Fees, Legacy Workflow Fees, and Other Fees.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists of direct costs paid to our third-party creators who provide the custom content, influencer marketing or amplification services for our Managed Service customers where we report revenue on a gross basis. It also includes internal costs related to our campaign fulfillment and SaaS support departments. These costs include salaries, bonuses, commissions, stock-based compensation, employee benefit costs, and miscellaneous departmental costs related to the personnel who are primarily responsible for providing support to our customers and ultimately fulfillment of our obligations under our contracts with customers. Where appropriate, we capitalize costs that were incurred with software that is developed or acquired for our revenue supporting platforms and amortize these costs over the estimated useful lives of those platforms. This amortization is separately stated under depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of operations.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, bonuses, commissions, stock-based compensation, employee benefit costs, travel and miscellaneous departmental costs for our marketing, sales and sales support personnel, as well as marketing expenses such as brand marketing, public relation events, trade shows and marketing materials, and travel expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries, bonuses, commissions, stock-based compensation, employee benefit costs, and miscellaneous departmental costs related to our executive, finance, legal, human resources, and other administrative personnel. It also includes travel, public company and investor relations expenses, as well as accounting and legal professional services fees, leasehold facilities, and other corporate-related expenses. General and administrative expense also includes our technology and development costs consisting primarily of our payroll costs for our internal engineers and contractors responsible for developing, maintaining, and improving our technology, as well as hosting and software subscription costs. These costs are expensed as incurred, except to the extent that they are associated with internal use software that qualifies for capitalization, which are then recorded as software development costs in the consolidated balance sheet. We also capitalize costs that are related to our acquired intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization related to these costs are separately stated under depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of operations. General and administrative expense also includes current period gains and losses on our acquisition costs payable, as well as gains and losses from the sale of fixed assets. Impairments on fixed assets, intangible assets and goodwill, are included as part of general and administrative expense when they are not material and broken out separately in our consolidated statements of operations when they are material.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of amortization of our internal use software and acquired intangible assets from our business acquisitions. To a lesser extent, we also have depreciation and amortization on equipment and leasehold improvements used by our personnel. Costs are amortized or depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the associated assets.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Expense. Interest expense is mainly related to the imputed interest on our acquisition costs payable and interest when we use our secured credit facility.\nOther Income (Expense). Other income (expense) consists primarily of interest income for interest earned or changes in the value of our foreign assets and liabilities and foreign currency exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, primarily related to the Canadian Dollar.\nResults of Operations for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our

revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, increased 4% from the same period in 2019, primarily due to several customers completing larger fourth quarter projects based on their marketing objectives as compared to the prior year period.\nSaaS Services revenue is generated by the self-service use of our technology platforms by marketers to manage their own content workflow and influencer marketing campaigns. It consists of fees earned on the marketer's spend within the IZEAx, BrandGraph, TapInfluence, and Ebyline platforms, along with the license and support fees to access the platform services.\n\u2022Legacy Workflow Fees are no longer generated after the migration of the last customers from the Ebyline platform to IZEAx in December 2019. Any activity from former legacy workflow customers is now generated under the IZEAx platform and reported as Marketplace Spend Fees.\n\u2022Marketplace Spend Fees decreased by $648,629 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 when compared with the same period in 2019, primarily as a result of lower spend levels from our marketers and lower fees assessed on those spends as a result of competitive pricing efforts and the incorporation of lower margin legacy\nworkflow customers into IZEAx. Revenue from Marketplace Spend Fees represents our net margins received on this business. After the migration of the last customers from the TapInfluence platform to IZEAx in February 2020, all revenue was solely generated from the IZEAx platform until the launch of Shake in November 2020.\n\u2022License Fees revenue decreased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 to $1,507,336 compared to $1,986,285 in the same period of 2019. The decrease was partly due to former TapInfluence customers who churned during the second half of 2019. Additionally, we implemented a competitive standardized pricing system for all IZEAx license fee customers that was at a lower price point than the former TapInfluence licensing contracts.\n\u2022Other Fees revenue increased 94% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to increases in the number of subscriptions for certain new self-service offerings such as IZEAx Discovery and BrandGraph.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $521,315, or approximately 6%, compared to the same period in 2019 primarily as a result of the decrease in Managed Services revenue. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at 45% in 2019 and 44% in 2020.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $240,592, or approximately 4%, compared to the same period in 2019. Our payroll and personnel related expenses and stock compensation for sales and marketing personnel decreased $52,000 as a result of the cost reductions and operating changes implemented after the outbreak of COVID-19. Travel related expenses decreased by $176,000 due to the impact of COVID-19 restricting travel beginning in March 2020 and subscription based software expenses decreased by $10,000 due to the non-renewal of non-essential software as part of our operating changes.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $581,609, or approximately 6%, compared to the same period in 2019. General and administrative expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 decreased due to a $802,000 reduction in payroll and personnel related expenses as a result of a 13% decrease in the number of employees compared to the prior year period and the 20% average decrease in salaries that was implemented for the second quarter of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 cost reduction efforts. Rent expense also decreased by $370,000 due to the non-renewal of expiring office facility leases and travel costs decreased by $142,000 as our employees continue to work from home. These decreases were offset by an increase of $133,000 in contractor expenses as we began to increase the number of engineers working on our technology offerings. We also recorded a gain of $602,410 related to the settlement of our acquisition cost liabilities in 2019 that did not recur in 2020. The gain resulted due to the actual closing market price of our common stock on the date of settlement being lower than the 30-day volume weighted average price used to calculate the number of shares used to pay for the liability pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreements.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nIn March 2020, we identified triggering events due to the reduction in our projected revenue due to adverse economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the continuation of a market capitalization below our carrying value, and uncertainty for recovery given the volatility of the capital markets surrounding COVID-19. We performed an interim assessment of goodwill, using the discounted cash flow method under the income approach and the guideline transaction method under the market approach, and determined that the carrying value of our Company's reporting unit as of March 31, 2020 exceeded the fair value. As a result of the valuation, we recorded a $4.3 million impairment of goodwill resulting in an expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairment charges of $418,099 associated with our reduction in use of certain developed technology upon implementation of IZEAx 3.0 and the migration of TapInfluence customers and creators into the IZEAx platform.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $98,503, or approximately 6%, compared to the same period in 2019.\nDepreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $135,077 and $131,121 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Depreciation expense has increased slightly due to the purchase of new equipment in the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020.\nAmortization expense was $1,517,049 and $1,619,508 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the Ebyline, ZenContent, and TapInfluence acquisitions was $1,105,960 and $1,228,433 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, while amortization expense related to internal use software development costs was $411,089 and $391,075 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization on our intangible acquisition assets decreased in 2020 as several of these assets were fully amortized during 2020. Amortization on our internal use software increased due to the release of IZEAx 3.0 in April 2019.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest expense decreased by $170,642 to $63,012 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due primarily to the elimination of amounts owed on our acquisition costs payable and amortization thereon after July 2019 and partly to the reduction in our average borrowings on our secured credit facility during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.\nThe $64,530 decrease in other income during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019 resulted primarily from reduced interest income received on cash balances as short term interest rates declined to near zero in 2020 after the outbreak of COVID-19 and currency exchange losses on our Canadian transactions in 2020.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $10,250,007, a $2,959,887 increase in the net loss of $7,290,120 for the same period in 2019. The increase in net loss was primarily the result of the impairment on intangible assets discussed above offset by reductions in operating expenses.\nKey Metric\nWe review information provided by our key financial metric, gross billings, to assess the progress of our business and make decisions on where to allocate our resources. As our business evolves, we may make changes to the key financial metrics that we consider to measure our business in future periods.\nGross Billings by Revenue Type\nCompany management evaluates our operations and makes strategic decisions based, in part, on our key metric of gross billings from our two primary types of revenue, Managed Services and SaaS Services. We define gross billings as the total dollar value of the amounts charged to our customers for the services we perform and the amounts billed to our SaaS customers for their self-service purchase of goods and services on our platforms. The amounts billed to our SaaS customers are on a cost plus basis. Gross billings are the amounts of our reported revenue plus the cost of payments we made to third-party creators providing the content or sponsorship services, which are netted against revenue for generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) reporting purposes.\nGross billings for Managed Services are the same as revenue reported for those services in our consolidated statements of operations on a GAAP basis, as there is no requirement to net the costs of revenue against the revenue. Gross billings for SaaS Services differ from revenue reported for these services in our consolidated statements of operations on a GAAP basis, as revenue for these services are presented net of the amounts we collect and pay to the third-party creators providing the content or sponsorship services to the self-service SaaS customer.\nWe consider gross billings to be an important indicator of our potential performance as it measures the total dollar volume of transactions generated through our marketplaces. Tracking gross billings allows us to monitor the percentage of gross billings that we are able to retain after payments to our creators. Additionally, tracking gross billings is critical as it pertains to our credit risk and cash flow. We invoice our customers based on our services performed or based on their self-service transactions plus our fee. Then we remit the agreed-upon transaction price to the creators. If we do not collect the money from our customers prior to the time of payment to our creators, we could experience large swings in our cash flows. Finally, gross billings allow us to evaluate our transaction totals on an equal basis in order for us to see our contribution margins by revenue stream so that we can better understand where we should be allocating our resources.\nThe following tables set forth our gross billings by revenue type, the percentage of total gross billings by type, and the change between the periods:\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed Services Gross Billings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,987,226 </td> <td> </td> <td>66% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,432,868 </td> <td> </td> <td>53% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>554,358 </td> <td> </td> <td>4% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legacy Workflow Fees </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td>2,155,550 </td> <td> </td> <td>7% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,155,550) </td> <td> </td> <td>(100)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketplace Spend Fees </td> <td>6,476,261 </td> <td> </td> <td>27% </td> <td> </td> <td>9,264,892 </td> <td> </td> <td>32% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,788,631) </td> <td> </td> <td>(30)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License Fees </td> <td>1,507,336 </td> <td> </td> <td>6% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,986,285 </td> <td> </td> <td>7% </td> <td> </td> <td>(478,949) </td> <td> </td> <td>(24)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Fees </td> <td>213,062 </td> <td> </td> <td>1% </td> <td> </td> <td>109,840 </td> <td> </td> <td>1% </td> <td> </td> <td>103,222 </td> <td> </td> <td>94% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SaaS Services Gross Billings </td> <td>8,196,659 </td> <td> </td> <td>34% </td> <td> </td> <td>13,516,567 </td> <td> </td> <td>47% </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,319,908) </td> <td> </td> <td>(39)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Gross Billings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,183,885 </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,949,435 </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,765,550) </td> <td> </td> <td>(16)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure\u201d as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d). We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation, gain or loss on asset disposals or impairment, changes in acquisition cost estimates, and certain other unusual or non-cash income and expense items such as gains or losses on settlement of liabilities and exchanges, and changes in the fair value of derivatives, if applicable.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating performance, for planning purposes, to allocate resources to\nenhance the financial performance of our business, and in communications with our Board of Directors regarding our financial performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA also provides useful information to investors as it excludes transactions not related to our core cash-generating operating business activities, and it provides consistency to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that excluding these transactions allows investors to meaningfully trend and analyze the performance of our core cash-generating operations.\nAll companies do not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner, and Adjusted EBITDA as presented by us may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA presented by other companies, which limits its usefulness as a comparative measure. Moreover, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as under GAAP. These limitations are that Adjusted EBITDA:\n\u2022does not include stock-based compensation expense, which is a non-cash expense, but has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;\n\u2022does not include stock issued for payment of services, which is a non-cash expense, but has been, and is expected to be for the foreseeable future, an important means for us to compensate our directors, vendors and other parties who provide us with services;\n\u2022does not include changes in acquisition cost estimates as a result of the allocation of acquisition costs payable to compensation expense which may be a significant recurring expense for our business if we continue to make business acquisitions;\n\u2022does not include gains or losses on the settlement of acquisition costs payable or liabilities when the stock value, as agreed upon in the agreement, varies from the market price of our stock on the settlement date. This is a non-cash expense, but was a recurring expense for our business on certain business contracts where the amounts could vary;\n\u2022does not include depreciation and intangible assets amortization expense, impairment charges and gains or losses on disposal of equipment, which is not always a current period cash expense, but the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future; and\n\u2022does not include interest expense and other gains, losses, and expenses that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing core operating results, but these items may represent a reduction or increase in cash available to us.\nBecause of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the operation and growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements. In evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future, we may incur expenses similar to those for which adjustments are made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should also not be construed to infer that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation from the GAAP measurement of net loss to our non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10,250,007) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,290,120) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash stock-based compensation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>477,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>634,651 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash stock issued for payment of services </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141,665 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on settlement of acquisition costs payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(602,410) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in value of acquisition costs payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,222 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>233,654 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,652,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,750,629 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,300,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>418,099 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-cash items </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,598) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,786 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,654,474) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,688,824) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,329,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,955,672 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA as a % of Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(25) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $33,045,225 as of December 31, 2020 as compared to $5,884,629 as of December 31, 2019, an increase of $27,160,596, primarily due to net proceeds received from the sale of our common stock in our at the market offering program, offset by operating losses. We have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flow from operations for most periods since our inception, which has resulted in a total accumulated deficit of $70,634,776 as of December 31, 2020. To date, we have financed our operations through revenue from operations, borrowings under our secured credit facility, the PPP Loan (described below) and the sale of our equity securities.\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used for)/provided by: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,095,651) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,914,114) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td>(354,407) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(679,350) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td>29,610,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,509,690 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,160,596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,916,226 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash used for operating activities was $2,095,651 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and is primarily the result of continued use of cash to cover operating losses. Net cash used for investing activities was $354,407 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the payment of $363,793 in the development of our proprietary software. Net cash provided by financing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $29,610,654, which consisted primarily of net proceeds of approximately $27.7 million from the sale of our common stock in our at the market offering program and approximately $1.9 million from the PPP Loan (described below).\nSecured Credit Facility\nWe have a secured credit facility agreement with Western Alliance Bank, the parent company of Bridge Bank, National Association. Pursuant to this agreement, we may submit requests for funding up to 80% of our eligible accounts receivable up to a maximum credit limit of $5 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had no amounts outstanding under this agreement. Assuming that our unfunded remaining trade accounts receivable balance was eligible for funding, we had approximately $4.1 million in available credit under the agreement as of December 31, 2020.\nPPP Loan\nOn April 23, 2020, we received a loan from Western Alliance Bank (the Lender\u201d) in the principal amount of $1,905,100 (the PPP Loan\u201d) under the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d), which was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the SBA\u201d). The term of the promissory note (the Note\u201d) issued in respect of the loan is two years, though it may be payable sooner in connection with an event of default under the Note. The PPP Loan carries a fixed interest rate of one percent per year. Certain amounts received under the PPP Loan may be forgiven if the loan proceeds are used for eligible purposes, including payroll costs and certain rent or utility costs, and we meet other requirements regarding, among other things, the maintenance of employment and compensation levels. Loan payments on the PPP Loan may be deferred to either (1) the date that the SBA remits our loan forgiveness amount to the Lender or (2) ten months after the end of our loan forgiveness covered period, if we do not apply for loan forgiveness. We submitted our forgiveness application for the entire amount of the loan in December 2020 and, as of the date of this Annual Report, are awaiting approval from the SBA. The forgiveness of the PPP Loan is based on our adherence to the forgiveness criteria under the CARES Act, and no assurance is provided that we will obtain forgiveness of the PPP Loan in whole or in part.\nAt the Market (ATM) Offering\nOn June 4, 2020 and January 25, 2021, we entered into ATM Sales Agreements (as amended, the Sales Agreements\u201d) with National Securities Corporation, as sales agent ( National Securities\u201d), pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, through National Securities, shares of our common stock, by any method deemed to be an at the market offering\u201d as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ATM Offering\u201d), for aggregate purchase prices of up to $40,000,000 and $35,000,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had sold 14,819,740 shares at an average price of $1.92 per share for total gross proceeds of $28,455,096. From January 1, 2021 to March 26, 2021, we sold 8,691,391 shares at an average price of $3.95 per share for gross proceeds of $34,311,634. Thus, total proceeds raised in the ATM Offering under our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-238619) as of March 26, 2021 were $62,766,730.\nFinancial Condition\nWe have seen impacts on our operations due to changes in advertising decisions, timing and spending priorities from our customers as a result of COVID-19, which has had and may continue to have a negative impact to our expected future sales and valuation estimates. With our cash on hand as of December 31, 2020, we expect to have sufficient cash reserves and financing sources available to cover expenses at least one year from the issuance of this Annual Report based on our current estimates of revenue and expenses for the next twelve months. While the disruption caused by COVID-19 is currently expected to be temporary, it is generally outside of our control and there is uncertainty around the duration and the total economic impact. Therefore, this matter could have a further material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial position in future periods.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company did not engage in any off-balance sheet arrangements\u201d (as that term is defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) as of December 31, 2020.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). Certain of our accounting policies require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments will be subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Our judgments are based upon the historical experience of the Company, terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, please refer to Note 1 - Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We consider accounting estimates to be critical accounting policies when:\n\u2022The estimates involve matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made; and\n\u2022different estimates or changes to estimates could have a material impact on the reported financial position, changes in financial position, or results of operations.\nWhen more than one accounting principle, or method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that we consider to be the most appropriate when given the specific circumstances. Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties. Due to the inherent uncertainty involving estimates, actual results reported in the future may differ from our estimates. The following critical accounting policies are significantly affected by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements.\nAccounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk\nAccounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms. We consider an account to be delinquent when the customer has not paid its balance due by the associated due date. Uncollectibility of accounts receivable is not significant since most customers are bound by contract and are required to fund us for all the costs of an opportunity,\u201d defined as an order created by a marketer for a creator to develop or share content on behalf of a marketer. If a portion of the account balance is deemed uncollectible, we will either write-off the amount owed or provide a reserve based on our best estimate of the uncollectible portion of the account. Management estimates the collectibility of accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer's financial condition, credit history, and current economic conditions. We have a reserve of $155,000 for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2020. We believe that this estimate is reasonable, but there can be no assurance that the estimate will not change as a result of a change in economic conditions or business conditions within the industry, the individual customers or our Company. Any adjustments to this account are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as a general and administrative expense. Bad debt expense was less than 1% of revenue for each of the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nConcentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable were typically limited, because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up our customer base, thus spreading the trade credit risk. However, with our acquisition of TapInfluence, we have increased credit exposure on certain customers who carry significant credit balances related to their Marketplace Spend. We control credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits, and monitoring procedures.\nWe perform credit evaluations of our customers, but generally do not require collateral to support accounts receivable. We had no customer that accounted for more than 10% of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2020 and 2019. We had one customer that accounted for 12% of our revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and no customer that accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nSoftware Development Costs and Acquired Intangible Software\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 350-40, Internal Use Software, we capitalize certain internal use software development costs associated with creating and enhancing internally developed software related to our platforms. Software development activities generally consist of three stages (i) the research and planning stage, (ii) the application and development stage, and (iii) the post-implementation stage. Costs incurred in the research and planning stage and in the post-implementation stage of software development, or other maintenance and development expenses that do not meet the qualification for capitalization, are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred in the application and infrastructure development stage, including significant enhancements and upgrades, are capitalized. These costs include personnel and related employee benefits expenses for employees or consultants who are directly associated with and who devote time to software projects, and external direct costs of materials obtained in developing the software. We also capitalize certain costs associated with cloud computing arrangements (\"CCAs\"). We have capitalized software development costs of $3,036,810 in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. We also have additional proprietary software platforms valued at $820,000 from our acquisitions of Ebyline, ZenContent, and TapInfluence. These costs are reflected as intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. We do not transfer ownership of our software to third parties. These software development, acquired technology and CCA costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of five years upon initial release of the software or additional features. We review the software development costs for impairment when circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss for the excess of carrying value over the fair value in our consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill and Business Combinations\nGoodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred for an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets. We have goodwill in connection with our acquisitions of Ebyline, ZenContent, and TapInfluence. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead it is tested for impairment at least annually. In the event that management determines that the value of goodwill has become impaired, we will record a charge for the amount of impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made.\nWe perform our annual impairment tests of goodwill as of October 1 of each year, or more frequently, if certain indicators are present. For instance, in March 2020, we identified triggering events, including the reduction in our projected revenue due to adverse economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the continuation of a market capitalization below our carrying value, and uncertainty for recovery given the volatility of the capital markets surrounding COVID-19. Therefore, we performed an interim assessment of goodwill, using the discounted cash flow method under the income approach and the guideline transaction method under the market approach, and determined that the carrying value of our Company's reporting unit as of March 31, 2020 exceeded the fair value. As a result of the March 2020 valuation, we recorded a $4.3 million impairment of goodwill which is reflected as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nGoodwill is required to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below the operating segment level, which is referred to as a component. Management identifies its reporting units by assessing whether components (i) have discrete financial information available; (ii) engage in business activities; and (iii) whether a segment manager regularly reviews the component's operating results. Net assets and goodwill of acquired businesses are allocated to the reporting unit associated with the acquired business based on the anticipated organizational structure of the combined entities. If two or more components are deemed economically similar, those components are aggregated into one reporting unit when performing the annual goodwill impairment review. We have determined that we have one reporting unit.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe historically generated revenue from five primary sources: (1) revenue from our managed services when a marketer (typically a brand, agency or partner) pays us to provide custom content, influencer marketing, amplification or other campaign management services ( Managed Services\u201d); (2) revenue from fees charged to software customers on their marketplace spend\nwithin our IZEAx, Shake, and TapInfluence platforms ( Marketplace Spend Fees\u201d); (3) revenue from fees charged to access the IZEAx, BrandGraph, Ebyline, and TapInfluence platforms ( License Fees\u201d); (4) revenue from transactions generated by the self-service use of our Ebyline platform for professional custom content workflow ( Legacy Workflow Fees\u201d); and (5) revenue derived from other fees such as inactivity fees, early cash-out fees, and subscription plan fees charged to users of our platforms ( Other\u201d). After the migration of the last customers from the Ebyline platform to IZEAx in December 2019, there is no longer any revenue generated from Legacy Workflow Fees and all such revenue is reported as Marketplace Spend Fees under the IZEAx platform.\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d). Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized based on a five-step model as follows: (i) identify the contract with the customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied. The core principle of ASC 606 is that revenue is recognized when the transfer of promised goods or services to customers is made in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that it will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are distinct performance obligations. We also determine whether we act as an agent or a principal for each identified performance obligation. The determination of whether we act as the principal or the agent is highly subjective and requires us to evaluate a number of indicators individually and as a whole in order to make our determination. For transactions in which we act as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis as the amount paid by the marketer for the purchase of content or sponsorship, promotion and other related services and we record the amounts we pay to third-party creators as cost of revenue. For transactions in which we act as an agent, revenue is reported on a net basis as the amount we charged to the self-service marketer using our platforms, less the amounts paid to the third-party creators providing the service.\nWe maintain separate arrangements with each marketer and content creator either in the form of a master agreement or terms of service, which specify the terms of the relationship and access to its platforms, or by statement of work, which specifies the price and the services to be performed, along with other terms. The transaction price is determined based on the fixed fee stated in the statement of work and does not contain variable consideration. Marketers who contract with us to manage their advertising campaigns or custom content requests may prepay for services or request credit terms. Payment terms are typically 30 days from the invoice date. The agreement typically provides for either a non-refundable deposit, or a cancellation fee if the agreement is canceled by the customer prior to completion of services. Billings in advance of completed services are recorded as a contract liability until earned. We assess collectibility based on a number of factors, including the creditworthiness of the customer and payment and transaction history.\nManaged Services Revenue\nFor Managed Services Revenue, we enter into an agreement to provide services that may include multiple distinct performance obligations in the form of: (i) an integrated marketing campaign to provide influencer marketing services, which may include the provision of blogs, tweets, photos or videos shared through social network offerings and content promotion, such as click-through advertisements appearing in websites and social media channels; and (ii) custom content items, such as a research or news article, informational material or videos. Marketers typically purchase influencer marketing services for the purpose of providing public awareness or advertising buzz regarding the marketer's brand and they purchase custom content for internal and external use. We may provide one type or a combination of all types of these performance obligations on a statement of work for a lump sum fee. We allocate revenue to each performance obligation in the contract at inception based on its relative standalone selling price. These performance obligations are to be provided over a stated period that generally ranges from one day to one year. Revenue is accounted for when the performance obligation has been satisfied depending on the type of service provided. We view our obligation to deliver influencer marketing services, including management services, as a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time as the customer receives the benefits from the services. Revenue is recognized using an input method of costs incurred compared to total expected costs to measure the progress towards satisfying the overall performance obligation of the marketing campaign. The delivery of custom content represents a distinct performance obligation that is satisfied over time as we have no alternative for the custom content, and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date under the contracts. We consider custom content to be a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer, and revenue is recognized over time using an output method based on when each individual piece of content is delivered to the customer. Based on our evaluations, revenue from Managed Services is reported on a gross basis because we have the primary obligation to fulfill the performance obligations and we create, review, and control the services. We take on the risk of payment to any third-party creators, and we establish the contract price directly with our customers based on the services requested in the statement of work.\nMarketplace Spend Fees and Legacy Workflow Fees Revenue\nFor Marketplace Spend Fees and Legacy Workflow Fees Revenue, the self-service customer instructs creators found through the Company's platforms to provide and/or distribute custom content for an agreed upon transaction price. Our platforms control the contracting, description of services, acceptance of and payment for the requested content. This service is used primarily by news agencies or marketers to control the outsourcing of their content and advertising needs. We charge the self-service customer the transaction price plus a fee based on the contract. Revenue is recognized when the transaction is completed by the creator and accepted by the marketer or verified as posted by the system. Based on our evaluations, this revenue is reported on a net basis since we are acting as an agent solely arranging for the third-party creator or influencer to provide the services directly to the self-service customer through the platform or by posting the requested content.\nLicense Fees Revenue\nLicense Fees Revenue is generated through the granting of limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable licenses to customers for the use of the IZEAx, BrandGraph, and until February 2020, the TapInfluence technology platforms for an agreed-upon subscription period. Customers license the platforms to manage their own influencer marketing campaigns. Fees for subscription or licensing services are recognized straight-line over the term of the service.\nOther Fees Revenue\nOther Fees Revenue is generated when fees are charged to our platform users primarily related to monthly plan fees, inactivity fees, and early cash-out fees. Plan fees are recognized within the month they relate to, inactivity fees are recognized at a point in time when the account is deemed inactive, and early cash-out fees are recognized when a cash-out is either below certain minimum thresholds or when accelerated payout timing is requested.\nWe do not typically engage in contracts that are longer than one year. Therefore, we do not capitalize costs to obtain our customer contracts as these amounts generally would be recognized over a period of less than one year and are not material.\nChanges in how we control and manage our platforms, our contractual terms, our business practices, or other changes in accounting standards or interpretations, may change the reporting of our revenue.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the employee's requisite service period. We estimate the fair value of each stock option as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model. Options typically vest ratably over four years with one-fourth of options vesting one year from the date of grant and the remaining options vesting monthly, in equal increments over the remaining three-year period and generally have five or ten-year contract lives. We use the simplified method to estimate the expected term of employee stock options, because we do not believe historical exercise data will provide a reasonable basis for estimating the expected term for the current share options granted. The simplified method assumes that employees will exercise share options evenly between the period when the share options are vested and ending on the date when the options would expire.We use the closing stock price of our common stock on the date of the grant as the associated fair value of our common stock. For issuances after June 30, 2019, we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the volatility of our stock during the period. For issuances on or prior to June 30, 2019, we estimated the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the volatility of comparable peer companies that were publicly traded and had a longer trading history than us. We determine the expected life based on historical experience with similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and post-vesting forfeitures. We use the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury issues with an equivalent remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the award. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We estimate forfeitures when recognizing compensation expense and this estimate of forfeitures is adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized through a cumulative catch-up adjustment, which is recognized in the period of change, and a revised amount of unamortized compensation expense to be recognized in future periods.\nThe following table shows the number of stock options granted under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plans and the assumptions used to determine the fair value of those options during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Twelve Months Ended </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Options Granted </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average Exercise Price </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average Expected Term </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average Volatility </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average Risk-Free Interest Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Expected Dividends </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average\nGrant Date\nFair Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted average expected forfeiture rate </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>586,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.67 </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 years </td> <td> </td> <td>64.38% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.92% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.40 </td> <td> </td> <td>9.26% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>411,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.69 </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 years </td> <td> </td> <td>108.58% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.46% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.56 </td> <td> </td> <td>7.72% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal stock-based compensation expense recorded in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options, and employee stock purchase plan issuance during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $477,993 and $634,651, respectively.\nThere were outstanding options to purchase 1,712,806 shares with a weighted average exercise price of $2.56 per share, of which options to purchase 997,320 shares were exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $3.84 per share, as of December 31, 2020.

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCompany Overview\nIZEA Worldwide, Inc. ( IZEA\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d or our\u201d) creates and operates online marketplaces that connect marketers, including brands, agencies, and publishers, with content creators such as bloggers and tweeters ( creators\u201d). Our technology brings the marketers and creators together, enabling their transactions to be completed at scale through the management of custom content workflow, creator search and targeting, bidding, analytics, and payment processing.\nWe help power the creator economy, allowing everyone from college students and stay-at-home individuals to celebrities and accredited journalists the opportunity to monetize their content, creativity and influence through our marketers. These creators are compensated by IZEA for producing unique content such as long and short form text, videos, photos, status updates, and illustrations for marketers or distributing such content on behalf of marketers through their personal websites, blogs, and social media channels.\nMarketers engage us to gain access to our industry expertise, technology, data, analytics, and network of creators. The majority of the marketers engage us to perform these services on their behalf, but they also have the ability to use our marketplaces on a self-service basis by licensing our technology. Our technology is used for two primary purposes: the engagement of creators for influencer marketing campaigns, or the engagement of creators to create stand-alone custom content for the marketers' own use and distribution. Marketers receive influential consumer content and engaging, shareable stories that drive awareness.\nOur primary technology platform, The IZEA Exchange ( IZEAx\u201d), enables transactions to be completed at scale through the management of custom content workflow, creator search and targeting, bidding, analytics, and payment processing. IZEAx is designed to provide a unified ecosystem that enables the creation and publication of multiple types of custom content through a creator's personal websites, blogs, or social media channels including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, among others. Until December 2019 when it was merged into IZEAx, we operated the Ebyline technology platform, which we acquired in January 2015. The Ebyline platform was originally designed as a self-service content marketplace to replace in-house editorial newsrooms in news agencies with a virtual newsroom\u201d to source and handle their content workflow with outside creators. After the acquisition, we began to utilize the creators in the Ebyline platform to produce professional custom content for brands, in addition to the self-service functionality used by newspapers. In July 2016, we acquired the ZenContent technology platform to use as an in-house workflow tool that enables us to produce highly scalable, multi-part production of content for both e-commerce entities and brand customers. The TapInfluence technology platform, acquired in 2018, performed in a similar manner to IZEAx and was being utilized by the majority of the TapInfluence customers as a self-service platform via a licensing arrangement, allowing access to the platform and its creators for self-managed marketing campaigns. After the migration of the last customers to IZEAx from the Ebyline platform in December 2019 and from the TapInfluence platform in February 2020, all marketplace revenue was solely generated from the IZEAx platform until the launch of Shake in November 2020.\nIn 2020, we launched two new platforms, BrandGraph and Shake. BrandGraph is a social media intelligence platform that is heavily integrated with IZEAx and both platforms rely heavily on data from each other, but it is also available as a stand-alone platform. The platform maps and classifies the complex hierarchy of corporation-to-brand relationships by category and associates social content with brands through a proprietary content analysis engine. Shake is a new online marketplace where buyers can quickly and easily hire creators of all types for influencer marketing, photography, design, and other digital services. The Shake platform is aimed at digital creatives seeking freelance gig\u201d work. Creators list available Shakes\u201d on their accounts in the platform and marketers select and purchase creative packages from them through a streamlined chat experience, assisted by ShakeBot - a proprietary, artificial intelligence assistant.\nImpact of COVID-19 on our Business\nOur operations, sales, and finances were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we took precautionary action and directed all staff to work from home effective March 16, 2020. During this work-from-home period, which is ongoing, the term of our leases for our headquarters and temporary office spaces expired. When and if we determine it prudent to end or modify our work-from-home policy, we may need to enter into a new lease for office space and/or arrangements for the use of co-working facilities.\nWhile we are able to maintain full operations remotely, the economic conditions caused by COVID-19 have negatively impacted the business activity of our customers. We observed changes in advertising decisions, timing, and spending priorities from brand and agency customers, which have resulted in a negative impact to our revenue.\nIn light of the adverse economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented certain cost-reduction measures for the three months ended June 30, 2020, including hiring restrictions and temporary salary and wage reductions. Salary reductions averaged 20%, including a 21% reduction in the base salary for our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer and in the fees of our directors. We also nearly eliminated travel expense for the remainder of 2020. In March 2020, we incurred debt by drawing on our secured credit facility and receiving a loan under the U.S. Small Business Association's Paycheck Protection Program. After we were able to secure additional capital through sales of our common stock through an at the market offering program in June 2020, the secured credit facility was paid down by June 30, 2020, and the employee salary reductions and hiring restrictions were removed effective July 1, 2020.\nIn an effort to contain COVID-19 or slow its spread, governments around the world have from time to time enacted various measures, including orders to close all businesses not deemed essential,\u201d isolate residents to their homes or places of residence, and practice social distancing when engaging in essential activities. These measures have impacted the method and timing of certain business meetings and our attendance at industry events. Rather than attending events in-person, as we have done historically, these events have been held virtually. We believe such events still are a valuable business opportunity, but their relative value without in-person networking is uncertain.\nWhen COVID-19 is demonstrably contained, we anticipate a rebound in economic activity, depending on the rate, pace, and effectiveness of the containment efforts deployed by various national, state, and local governments; however, the timing and extent of any such rebound is uncertain. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we began to see a dramatic year over year increase in Managed Services bookings, our net orders from customers, resulting in 48% growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. That growth in bookings led to a 10% growth in overall revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020. While we have seen a continuation of that positive momentum for Managed Services bookings in the first quarter of 2021, there is still risk that bookings will not be recognized as revenue if customers cancel prior to the performance of service.\nWe will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, employees, and prospects, or on our future financial results.\nKey Components of Results of Operations\nOverall consolidated results of operations are evaluated based on Revenue, Cost of Revenue, Sales and Marketing expenses, General and Administrative expenses, Depreciation and Amortization, and Other Income (Expense), net.\nRevenue\nWe historically generated revenue from five primary sources: (1) revenue from our managed services when a marketer (typically a brand, agency or partner) pays us to provide custom content, influencer marketing, amplification or other campaign management services ( Managed Services\u201d); (2) revenue from fees charged to software customers on their marketplace spend within our IZEAx, Shake, and TapInfluence platforms ( Marketplace Spend Fees\u201d); (3) revenue from fees charged to access the IZEAx, BrandGraph, Ebyline, and TapInfluence platforms ( License Fees\u201d); (4) revenue from transactions generated by the self-service use of our Ebyline platform for professional custom content workflow ( Legacy Workflow Fees\u201d); and (5) revenue derived from other fees such as inactivity fees, early cash-out fees, and subscription plan fees charged to users of our platforms ( Other Fees\u201d). After the migration of the last customers from the Ebyline platform to IZEAx in December 2019, there is no longer any revenue generated from Legacy Workflow Fees and all such revenue is reported as Marketplace Spend Fees under the IZEAx platform.\nAs discussed in more detail within Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\u201d under Note 1. Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d under Part I, Item 1 herein, revenue from Marketplace Spend Fees and Legacy Workflow Fees is reported on a net basis and revenue from all other sources, including Managed Services, License Fees, and Other Fees are reported on a gross basis. We further categorize these sources into two primary groups: (1) Managed Services and (2) SaaS Services, which includes revenue from Marketplace Spend Fees, License Fees, Legacy Workflow Fees, and Other Fees.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists of direct costs paid to our third-party creators who provide the custom content, influencer marketing or amplification services for our Managed Service customers where we report revenue on a gross basis. It also includes internal costs related to our campaign fulfillment and SaaS support departments. These costs include salaries, bonuses, commissions, stock-based compensation, employee benefit costs, and miscellaneous departmental costs related to the personnel who are primarily responsible for providing support to our customers and ultimately fulfillment of our obligations under our contracts with customers. Where appropriate, we capitalize costs that were incurred with software that is developed or acquired for our revenue supporting platforms and amortize these costs over the estimated useful lives of those platforms. This amortization is separately stated under depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of operations.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, bonuses, commissions, stock-based compensation, employee benefit costs, travel and miscellaneous departmental costs for our marketing, sales and sales support personnel, as well as marketing expenses such as brand marketing, public relation events, trade shows and marketing materials, and travel expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries, bonuses, commissions, stock-based compensation, employee benefit costs, and miscellaneous departmental costs related to our executive, finance, legal, human resources, and other administrative personnel. It also includes travel, public company and investor relations expenses, as well as accounting and legal professional services fees, leasehold facilities, and other corporate-related expenses. General and administrative expense also includes our technology and development costs consisting primarily of our payroll costs for our internal engineers and contractors responsible for developing, maintaining, and improving our technology, as well as hosting and software subscription costs. These costs are expensed as incurred, except to the extent that they are associated with internal use software that qualifies for capitalization, which are then recorded as software development costs in the consolidated balance sheet. We also capitalize costs that are related to our acquired intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization related to these costs are separately stated under depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of operations. General and administrative expense also includes current period gains and losses on our acquisition costs payable, as well as gains and losses from the sale of fixed assets. Impairments on fixed assets, intangible assets and goodwill, are included as part of general and administrative expense when they are not material and broken out separately in our consolidated statements of operations when they are material.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of amortization of our internal use software and acquired intangible assets from our business acquisitions. To a lesser extent, we also have depreciation and amortization on equipment and leasehold improvements used by our personnel. Costs are amortized or depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the associated assets.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Expense. Interest expense is mainly related to the imputed interest on our acquisition costs payable and interest when we use our secured credit facility.\nOther Income (Expense). Other income (expense) consists primarily of interest income for interest earned or changes in the value of our foreign assets and liabilities and foreign currency exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, primarily related to the Canadian Dollar.\nResults of Operations for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated statements of operations and the change between the periods:\n\nRevenue\nThe following table illustrates our revenue by type, the percentage of total revenue by type, and the change between the periods:\n\nManaged Services revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, increased 4% from the same period in 2019, primarily due to several customers completing larger fourth quarter projects based on their marketing objectives as compared to the prior year period.\nSaaS Services revenue is generated by the self-service use of our technology platforms by marketers to manage their own content workflow and influencer marketing campaigns. It consists of fees earned on the marketer's spend within the IZEAx, BrandGraph, TapInfluence, and Ebyline platforms, along with the license and support fees to access the platform services.\n\u2022Legacy Workflow Fees are no longer generated after the migration of the last customers from the Ebyline platform to IZEAx in December 2019. Any activity from former legacy workflow customers is now generated under the IZEAx platform and reported as Marketplace Spend Fees.\n\u2022Marketplace Spend Fees decreased by $648,629 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 when compared with the same period in 2019, primarily as a result of lower spend levels from our marketers and lower fees assessed on those spends as a result of competitive pricing efforts and the incorporation of lower margin legacy\nworkflow customers into IZEAx. Revenue from Marketplace Spend Fees represents our net margins received on this business. After the migration of the last customers from the TapInfluence platform to IZEAx in February 2020, all revenue was solely generated from the IZEAx platform until the launch of Shake in November 2020.\n\u2022License Fees revenue decreased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 to $1,507,336 compared to $1,986,285 in the same period of 2019. The decrease was partly due to former TapInfluence customers who churned during the second half of 2019. Additionally, we implemented a competitive standardized pricing system for all IZEAx license fee customers that was at a lower price point than the former TapInfluence licensing contracts.\n\u2022Other Fees revenue increased 94% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to increases in the number of subscriptions for certain new self-service offerings such as IZEAx Discovery and BrandGraph.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $521,315, or approximately 6%, compared to the same period in 2019 primarily as a result of the decrease in Managed Services revenue. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at 45% in 2019 and 44% in 2020.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $240,592, or approximately 4%, compared to the same period in 2019. Our payroll and personnel related expenses and stock compensation for sales and marketing personnel decreased $52,000 as a result of the cost reductions and operating changes implemented after the outbreak of COVID-19. Travel related expenses decreased by $176,000 due to the impact of COVID-19 restricting travel beginning in March 2020 and subscription based software expenses decreased by $10,000 due to the non-renewal of non-essential software as part of our operating changes.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $581,609, or approximately 6%, compared to the same period in 2019. General and administrative expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 decreased due to a $802,000 reduction in payroll and personnel related expenses as a result of a 13% decrease in the number of employees compared to the prior year period and the 20% average decrease in salaries that was implemented for the second quarter of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 cost reduction efforts. Rent expense also decreased by $370,000 due to the non-renewal of expiring office facility leases and travel costs decreased by $142,000 as our employees continue to work from home. These decreases were offset by an increase of $133,000 in contractor expenses as we began to increase the number of engineers working on our technology offerings. We also recorded a gain of $602,410 related to the settlement of our acquisition cost liabilities in 2019 that did not recur in 2020. The gain resulted due to the actual closing market price of our common stock on the date of settlement being lower than the 30-day volume weighted average price used to calculate the number of shares used to pay for the liability pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreements.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nIn March 2020, we identified triggering events due to the reduction in our projected revenue due to adverse economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the continuation of a market capitalization below our carrying value, and uncertainty for recovery given the volatility of the capital markets surrounding COVID-19. We performed an interim assessment of goodwill, using the discounted cash flow method under the income approach and the guideline transaction method under the market approach, and determined that the carrying value of our Company's reporting unit as of March 31, 2020 exceeded the fair value. As a result of the valuation, we recorded a $4.3 million impairment of goodwill resulting in an expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairment charges of $418,099 associated with our reduction in use of certain developed technology upon implementation of IZEAx 3.0 and the migration of TapInfluence customers and creators into the IZEAx platform.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $98,503, or approximately 6%, compared to the same period in 2019.\nDepreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $135,077 and $131,121 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Depreciation expense has increased slightly due to the purchase of new equipment in the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020.\nAmortization expense was $1,517,049 and $1,619,508 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the Ebyline, ZenContent, and TapInfluence acquisitions was $1,105,960 and $1,228,433 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, while amortization expense related to internal use software development costs was $411,089 and $391,075 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization on our intangible acquisition assets decreased in 2020 as several of these assets were fully amortized during 2020. Amortization on our internal use software increased due to the release of IZEAx 3.0 in April 2019.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest expense decreased by $170,642 to $63,012 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due primarily to the elimination of amounts owed on our acquisition costs payable and amortization thereon after July 2019 and partly to the reduction in our average borrowings on our secured credit facility during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.\nThe $64,530 decrease in other income during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019 resulted primarily from reduced interest income received on cash balances as short term interest rates declined to near zero in 2020 after the outbreak of COVID-19 and currency exchange losses on our Canadian transactions in 2020.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $10,250,007, a $2,959,887 increase in the net loss of $7,290,120 for the same period in 2019. The increase in net loss was primarily the result of the impairment on intangible assets discussed above offset by reductions in operating expenses.\nKey Metric\nWe review information provided by our key financial metric, gross billings, to assess the progress of our business and make decisions on where to allocate our resources. As our business evolves, we may make changes to the key financial metrics that we consider to measure our business in future periods.\nGross Billings by Revenue Type\nCompany management evaluates our operations and makes strategic decisions based, in part, on our key metric of gross billings from our two primary types of revenue, Managed Services and SaaS Services. We define gross billings as the total dollar value of the amounts charged to our customers for the services we perform and the amounts billed to our SaaS customers for their self-service purchase of goods and services on our platforms. The amounts billed to our SaaS customers are on a cost plus basis. Gross billings are the amounts of our reported revenue plus the cost of payments we made to third-party creators providing the content or sponsorship services, which are netted against revenue for generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) reporting purposes.\nGross billings for Managed Services are the same as revenue reported for those services in our consolidated statements of operations on a GAAP basis, as there is no requirement to net the costs of revenue against the revenue. Gross billings for SaaS Services differ from revenue reported for these services in our consolidated statements of operations on a GAAP basis, as revenue for these services are presented net of the amounts we collect and pay to the third-party creators providing the content or sponsorship services to the self-service SaaS customer.\nWe consider gross billings to be an important indicator of our potential performance as it measures the total dollar volume of transactions generated through our marketplaces. Tracking gross billings allows us to monitor the percentage of gross billings that we are able to retain after payments to our creators. Additionally, tracking gross billings is critical as it pertains to our credit risk and cash flow. We invoice our customers based on our services performed or based on their self-service transactions plus our fee. Then we remit the agreed-upon transaction price to the creators. If we do not collect the money from our customers prior to the time of payment to our creators, we could experience large swings in our cash flows. Finally, gross billings allow us to evaluate our transaction totals on an equal basis in order for us to see our contribution margins by revenue stream so that we can better understand where we should be allocating our resources.\nThe following tables set forth our gross billings by revenue type, the percentage of total gross billings by type, and the change between the periods:\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure\u201d as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d). We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation, gain or loss on asset disposals or impairment, changes in acquisition cost estimates,", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCompany Overview\nIZEA Worldwide, Inc. ( IZEA\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d or our\u201d) creates and operates online marketplaces that connect marketers, including brands, agencies, and publishers, with content creators such as bloggers and tweeters ( creators\u201d). Our technology brings the marketers and creators together, enabling their transactions to be completed at scale through the management of custom content workflow, creator search and targeting, bidding, analytics, and payment processing.\nWe help power the creator economy, allowing everyone from college students and stay-at-home individuals to celebrities and accredited journalists the opportunity to monetize their content, creativity and influence through our marketers. These creators are compensated by IZEA for producing unique content such as long and short form text, videos, photos, status updates, and illustrations for marketers or distributing such content on behalf of marketers through their personal websites, blogs, and social media channels.\nMarketers engage us to gain access to our industry expertise, technology, data, analytics, and network of creators. The majority of the marketers engage us to perform these services on their behalf, but they also have the ability to use our marketplaces on a self-service basis by licensing our technology. Our technology is used for two primary purposes: the engagement of creators for influencer marketing campaigns, or the engagement of creators to create stand-alone custom content for the marketers' own use and distribution. Marketers receive influential consumer content and engaging, shareable stories that drive awareness.\nOur primary technology platform, The IZEA Exchange ( IZEAx\u201d), enables transactions to be completed at scale through the management of custom content workflow, creator search and targeting, bidding, analytics, and payment processing. IZEAx is designed to provide a unified ecosystem that enables the creation and publication of multiple types of custom content through a creator's personal websites, blogs, or social media channels including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, among others. Until December 2019 when it was merged into IZEAx, we operated the Ebyline technology platform, which we acquired in January 2015. The Ebyline platform was originally designed as a self-service content marketplace to replace in-house editorial newsrooms in news agencies with a virtual newsroom\u201d to source and handle their content workflow with outside creators. After the acquisition, we began to utilize the creators in the Ebyline platform to produce professional custom content for brands, in addition to the self-service functionality used by newspapers. In July 2016, we acquired the ZenContent technology platform to use as an in-house workflow tool that enables us to produce highly scalable, multi-part production of content for both e-commerce entities and brand customers. The TapInfluence technology platform, acquired in 2018, performed in a similar manner to IZEAx and was being utilized by the majority of the TapInfluence customers as a self-service platform via a licensing arrangement, allowing access to the platform and its creators for self-managed marketing campaigns. After the migration of the last customers to IZEAx from the Ebyline platform in December 2019 and from the TapInfluence platform in February 2020, all marketplace revenue was solely generated from the IZEAx platform until the launch of Shake in November 2020.\nIn 2020, we launched two new platforms, BrandGraph and Shake. BrandGraph is a social media intelligence platform that is heavily integrated with IZEAx and both platforms rely heavily on data from each other, but it is also available as a stand-alone platform. The platform maps and classifies the complex hierarchy of corporation-to-brand relationships by category and associates social content with brands through a proprietary content analysis engine. Shake is a new online marketplace where buyers can quickly and easily hire creators of all types for influencer marketing, photography, design, and other digital services. The Shake platform is aimed at digital creatives seeking freelance gig\u201d work. Creators list available Shakes\u201d on their accounts in the platform and marketers select and purchase creative packages from them through a streamlined chat experience, assisted by ShakeBot - a proprietary, artificial intelligence assistant.\nImpact of COVID-19 on our Business\nOur operations, sales, and finances were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we took precautionary action and directed all staff to work from home effective March 16, 2020. During this work-from-home period, which is ongoing, the term of our leases for our headquarters and temporary office spaces expired. When and if we determine it prudent to end or modify our work-from-home policy, we may need to enter into a new lease for office space and/or arrangements for the use of co-working facilities.\nWhile we are able to maintain full operations remotely, the economic conditions caused by COVID-19 have negatively impacted the business activity of our customers. We observed changes in advertising decisions, timing, and spending priorities from brand and agency customers, which have resulted in a negative impact to our revenue.\nIn light of the adverse economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented certain cost-reduction measures for the three months ended June 30, 2020, including hiring restrictions and temporary salary and wage reductions. Salary reductions averaged 20%, including a 21% reduction in the base salary for our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer and in the fees of our directors. We also nearly eliminated travel expense for the remainder of 2020. In March 2020, we incurred debt by drawing on our secured credit facility and receiving a loan under the U.S. Small Business Association's Paycheck Protection Program. After we were able to secure additional capital through sales of our common stock through an at the market offering program in June 2020, the secured credit facility was paid down by June 30, 2020, and the employee salary reductions and hiring restrictions were removed effective July 1, 2020.\nIn an effort to contain COVID-19 or slow its spread, governments around the world have from time to time enacted various measures, including orders to close all businesses not deemed essential,\u201d isolate residents to their homes or places of residence, and practice social distancing when engaging in essential activities. These measures have impacted the method and timing of certain business meetings and our attendance at industry events. Rather than attending events in-person, as we have done historically, these events have been held virtually. We believe such events still are a valuable business opportunity, but their relative value without in-person networking is uncertain.\nWhen COVID-19 is demonstrably contained, we anticipate a rebound in economic activity, depending on the rate, pace, and effectiveness of the containment efforts deployed by various national, state, and local governments; however, the timing and extent of any such rebound is uncertain. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we began to see a dramatic year over year increase in Managed Services bookings, our net orders from customers, resulting in 48% growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. That growth in bookings led to a 10% growth in overall revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020. While we have seen a continuation of that positive momentum for Managed Services bookings in the first quarter of 2021, there is still risk that bookings will not be recognized as revenue if customers cancel prior to the performance of service.\nWe will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, employees, and prospects, or on our future financial results.\nKey Components of Results of Operations\nOverall consolidated results of operations are evaluated based on Revenue, Cost of Revenue, Sales and Marketing expenses, General and Administrative expenses, Depreciation and Amortization, and Other Income (Expense), net.\nRevenue\nWe historically generated revenue from five primary sources: (1) revenue from our managed services when a marketer (typically a brand, agency or partner) pays us to provide custom content, influencer marketing, amplification or other campaign management services ( Managed Services\u201d); (2) revenue from fees charged to software customers on their marketplace spend within our IZEAx, Shake, and TapInfluence platforms ( Marketplace Spend Fees\u201d); (3) revenue from fees charged to access the IZEAx, BrandGraph, Ebyline, and TapInfluence platforms ( License Fees\u201d); (4) revenue from transactions generated by the self-service use of our Ebyline platform for professional custom content workflow ( Legacy Workflow Fees\u201d); and (5) revenue derived from other fees such as inactivity fees, early cash-out fees, and subscription plan fees charged to users of our platforms ( Other Fees\u201d). After the migration of the last customers from the Ebyline platform to IZEAx in December 2019, there is no longer any revenue generated from Legacy Workflow Fees and all such revenue is reported as Marketplace Spend Fees under the IZEAx platform.\nAs discussed in more detail within Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\u201d under Note 1. Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d under Part I, Item 1 herein, revenue from Marketplace Spend Fees and Legacy Workflow Fees is reported on a net basis and revenue from all other sources, including Managed Services, License Fees, and Other Fees are reported on a gross basis. We further categorize these sources into two primary groups: (1) Managed Services and (2) SaaS Services, which includes revenue from Marketplace Spend Fees, License Fees, Legacy Workflow Fees, and Other Fees.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists of direct costs paid to our third-party creators who provide the custom content, influencer marketing or amplification services for our Managed Service customers where we report revenue on a gross basis. It also includes internal costs related to our campaign fulfillment and SaaS support departments. These costs include salaries, bonuses, commissions, stock-based compensation, employee benefit costs, and miscellaneous departmental costs related to the personnel who are primarily responsible for providing support to our customers and ultimately fulfillment of our obligations under our contracts with customers. Where appropriate, we capitalize costs that were incurred with software that is developed or acquired for our revenue supporting platforms and amortize these costs over the estimated useful lives of those platforms. This amortization is separately stated under depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of operations.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, bonuses, commissions, stock-based compensation, employee benefit costs, travel and miscellaneous departmental costs for our marketing, sales and sales support personnel, as well as marketing expenses such as brand marketing, public relation events, trade shows and marketing materials, and travel expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries, bonuses, commissions, stock-based compensation, employee benefit costs, and miscellaneous departmental costs related to our executive, finance, legal, human resources, and other administrative personnel. It also includes travel, public company and investor relations expenses, as well as accounting and legal professional services fees, leasehold facilities, and other corporate-related expenses. General and administrative expense also includes our technology and development costs consisting primarily of our payroll costs for our internal engineers and contractors responsible for developing, maintaining, and improving our technology, as well as hosting and software subscription costs. These costs are expensed as incurred, except to the extent that they are associated with internal use software that qualifies for capitalization, which are then recorded as software development costs in the consolidated balance sheet. We also capitalize costs that are related to our acquired intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization related to these costs are separately stated under depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of operations. General and administrative expense also includes current period gains and losses on our acquisition costs payable, as well as gains and losses from the sale of fixed assets. Impairments on fixed assets, intangible assets and goodwill, are included as part of general and administrative expense when they are not material and broken out separately in our consolidated statements of operations when they are material.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of amortization of our internal use software and acquired intangible assets from our business acquisitions. To a lesser extent, we also have depreciation and amortization on equipment and leasehold improvements used by our personnel. Costs are amortized or depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the associated assets.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Expense. Interest expense is mainly related to the imputed interest on our acquisition costs payable and interest when we use our secured credit facility.\nOther Income (Expense). Other income (expense) consists primarily of interest income for interest earned or changes in the value of our foreign assets and liabilities and foreign currency exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, primarily related to the Canadian Dollar.\nResults of Operations for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our

revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, increased 4% from the same period in 2019, primarily due to several customers completing larger fourth quarter projects based on their marketing objectives as compared to the prior year period.\nSaaS Services revenue is generated by the self-service use of our technology platforms by marketers to manage their own content workflow and influencer marketing campaigns. It consists of fees earned on the marketer's spend within the IZEAx, BrandGraph, TapInfluence, and Ebyline platforms, along with the license and support fees to access the platform services.\n\u2022Legacy Workflow Fees are no longer generated after the migration of the last customers from the Ebyline platform to IZEAx in December 2019. Any activity from former legacy workflow customers is now generated under the IZEAx platform and reported as Marketplace Spend Fees.\n\u2022Marketplace Spend Fees decreased by $648,629 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 when compared with the same period in 2019, primarily as a result of lower spend levels from our marketers and lower fees assessed on those spends as a result of competitive pricing efforts and the incorporation of lower margin legacy\nworkflow customers into IZEAx. Revenue from Marketplace Spend Fees represents our net margins received on this business. After the migration of the last customers from the TapInfluence platform to IZEAx in February 2020, all revenue was solely generated from the IZEAx platform until the launch of Shake in November 2020.\n\u2022License Fees revenue decreased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 to $1,507,336 compared to $1,986,285 in the same period of 2019. The decrease was partly due to former TapInfluence customers who churned during the second half of 2019. Additionally, we implemented a competitive standardized pricing system for all IZEAx license fee customers that was at a lower price point than the former TapInfluence licensing contracts.\n\u2022Other Fees revenue increased 94% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to increases in the number of subscriptions for certain new self-service offerings such as IZEAx Discovery and BrandGraph.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $521,315, or approximately 6%, compared to the same period in 2019 primarily as a result of the decrease in Managed Services revenue. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at 45% in 2019 and 44% in 2020.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $240,592, or approximately 4%, compared to the same period in 2019. Our payroll and personnel related expenses and stock compensation for sales and marketing personnel decreased $52,000 as a result of the cost reductions and operating changes implemented after the outbreak of COVID-19. Travel related expenses decreased by $176,000 due to the impact of COVID-19 restricting travel beginning in March 2020 and subscription based software expenses decreased by $10,000 due to the non-renewal of non-essential software as part of our operating changes.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $581,609, or approximately 6%, compared to the same period in 2019. General and administrative expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 decreased due to a $802,000 reduction in payroll and personnel related expenses as a result of a 13% decrease in the number of employees compared to the prior year period and the 20% average decrease in salaries that was implemented for the second quarter of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 cost reduction efforts. Rent expense also decreased by $370,000 due to the non-renewal of expiring office facility leases and travel costs decreased by $142,000 as our employees continue to work from home. These decreases were offset by an increase of $133,000 in contractor expenses as we began to increase the number of engineers working on our technology offerings. We also recorded a gain of $602,410 related to the settlement of our acquisition cost liabilities in 2019 that did not recur in 2020. The gain resulted due to the actual closing market price of our common stock on the date of settlement being lower than the 30-day volume weighted average price used to calculate the number of shares used to pay for the liability pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreements.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nIn March 2020, we identified triggering events due to the reduction in our projected revenue due to adverse economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the continuation of a market capitalization below our carrying value, and uncertainty for recovery given the volatility of the capital markets surrounding COVID-19. We performed an interim assessment of goodwill, using the discounted cash flow method under the income approach and the guideline transaction method under the market approach, and determined that the carrying value of our Company's reporting unit as of March 31, 2020 exceeded the fair value. As a result of the valuation, we recorded a $4.3 million impairment of goodwill resulting in an expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairment charges of $418,099 associated with our reduction in use of certain developed technology upon implementation of IZEAx 3.0 and the migration of TapInfluence customers and creators into the IZEAx platform.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $98,503, or approximately 6%, compared to the same period in 2019.\nDepreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $135,077 and $131,121 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Depreciation expense has increased slightly due to the purchase of new equipment in the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020.\nAmortization expense was $1,517,049 and $1,619,508 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the Ebyline, ZenContent, and TapInfluence acquisitions was $1,105,960 and $1,228,433 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, while amortization expense related to internal use software development costs was $411,089 and $391,075 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization on our intangible acquisition assets decreased in 2020 as several of these assets were fully amortized during 2020. Amortization on our internal use software increased due to the release of IZEAx 3.0 in April 2019.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest expense decreased by $170,642 to $63,012 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due primarily to the elimination of amounts owed on our acquisition costs payable and amortization thereon after July 2019 and partly to the reduction in our average borrowings on our secured credit facility during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.\nThe $64,530 decrease in other income during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019 resulted primarily from reduced interest income received on cash balances as short term interest rates declined to near zero in 2020 after the outbreak of COVID-19 and currency exchange losses on our Canadian transactions in 2020.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $10,250,007, a $2,959,887 increase in the net loss of $7,290,120 for the same period in 2019. The increase in net loss was primarily the result of the impairment on intangible assets discussed above offset by reductions in operating expenses.\nKey Metric\nWe review information provided by our key financial metric, gross billings, to assess the progress of our business and make decisions on where to allocate our resources. As our business evolves, we may make changes to the key financial metrics that we consider to measure our business in future periods.\nGross Billings by Revenue Type\nCompany management evaluates our operations and makes strategic decisions based, in part, on our key metric of gross billings from our two primary types of revenue, Managed Services and SaaS Services. We define gross billings as the total dollar value of the amounts charged to our customers for the services we perform and the amounts billed to our SaaS customers for their self-service purchase of goods and services on our platforms. The amounts billed to our SaaS customers are on a cost plus basis. Gross billings are the amounts of our reported revenue plus the cost of payments we made to third-party creators providing the content or sponsorship services, which are netted against revenue for generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) reporting purposes.\nGross billings for Managed Services are the same as revenue reported for those services in our consolidated statements of operations on a GAAP basis, as there is no requirement to net the costs of revenue against the revenue. Gross billings for SaaS Services differ from revenue reported for these services in our consolidated statements of operations on a GAAP basis, as revenue for these services are presented net of the amounts we collect and pay to the third-party creators providing the content or sponsorship services to the self-service SaaS customer.\nWe consider gross billings to be an important indicator of our potential performance as it measures the total dollar volume of transactions generated through our marketplaces. Tracking gross billings allows us to monitor the percentage of gross billings that we are able to retain after payments to our creators. Additionally, tracking gross billings is critical as it pertains to our credit risk and cash flow. We invoice our customers based on our services performed or based on their self-service transactions plus our fee. Then we remit the agreed-upon transaction price to the creators. If we do not collect the money from our customers prior to the time of payment to our creators, we could experience large swings in our cash flows. Finally, gross billings allow us to evaluate our transaction totals on an equal basis in order for us to see our contribution margins by revenue stream so that we can better understand where we should be allocating our resources.\nThe following tables set forth our gross billings by revenue type, the percentage of total gross billings by type, and the change between the periods:\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed Services Gross Billings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,987,226 </td> <td> </td> <td>66% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,432,868 </td> <td> </td> <td>53% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>554,358 </td> <td> </td> <td>4% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legacy Workflow Fees </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td>2,155,550 </td> <td> </td> <td>7% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,155,550) </td> <td> </td> <td>(100)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketplace Spend Fees </td> <td>6,476,261 </td> <td> </td> <td>27% </td> <td> </td> <td>9,264,892 </td> <td> </td> <td>32% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,788,631) </td> <td> </td> <td>(30)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License Fees </td> <td>1,507,336 </td> <td> </td> <td>6% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,986,285 </td> <td> </td> <td>7% </td> <td> </td> <td>(478,949) </td> <td> </td> <td>(24)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Fees </td> <td>213,062 </td> <td> </td> <td>1% </td> <td> </td> <td>109,840 </td> <td> </td> <td>1% </td> <td> </td> <td>103,222 </td> <td> </td> <td>94% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SaaS Services Gross Billings </td> <td>8,196,659 </td> <td> </td> <td>34% </td> <td> </td> <td>13,516,567 </td> <td> </td> <td>47% </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,319,908) </td> <td> </td> <td>(39)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Gross Billings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,183,885 </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,949,435 </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,765,550) </td> <td> </td> <td>(16)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure\u201d as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d).
