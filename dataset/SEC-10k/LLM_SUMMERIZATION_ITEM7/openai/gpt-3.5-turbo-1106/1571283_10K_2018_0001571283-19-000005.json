Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors,\u201d Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Business\u201d and our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially\nfrom those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCompany Overview\nRexford Industrial Realty, Inc. is a self-administered and self-managed full-service REIT focused on owning and operating industrial properties in Southern California infill markets. We were formed as a Maryland corporation on January 18, 2013 and Rexford Industrial Realty, L.P. (the Operating Partnership\u201d), of which we are the sole general partner, was formed as a Maryland limited partnership on January 18, 2013. Through our controlling interest in our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, we own, manage, lease, acquire and develop industrial real estate primarily located in Southern California infill markets, and from time to time, acquire or provide mortgage debt secured by industrial property. We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT under the Code, and generally are not subject to federal taxes on our income to the extent we distribute our income to our shareholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our consolidated portfolio consisted of 176 properties with approximately 21.3 million rentable square feet. In addition, we currently manage an additional 20 properties with approximately 1.2 million rentable square feet.\nOur goal is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders by providing superior access to industrial property investments and mortgage debt secured by industrial property in Southern California infill markets. Our target markets provide us with opportunities to acquire both stabilized properties generating favorable cash flow, as well as properties where we can enhance returns through value-add renovations and redevelopment. Scarcity of available space and high barriers limiting new construction of for-lease product all contribute to create superior long-term supply/demand fundamentals within our target infill Southern California industrial property markets. With our vertically integrated platform and extensive value-add investment and management capabilities, we believe we are in a position to capitalize upon the opportunities in our markets to achieve our objectives.\nHighlights\nAcquisitions\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During 2018, we acquired 30 properties, with a combined 3.1 million rentable square feet, for an aggregate cost of $492.9 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Repositioning\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During 2018, we completed the repositioning of six of our properties located at 301-445 Figueroa Street, 28903 Avenue Paine, 14748-14750 Nelson Avenue, 15401 Figueroa Street, 2722 Fairview Street and 1580 Carson Street with a combined 0.6 million rentable square feet.

These high-barrier infill markets are characterized by a relative scarcity of available product, operating at near full occupancy, coupled with limited ability to introduce new supply due to high land and development costs and a dearth of developable land in markets experiencing a net reduction in supply as more industrial property is converted to non-industrial uses than can be delivered. Consequently, available industrial supply continues to decrease in many of our target infill submarkets, landlord concessions are at cyclically low levels and construction deliveries are falling short of demand. Meanwhile, underlying tenant demand within our infill target markets continues to demonstrate growth, illustrated or driven by strong re-leasing spreads, an expanding regional economy, substantial growth in e-commerce transaction and delivery volumes, as well as further compression of delivery time-frames to consumers and to businesses, increasing the significance of last-mile facilities for timely fulfillment. Despite potential concerns related to global growth, tax reform and changes to trade and tariff policies and the impact of rising interest rates, we continue to observe a number of positive trends within our target infill markets. Based on current observations within the infill Southern California industrial property market and within our property portfolio, we expect these positive trends may continue into the upcoming year.\nIn Los Angeles County, positive market trends continued through 2018, as historically high occupancy levels persisted year-over-year and asking lease rates increased significantly during 2018. Current market conditions indicate rents are likely to continue their upward trend with potential increases through 2019, as occupancy still remains at near capacity levels and new development is limited by a lack of land availability and an increase in land and development costs.\nIn Orange County, market fundamentals remained favorable throughout 2018. With steady tenant demand and a continued low availability of industrial product in this region, average asking lease rents continued their upward trend during 2018 and vacancy remained at historically low levels. Current regional market conditions indicate the potential for continued rental growth through 2019.\nIn San Diego, although there was a slight increase in vacancy year-over-year, net absorption was positive during 2018 and overall asking lease rates increased year-over-year.\nIn Ventura County, vacancy increased year-over-year and asking lease rates increased year-over year.\nLastly, in the Inland Empire, new industrial product continues to be absorbed well in the market. In the Inland Empire West, which contains infill markets in which we operate, vacancy remained at historically low levels and asking lease rates were unchanged year-over-year. We expect the outlook for the Inland Empire West to remain positive over the upcoming year. We generally do not focus on properties located within the non-infill Inland Empire East sub-market where the development and construction pipeline for new supply is substantial.\nAcquisitions and Value-Add Repositioning of Properties\nThe Company's growth strategy comprises acquiring leased, stabilized properties as well as properties with value-add opportunities to improve functionality and to deploy our value-driven asset management programs in order to increase cash flow and value. Additionally, from time to time, we may acquire land parcels or properties with excess land where we may construct new buildings, although we do not anticipate this to be a substantial part of our operations. Acquisitions may comprise single property investments as well as the purchase of portfolios of properties, with transaction values ranging from sub-$10 million dollar single-property investments to portfolios potentially valued in the billions of dollars. The Company's geographic focus remains infill Southern California. However, from time-to-time, portfolios could be acquired comprising a critical mass of infill Southern California industrial property that could include some assets located in markets outside of infill Southern California. In general, to the extent non-infill-Southern California assets were to be acquired as part of a larger portfolio, the Company may underwrite such investments with the potential to dispose such assets over a certain period of time in order to maximize its core focus on infill Southern California, while endeavoring to take appropriate steps to satisfy REIT safe harbor requirements to avoid prohibited transactions under REIT tax laws.\nA key component of our growth strategy is to acquire properties through off-market and lightly marketed transactions that are often operating at below-market occupancy or below-market rent at the time of acquisition or that have near-term lease roll-over or that provide opportunities to add value through functional or physical repositioning and improvements. Through\nvarious redevelopment, repositioning, and professional leasing and marketing strategies, we seek to increase the properties' functionality and attractiveness to prospective tenants and, over time, to stabilize the properties at occupancy rates that meet or exceed market rates.\nA repositioning may consist of a range of improvements to a property. These may include a complete structural renovation of a property whereby we convert large underutilized spaces into a series of smaller and more functional spaces, or it may include the creation of additional square footage, the modernization of the property site, the elimination of functional obsolescence, the addition or enhancement of loading areas and truck access, the enhancement of fire-life-safety systems or other accretive improvements. Because each repositioning effort is unique and determined based on the property, targeted tenants and overall trends in the general market and specific submarket, the timing and effect of the repositioning on our rental revenue and occupancy levels will vary, and, as a result, will affect the comparison of our results of operations from period to period with limited predictability.\nAs of December 31, 2018, seven of our properties were in various stages of repositioning or development and four of our properties were in the lease-up stage. In addition, we anticipate beginning repositioning work on two additional properties in early 2019. The table below sets forth a summary of these properties, as well as the four projects that were stabilized during 2018. In addition to the properties in the table below, we also have a range of smaller spaces in value-add repositioning or renovation, that due to their smaller size, are not presented below, however, in the aggregate, may be substantial.\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Construction Period(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property (Submarket)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Market\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Property Rentable Square Feet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Vacant Rentable Square Feet Under Repositioning/Lease-up\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Development Rentable Square Feet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Start\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Completion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Property Leased % at 12/31/18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current Repositioning:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>28903 Avenue Paine -

An increase in our repositioning and development activities resulting from value-add acquisitions could cause an increase in the asset balances qualifying for interest, insurance and tax capitalization in future periods. We capitalized $2.1 million of interest expense and $0.9 million of insurance and real estate tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2018, related to our repositioning and redevelopment projects.\nRental Revenue\nOur operating results depend primarily upon generating rental revenue from the properties in our consolidated portfolio. The amount of rental revenue generated by these properties is affected by our ability to maintain or increase occupancy levels and rental rates at our properties, which will depend upon our ability to lease vacant space and re-lease expiring space at favorable rates.\nOccupancy Rates\nAs of December 31, 2018, our consolidated portfolio was 95.4% occupied. We believe the opportunity to increase occupancy at our properties will be an important driver of future revenue growth. An opportunity to drive this growth will derive from the lease-up of recently completed repositioning projects and the completion and lease-up of repositioning projects that are currently under construction and planned for near-term construction.\nAs summarized in the table above, as of December 31, 2018, 11 of our properties with a combined 0.5 million vacant rentable square feet, were in various stages of repositioning or lease-up. These 11 properties are concentrated in our Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego and Ventura markets, and represent 2.2% of our total consolidated portfolio square footage as of December 31, 2018. Including vacant repositioning and lease-up space at these 11 properties, our weighted average occupancy rate as of December 31, 2018, in Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego and Ventura was 96.1%, 95.1%, 95.2% and 88.6%, respectively. Excluding vacant repositioning and lease-up space at these 11 properties, our weighted average occupancy rate as of December 31, 2018, in these markets was 97.8%, 97.2%, 97.4% and 97.2%, respectively, and our overall portfolio occupancy excluding these properties was 97.5%. We believe that a significant portion of our long-term future growth will come from the completion of these projects currently under or scheduled for repositioning, as well as through the identification or acquisition of new opportunities for redevelopment and repositioning, whether in our existing portfolio or through new investments, which may vary from period to period subject to market conditions.\nThe occupancy rate of properties not undergoing repositioning is affected by regional and local economic conditions in our Southern California infill markets. Throughout 2018, the Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego county markets have continued to show historically low vacancy and positive absorption, resulting from high tenant demand combined with low product availability. Accordingly, our properties in these markets have exhibited a similar trend. We expect general market conditions to remain positive in 2019, and we believe the opportunity to increase occupancy and rental rates at our properties will be an important driver of future revenue growth.\nLeasing Activity and Rental Rates\nThe following tables set forth our leasing activity for new and renewal leases on a quarterly basis for the year ended December 31, 2018:\nTable 200:

While we reposition a property, its space may become unavailable for leasing until completion of our repositioning efforts. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we stabilized 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard - Unit H, 301-445 Figueroa Street and\n28903 Avenue Paine with a combined 289,512 rentable square feet and leased an additional 172,890 rentable square feet at 14748-14750 Nelson Avenue. Additionally, in January 2019 we completed and stabilized our development property located at 1998 Surveyor Avenue. As of the date of this filing, we have six incomplete repositioning and development projects with estimated construction completion periods ranging from the second quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of 2021 and four properties in the lease-up stage. We expect these properties to have positive impacts on our leasing activity and revenue generation as we complete our value-add repositioning plan and place these properties in service.\nScheduled Lease Expirations\nOur ability to re-lease space subject to expiring leases is affected by economic and competitive conditions in our markets and by the desirability of our individual properties, which may impact our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, 0.7 million rentable square feet of our portfolio was available for lease, 0.3 million rentable square feet of vacant space was under repositioning and leases representing 0.2 million rentable square feet of our portfolio expired on December 31, 2018. Additionally, leases representing 12.9% and 19.6% of the aggregate rentable square footage of our portfolio are scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we renewed 246 leases for 1.9 million rentable square feet, resulting in a 65.4% retention rate. Our retention rate during the year was impacted by our strategy to roll certain tenants at below-market rents and to replace them with higher quality tenants paying higher rents with minimal down time. New and renewal leases signed during the current year had a weighted average term of 4.8 and 3.5 years, respectively, and we expect future new and renewal leases to have similar terms.\nThe leases scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2020, represent 13.7% and 19.6%, respectively, of the total annualized base rent for our portfolio as of December 31, 2018. We estimate that, on a weighted average basis, in-place rents of leases scheduled to expire in 2019 and 2020 are currently below current market asking rents, although individual units or properties within any particular submarket presently may be leased either above, below, or at the current market asking rates within that submarket. As described in the above Market Fundamentals section, we expect market dynamics to remain strong heading into 2019 and that these positive trends will provide a favorable environment for additional increases in lease renewal rates. Accordingly, we expect 2019 will show positive renewal rates and leasing spreads. We also currently do not see any reason not to expect that 2020 lease expirations will show positive growth upon renewal; however, it is difficult to predict market conditions that far into the future.\nConditions in Our Markets\nThe properties in our portfolio are located primarily in Southern California infill markets. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in this market may affect our overall performance.\nProperty Expenses\nOur rental expenses generally consist of utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, site repair and maintenance costs, and the allocation of overhead costs. For the majority of our properties, our property expenses are recovered, in part, by either the triple net provisions or modified gross expense reimbursements in tenant leases. The majority of our leases also comprise contractual three percent annual rental rate increases meant, in part, to help mitigate potential increases in property expenses over time. However, the terms of our leases vary and, in some instances, we may absorb property expenses. Our overall financial results will be impacted by the extent to which we are able to pass-through property expenses to our tenants.\nTaxable REIT Subsidiary\nAs of December 31, 2018, our Operating Partnership indirectly and wholly owns Rexford Industrial Realty and Management, Inc., which we refer to as the services company. We have elected, together with our services company, to treat our services company as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary generally may provide non-customary and other services to our tenants and engage in activities that we may not engage in directly without adversely affecting our qualification as a REIT, provided a taxable REIT subsidiary may not operate or manage a lodging facility or health care facility or provide rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated. We may form additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future, and our Operating Partnership may contribute some or all of its interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries or their assets to our services company. Any income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not be included in our taxable income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, except to the extent such income is distributed to us as a dividend, in which case such dividend income will qualify under the 95%, but not the 75%, gross income test. Because a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal income tax, and state and local income tax (where applicable) as a regular corporation, the income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries generally will be subject to an additional level of tax as compared to the income earned by our other subsidiaries. Our taxable REIT subsidiary is a C-corporation subject to federal and\nstate income tax, however it has a cumulative unrecognized net operation loss carryforward and therefore there is no income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We have summarized below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on financial condition and results of operations. Management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon information currently available and on various assumptions that it believes are reasonable as of the date hereof. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those of other companies.\nA critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity's financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management. Generally, the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by the users of our financial statements in their evaluation of our performance.\nThe following critical accounting policies discussion reflects what we believe are the most significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion of our significant accounting policies and discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 of this report on Form 10-K.\nInvestment in Real Estate\nAcquisitions\nEffective January 1, 2017, we adopted ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations - Clarifying the Definition of a Business ( ASU 2017-01'), which provides a framework for determining whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. Under ASU 2017-01, when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar assets, the set of assets and activities is not a business. ASU 2017-01 also revises the definition of a business to include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create an output.\nWe evaluate each of our property acquisitions to determine whether the acquired set of assets and activities (collectively referred to as a set\u201d) meets the definition of a business and will need to be accounted for as a business combination. A set would fail to qualify as a business if either (i) substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in either a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets or (ii) the set is lacking, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. An acquired process is considered substantive if (i) the process includes an organized workforce (or includes an acquired contract that provides access to an organized workforce), that is skilled, knowledgeable, and experienced in performing the process, (ii) the process cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay or (iii) the process is considered unique or scarce.\nWe evaluated the acquisitions that we completed during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and determined that under this framework these transactions should be accounted for as asset acquisitions. We expect that most of our property acquisitions will generally not meet the revised definition of a business because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets or because the acquisition does not include a substantive process.\nFor acquisitions that are accounted for as asset acquisitions, because they do not meet the business combination accounting criteria, we allocate the cost of the acquisition, which includes the purchase price and associated acquisition transaction costs, to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. These individual assets and liabilities typically include land, building and improvements, tenant improvements, intangible assets and liabilities related to above and below market leases, intangible assets related to in-place leases, and from time to time, assumed debt. As there is no measurement period concept for an asset acquisition, the allocated cost of the acquired assets is finalized in the period in which the acquisition occurs.\nWe determine the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property by valuing the property as if it were vacant. This as-if vacant\u201d value is estimated using an income, or discounted cash flow, approach that relies upon Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs based on the Company's assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use. These Level 3 inputs include discount rates, capitalization rates, market rents and comparable sales data for similar properties. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. In calculating the as-if-vacant\u201d value for acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2018, we used discount rates ranging from 5.50% and 7.50% and capitalization rates ranging from 4.25% to 6.25%.\nIn determining the fair value of intangible lease assets or liabilities, we also consider Level 3 inputs. Acquired above- and below-market leases are valued based on the present value of the difference between prevailing market rates and the in-place rates measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases, if applicable. The estimated fair value of acquired in-place at-market tenant leases are the costs that would have been incurred to lease the property to the occupancy level of the property at the date of acquisition. Such estimates include the value associated with leasing commissions, legal and other costs, as well as the estimated period necessary to lease such property to its occupancy level at the time of its acquisition. In determining the fair value of acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2018, we used an estimated average lease-up period ranging from six to twelve months.\nThe difference between the fair value and the face value of debt assumed in connection with an acquisition is recorded as a premium or discount and amortized to interest expense\u201d over the life of the debt assumed. The valuation of assumed liabilities is based on our estimate of the current market rates for similar liabilities in effect at the acquisition date.\nCapitalization of Costs\nWe capitalize direct costs incurred in developing, renovating, rehabilitating and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis. This includes certain general and administrative costs, including payroll, bonus, and non-cash equity compensation of the personnel performing development, renovations and rehabilitation if such costs are identifiable to a specific activity to get the real estate asset ready for its intended use. During the development and construction periods of a project, we also capitalize interest, real estate taxes and insurance costs. We cease capitalization of costs upon substantial completion of the project, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. If some portions of a project are substantially complete and ready for use and other portions have not yet reached that stage, we cease capitalizing costs on the completed portion of the project but continue to capitalize for the incomplete portion of the project. Costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred.\nWe capitalized interest costs of $2.1 million, $1.7 million and $1.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We capitalized real estate taxes and insurance aggregating $0.9 million, $1.2 million and $0.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We capitalized compensation costs for employees who provide construction services of $2.2 million, $1.9 million and $1.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets Subsections of ASC Topic 360: Property, Plant, and Equipment, we assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets, including goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.\nRecoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. To review real estate assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. The intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions and other factors change. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, applying a capitalization rate to estimated net operating income of a property, quoted market values and third party appraisals, where considered necessary. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan used to manage our underlying business. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we will recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property.\nAssumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with respect to our investment that occur subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our real estate properties.\nRevenue Recognition\nRental Income\nMinimum annual rental revenues are recognized in rental income on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease, regardless of when payments are contractually due. Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession or controls the physical use of the leased space. Lease termination fees, which are included in rental income, are amortized over the remaining term of the lease until we have no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenant.\nTenant Reimbursements\nOur lease agreements with tenants generally contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse us for certain property expenses. Estimated reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period that the recoverable expenses are incurred. Subsequent to year-end, we perform final reconciliations on a lease-by-lease basis and bill or credit each tenant for any cumulative annual adjustments.\nOther Income\nOther income primarily consists of late payment fees and other miscellaneous tenant related revenues.\nManagement, leasing and development services\nWe provide property management services and leasing services to related party and third-party property owners, the customer, in exchange for fees and commissions. Property management services include performing property inspections, monitoring repairs and maintenance, negotiating vendor contracts, maintaining tenant relations and providing financial and accounting oversight. For these services, we earn monthly management fees, which are based on a fixed percentage of each managed property's monthly tenant cash receipts. We have determined that control over the services is passed to the customer simultaneously as performance occurs. Accordingly, management fee revenue is earned as the services are provided to our customers.\nLeasing commissions are earned when we provide leasing services that result in an executed lease with a tenant. We have determined that control over the services is transferred to the customer upon execution of each lease agreement. We earn leasing commissions based on a fixed percentage of rental income generated for each executed lease agreement and there is no variable income component.\nGain or Loss on Sale of Real Estate\nWe account for dispositions of real estate properties, which are considered nonfinancial assets, in accordance with ASC 610-20: Other Income-Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets and recognize a gain or loss on sale of real estate upon transferring control of the nonfinancial asset to the purchaser, which is generally satisfied at the time of sale. If we were to conduct a partial sale of real estate by transferring a controlling interest in a nonfinancial asset, while retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest, we would measure any noncontrolling interest received or retained at fair value, and recognize a full gain or loss. If we receive consideration before transferring control of a nonfinancial asset, we recognize a contract liability. If we transfer control of the asset before consideration is received, we recognize a contract asset.\nValuation of Receivables\nWe may be subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables. In order to mitigate these risks, we perform credit reviews and analyses on prospective tenants before significant leases are executed and on existing tenants before properties are acquired. We specifically analyze aged receivables, customer credit-worthiness, historical bad debts and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. As a result of our periodic analysis, we maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make required payments. This estimate requires significant judgment related to the lessees' ability to fulfill their obligations under the leases. We believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate for our outstanding receivables for the periods presented. If a tenant is insolvent or files for bankruptcy protection and fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the net outstanding balances, which include amounts recognized as straight-line revenue not realizable until future periods.\nResults of Operations\nOur consolidated results of operations are often not comparable from period to period due to the effect of property acquisitions and dispositions completed during the comparative reporting periods. Our Total Portfolio\u201d represents all of the properties owned during the reported periods. To eliminate the effect of changes in our Total Portfolio due to acquisitions and dispositions and to highlight the operating results of our on-going business, we have separately presented the results of our Same Properties Portfolio.\u201d\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our Same Properties Portfolio includes all properties in our industrial portfolio that were wholly-owned by us as of January 1, 2017, and still owned by us as of December 31, 2018, which consisted of 126 properties aggregating approximately 14.1 million rentable square feet.

Portfolio rental revenue increased by $10.5 million, or 9.0%, and $41.4 million, or 30.4%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio rental income is primarily due to the increase in the weighted average occupancy of the portfolio for comparable periods, which was driven by the completion of repositioning and development work and subsequent lease-up of space at nine of these properties during 2017 and 2018, as well as the increase in average rental rates on new and renewal leases. Our Total Portfolio rental revenue was also positively impacted by the incremental revenues from the 51 properties we acquired during 2017 and 2018, partially offset by the decrease in revenues from the 12 properties that were sold during 2017 and 2018.\nTenant Reimbursements\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements revenue increased by $1.8 million, or 9.0%, and $8.8 million or 37.8%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio tenant reimbursements is primarily due to an increase in recoverable operating expenses for comparable periods, an increase in the weighted average occupancy of the portfolio for comparable periods, which was driven by the completion of repositioning and development work and subsequent lease-up of space at nine of these properties during 2017 and 2018. Our Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements revenue was also impacted by the incremental reimbursements from the 51 properties we acquired during 2017 and 2018, partially offset by the decrease in reimbursements from the 12 properties that were sold during 2017 and 2018.\nOther Income\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio other income increased by $2 thousand, or 0.3%, and $11 thousand, or 1.3%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio other income is primarily due to an increase in tenant legal fee reimbursement income and late fee income, partially offset by a decrease in other miscellaneous income.\nManagement, Leasing and Development Services\nOur Total Portfolio management, leasing and development services revenue decreased by $20 thousand, or 4.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nInterest Income\nOur Total Portfolio interest income increased by $0.9 million, or 209.7%, during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Interest income of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, was earned from the investment of excess cash in money market accounts. Interest income of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, relates to a $6.0 million mortgage loan that we made on July 1, 2016, which was subsequently repaid on June 23, 2017. The loan was secured by an industrial property located in Rancho Cucamonga, California and bore interest at 10.0% per annum.\nProperty Expenses\nOur Same Properties Portfolio property expenses increased by $1.4 million or 4.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio property expenses is primarily due to an increase in real estate tax expense, which is partially due to a decrease in capitalized real estate taxes resulting from the completion of construction at certain of our repositioning properties. Our Total Portfolio property expenses increased by $9.5 million, or 22.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the incremental expenses from the 51 properties we acquired during 2017 and 2018, partially offset by the decrease in property expenses from the 12 properties that were sold during 2017 and 2018.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur Total Portfolio general and administrative expenses increased by $3.6 million, or 16.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is primarily due to an increase in non-cash equity compensation expense and accrued bonus expense for our named executive officers, an increase in other various corporate expenses, an increase in legal expense and an increase in professional audit and tax services expense.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nOur Same Properties Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $1.3 million, or 2.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to acquisition-related tenant improvements and in-place lease intangibles becoming fully depreciated during 2017 and 2018, partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense related to capital improvements placed into service during 2017 and 2018. Our Total Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense increased by $15.2 million, or 23.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to incremental expense from the 51 properties we acquired during 2017 and 2018, and an increase in depreciation expense related to capital improvements, partially offset by the decrease in our Same Properties Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense noted above.\nAcquisition Expenses\nOur Total Portfolio acquisition expenses decreased by $0.1 million, or 30.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the write-off of $0.3 million of transaction costs in connection with the termination of a ground lease in March 2017, partially offset by an increase in acquisition related costs incurred that did not result in completed transactions.\nInterest Expense\nOur Total Portfolio interest expense increased by $5.2 million, or 25.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense is primarily comprised of the following: (i) $3.4 million increase related to the $150.0 million term loan facility borrowing we made in May 2018 and (ii) a $2.6 million increase related to the issuance of $125.0 million of 3.93% fixed rate senior notes in July 2017. These increases were partially offset by the following: (i) a $0.4 million increase in capitalized interest related to our repositioning and redevelopment properties and (ii) a $0.4 million decrease in interest related to a reduction of outstanding borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nEquity in Income from Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities\nEquity in income from unconsolidated real estate entities of $11 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017, represents the final liquidating distribution we received in connection with the winding down of our joint venture.\nGain on Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we repaid the 1065 Walnut Street mortgage loan and the 12907 Imperial Highway mortgage loan. The gain on extinguishment of debt of $25 thousand represents the write-off of $0.2 million of unamortized loan premiums, partially offset by the $0.2 million penalty incurred for repaying the 1065 Walnut Street mortgage loan in advance of the maturity date.\nGain on Sale of Real Estate\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a total gain of $17.2 million from the disposition of six properties that were sold for an aggregate gross sales price of $48.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a total gain of $29.6 million from the disposition of six properties that were sold for an aggregate gross sales price of $98.7 million.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2017 to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nFor the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our Same Properties Portfolio includes all properties in our industrial portfolio that were wholly-owned by us as of January 1, 2016, and still owned by us as of December 31, 2017, which consisted of 111 properties aggregating approximately 11.0 million rentable square feet. Results for our Same Properties Portfolio exclude our joint venture property, any properties that were acquired or sold during 2017 and 2016, interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses. For the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our Total Portfolio includes the properties in our Same Properties Portfolio, the 41 properties aggregating approximately 7.6 million rentable square feet that were acquired during 2017 and 2016, and the 11 properties aggregating approximately 1.1 million rentable square feet that were sold during 2017 and 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our Same Properties Portfolio occupancy was approximately 98.0% and 96.2%, respectively.

Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio rental revenue increased by $7.1 million, or 7.7%, and $28.6 million, or 26.6%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio rental income is primarily due to the increase in the weighted average occupancy of the portfolio for comparable periods, which was driven by the completion of repositioning work and subsequent lease-up of space at nine of our properties during 2016 and 2017, as well as the increase in average rental rates on new and renewal leases. Our Total Portfolio rental revenue was also positively impacted by the incremental revenues from the 41 properties we acquired during 2016 and 2017, partially offset by the decrease in revenues from the 11 properties that were sold during 2016 and 2017.\nTenant Reimbursements\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements revenue increased $1.6 million, or 11.4%, and increased $6.6 million or 39.7%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio tenant reimbursements is primarily due to an increase in recoverable operating expenses for comparable periods, an increase in the weighted average occupancy of the portfolio for comparable periods, which was driven by the completion of repositioning work and subsequent lease-up of space at nine of our properties during 2016 and 2017, as well as the completion of supplemental assessments of certain of our properties resulting in lower reimbursable real estate taxes during 2016. Our Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements revenue was also impacted by the incremental reimbursements from the 41 properties we acquired during 2016 and 2017, partially offset by the decrease in reimbursements from the 11 properties that were sold during 2016 and 2017.\nOther Income\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio other income decreased by $39 thousand, or 5.2%, and $74 thousand, or 7.8%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in our Same Properties Portfolio other income is primarily due to a decrease in late fee income, partially offset by an increase in other miscellaneous income. The decrease in our Total Portfolio income is primarily due to a decrease in late fee income and other miscellaneous income.\nManagement, Leasing and Development Services\nOur Total Portfolio management, leasing and development services revenue increased by $20 thousand, or 4.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to our acquisition of the property located at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard from our unconsolidated joint venture (the JV\u201d) in July 2016. Prior to this acquisition, we earned fees and commissions for providing property and construction management services for the property.\nInterest Income\nInterest income relates to the $6.0 million mortgage loan that we made on July 1, 2016, which was subsequently repaid on June 23, 2017. The loan was secured by an industrial property located in Rancho Cucamonga, California and bore interest at 10.0% per annum. Our Total Portfolio interest income decreased by $14 thousand, or 3.1%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nProperty Expenses\nOur Same Properties Portfolio property expenses increased by $1.9 million or 6.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in overhead costs, an increase in recoverable repairs and maintenance expense, an increase in insurance expense, an increase in real estate tax expense and the receipt of non-comparable insurance reimbursements during 2016, partially offset by a decrease in third-party property management fee expense. The increase in insurance expense was due to the new earthquake policy we obtained in June 2017 and the new environmental policy we obtained in December 2016. The increase in real estate tax expense was due to a decrease in capitalized real estate taxes resulting from the completion of construction at certain of our repositioning properties. Our Total Portfolio property expenses increased by $8.5 million, or 25.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the incremental expenses from the 41 properties we acquired during 2016 and 2017, partially offset by the decrease in property expenses from the 11 properties that were sold during 2016 and 2017.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur Total Portfolio general and administrative expenses increased by $4.2 million, or 24.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to the following: (i) a $1.5 million increase in non-cash equity compensation expense primarily related to equity grants awards granted in December 2016, (ii) a non-comparable $1.0 million insurance reimbursement of legal fees related to prior litigation received during 2016, (iii) a $1.0 million increase in bonus expense due to Company performance, (iv) a $0.6 million increase in payroll and employment related costs and (v) a $0.4 million increase in other various corporate expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in non-employee director compensation expense.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nOur Same Properties Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $2.4 million, or 5.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to acquired lease related intangible and tangible assets for several of our properties becoming fully depreciated during 2016 and 2017, partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense related to capital improvements. Our Total Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense increased $13.4 million, or 26.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to incremental expense from the 41 properties we acquired during 2016 and 2017, and an increase in depreciation expense related to capital improvements, partially offset by the decrease in our Same Properties Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense noted above.\nAcquisition Expenses\nOur Total Portfolio acquisition expenses decreased by $1.4 million, or 75.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2017-01, effective January 1, 2017. Under ASU 2017-01, the 21 properties that we acquired during 2017 were accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the related acquisition costs were capitalized as part of the purchase price of the acquisition on a relative fair value basis. In comparison, 18 of the 20 properties that we acquired during 2016 were accounted for as business combinations, and the related acquisition costs were expensed as incurred. The decrease in acquisition expenses due to the adoption of ASU 2017-01 was partially offset by an increase resulting from the write-off of previously incurred transaction costs related to the termination of a ground lease in March 2017.\nInterest Expense\nOur Total Portfolio interest expense increased by $5.4 million, or 36.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in interest expense is primarily comprised of the following: (i) a $2.3 million increase related to the issuance of $125 million of 3.93% fixed rate senior notes in July 2017, (ii) a $1.9 million increase related to the $125 million and $100 million term loan facility borrowings we made in January 2016 and April 2016, respectively, and (iii) and a $1.4 million increase related to the increase in borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility. The increase was partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in interest expense from the 1065 Walnut Street mortgage loan, which we repaid in advance of maturity on March 20, 2017.\nEquity in Income from Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities\nOur Total Portfolio equity in income from unconsolidated real estate entities decreased by $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due to the acquisition of the remaining 85% ownership interest in the property located at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard from the JV on July 6, 2016. For additional information, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Report on Form 10-K.\nGain on Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we repaid the 1065 Walnut Street mortgage loan and the 12907 Imperial Highway mortgage loan. The gain on extinguishment of debt of $25 thousand represents the write-off of $0.2 million of unamortized loan premiums, partially offset by the $0.2 million penalty incurred for repaying the 1065 Walnut Street mortgage loan in advance of the maturity date.\nGain on Sale of Real Estate\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a total gain of $29.6 million from the disposition of six properties that were sold for an aggregate gross sales price of $98.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a total gain of $17.4 million from the disposition of five properties that were sold for an aggregate gross sales price of $40.7 million.\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Measure: Funds From Operations\nWe calculate funds from operations ( FFO\u201d) attributable to common stockholders in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures.\nManagement uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, and asset impairments, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of performance used by other REITs, FFO may be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs.\nHowever, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other equity REITs may not calculate or interpret FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such\nother REITs' FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to FFO (in thousands):\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>80,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures (1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deduct:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of real estate\n</td> <td>(17,222\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29,573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,377\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on acquisition of unconsolidated joint venture property (2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,332\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from operations (FFO)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: preferred stock dividends\n</td> <td>(9,694\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,875\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,983\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: FFO attributable to noncontrolling interest (3)\n</td> <td>(2,295\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,914\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,751\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: FFO attributable to participating securities (4)\n</td> <td>(642\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(546\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(473\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Amount reflects our 15% ownership interest in the JV that owned the property located at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard for all periods prior to July 6, 2016, when we acquired the remaining 85% ownership interest.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Amounts relate to the Company's acquisition of the remaining 85% ownership interest in the property located at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard from the JV.

NOI is calculated as total revenue from real estate operations including i) rental income ii) tenant reimbursements, and iii) other income less property expenses (before interest expense, depreciation and amortization).\nWe use NOI as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, gains (or losses) on sale of real estate and other non-operating items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that NOI will be useful to investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because NOI excludes depreciation and amortization expense and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties (all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations), the utility of NOI as a measure of our performance is limited. Other equity REITs may not calculate NOI in a similar manner and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to such other REITs' NOI. Accordingly, NOI should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.\nNOI on a cash-basis ( Cash NOI\u201d) is a non-GAAP measure, which we calculate by adding or subtracting the following items from NOI: i) fair value lease revenue and ii) straight-line rental revenue adjustments. We use Cash NOI, together with NOI, as a supplemental performance measure. Cash NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. Cash NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table sets forth the revenue and expense items comprising NOI and the adjustments to calculate Cash NOI (in thousands):\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate ( EBITDAre\u201d) in accordance with the standards established by NAREIT. EBITDAre is calculated as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses and adjustments to reflect our proportionate share of EBITDAre from our unconsolidated joint venture.\nWe believe that EBITDAre is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of our operating performance as a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of our properties. We also use this measure in ratios to compare our performance to that of our industry peers. In addition, we believe EBITDAre is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of equity REITs. However, our industry peers may not calculate EBITDAre in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do and, accordingly, our EBITDAre may not be\ncomparable to our peers' EBITDAre. Accordingly, EBITDAre should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) as a measure of our performance.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to EBITDAre (in thousands):\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>25,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>80,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures (1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of real estate\n</td> <td>(17,222\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29,573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,377\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on acquisition of unconsolidated joint venture property (2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,332\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDAre\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Amount reflects our 15% ownership interest in the JV that owned the property located at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard for all periods prior to July 6, 2016, when we acquired the remaining 85% ownership interest.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Amounts relate to the Company's acquisition of the remaining 85% ownership interest in the property located at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard from the JV.

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through available cash on hand, cash flow from operations, by drawing on our unsecured revolving credit facility and by issuing shares of common stock pursuant to the at-the-market equity offering program described below.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through net cash flow from operations, proceeds from long-term secured and unsecured financings, borrowings available under our unsecured revolving credit facility, the issuance of equity securities, including preferred stock, and proceeds from selective real estate dispositions as we identify capital recycling opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents were $180.6 million, and we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility, leaving $350.0 million available for future borrowings.\nSources of Liquidity\nCash Flow from Operations\nCash flow from operations is one of our key sources of liquidity and is primarily dependent upon: (i) the occupancy levels and lease rates at our properties, (ii) our ability to collect rent, (iii) the level of operating costs we incur and (iv) our ability to pass through operating expenses to our tenants. We are subject to a number of risks related to general economic and other unpredictable conditions, which have the potential to affect our overall performance and resulting cash flows from operations. However, based on our current portfolio mix and business strategy, we anticipate that we will be able to generate positive cash flows from operations.\nATM Program\nOn June 13, 2018, we established a new at-the-market equity offering program (the $400 Million ATM Program\u201d) pursuant to which we may sell from time to time up to an aggregate of $400.0 million of our common stock through sales agents. The $400 Million ATM Program replaces our previous $300 million at-the-market equity offering program which was established on September 21, 2017 (the Prior ATM Program\u201d). All $300.0 million of shares of our common stock under the Prior ATM Program were sold prior to establishing the $400 Million ATM Program.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold 18,177,242 shares of our common stock under the $400 Million ATM Program and the Prior ATM Program, at a weighted average price of $31.12 per share, for gross proceeds of $565.6 million, and net proceeds of $557.1 million, after deducting the sales agents' fee. As of December 31, 2018, we had the capacity to issue up to an additional $63.4 million of common stock under the $400 Million ATM Program.\nFuture sales, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and capital needs. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering of shares under the $400 Million ATM Program, if any, to fund potential acquisition opportunities, repay amounts outstanding from time to time under our unsecured revolving credit facility or other debt financing obligations, to fund our development or redevelopment activities and/or for general corporate purposes.\nEquity Offerings\nWe evaluate the capital markets on an ongoing basis for opportunities to raise capital, and as circumstances warrant, we may issue additional securities, from time to time, to fund acquisitions or repositioning costs, for the repayment of long-term debt upon maturity and for other general corporate purposes. Any future issuance, however, is dependent upon market conditions, available pricing and capital needs and there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such offerings of securities.\nCapital Recycling\nWe continuously evaluate opportunities for the potential disposition of properties in our portfolio when we believe such disposition is appropriate in view of our business objectives. In evaluating these opportunities, we consider a variety of criteria including, but not limited to, local market conditions and lease rates, asset type and location, as well as potential uses of proceeds and tax considerations. Tax considerations include entering into tax-deferred like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the Code ( 1031 Exchange\u201d), when possible, to defer some or all of the taxable gains, if any, on dispositions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed the sale of six of our properties for a total gross sales price of $48.0 million and total net cash proceeds of $45.2 million. Total net cash proceeds of $36.6 million from five of the dispositions were used to partially fund the acquisition of five properties the year ended December 31, 2018, through 1031 Exchange transactions.\nWe anticipate continuing to selectively and opportunistically dispose of properties, however, the timing of any potential future dispositions will depend on market conditions, asset-specific circumstances or opportunities, and our capital needs. Our ability to dispose of selective properties on advantageous terms, or at all, is dependent upon a number of factors including the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable.\nCredit Facility\nWe have a $450.0 million senior unsecured credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d), comprised of a $350.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the \"Revolver\") and a $100.0 million unsecured term loan facility (the \"$100 Million Term Loan Facility\"). The Revolver is scheduled to mature on February 12, 2021 and has two six-month extension options available for a maximum maturity date of February 14, 2022, subject to certain conditions and the payment of an additional fee. The $100 Million Term Loan Facility is scheduled to mature on February 14, 2022. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, we may request additional lender commitments up to an additional aggregate $550.0 million, which may be comprised of additional revolving commitments under the Revolver, an increase to the $100 Million Term Loan Facility, additional term loan tranches or any combination of the foregoing.\nInterest on the Credit Facility is generally to be paid based upon, at our option, either (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin that is based upon our leverage ratio or (ii) the Base Rate (which is defined as the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the administrative agent's prime rate or (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin that is based on our leverage ratio. The margins for the Revolver range in amount from 1.10% to 1.50% per annum for LIBOR-based loans and 0.10% to 0.50% per annum for Base Rate-based loans, depending on our leverage ratio. The margins for the $100 Million Term Loan Facility range in amount from 1.20% to 1.70% per annum for LIBOR-based loans and 0.20% to 0.70% per annum for Base Rate-based loans, depending on our leverage ratio.\nIf we attain one additional investment grade rating by one or more of Standard & Poor's ( S&P\u201d) or Moody's Investor Services ( Moody's\u201d) to complement our current investment grade Fitch rating, we may elect to convert the pricing structure under the Credit Facility to be based on such rating. In that event, the margins for the Revolver will range in amount from 0.825% to 1.550% per annum for LIBOR-based loans and 0.00% to 0.55% per annum for Base Rate-based loans, depending on such rating, and the margins for the $100 Million Term Loan Facility will range in amount from 0.90% to 1.75% per annum for LIBOR-based loans and 0.00% to 0.75% per annum for Base Rate-based loans, depending on such ratings.\nIn addition to the interest payable on amounts outstanding under the Revolver, we are required to pay an applicable facility fee, based upon our leverage ratio, on the aggregate amount of each lender's Revolving Credit Commitment (whether or not such Revolving Credit Commitment is drawn), as defined in the Credit Facility. The applicable facility fee will range in amount from 0.15% to 0.30% per annum, depending on our leverage ratio. In the event that we convert the pricing structure to be based on an investment-grade rating, the applicable facility fee will range in amount from 0.125% to 0.30% per annum, depending on such rating.\nThe Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Company and by substantially all of the current and to-be-formed subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership that own an unencumbered property. The Credit Facility is not secured by the Company's properties or by equity interests in the subsidiaries that hold such properties.\nThe Revolver and the $100 Million Term Loan Facility may be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. Amounts borrowed under the $100 Million Term Loan Facility and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.\nThe Credit Facility contains usual and customary events of default including defaults in the payment of principal, interest or fees, defaults in compliance with the covenants set forth in the Credit Facility and other loan documentation, cross-defaults to certain other indebtedness, and bankruptcy and other insolvency defaults. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the Credit Facility, the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans, together with all accrued unpaid interest and other amounts owing in respect thereof, may be declared immediately due and payable.\nAs of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Revolver, leaving $350.0 million available for future borrowings.\n$150 Million Term Loan Facility\nOn May 22, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement for a senior unsecured term loan facility (the $150 Million Term Loan Facility\u201d) that initially permits aggregate borrowings of up to $150.0 million, the total of which we borrowed the same day at closing. Under the terms of the $150 Million Term Loan Facility, we may request additional incremental term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $100.0 million. Any increase in borrowings is subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions and the identification of lenders willing to make available such additional amounts. The maturity date of the $150 Million Term Loan Facility is May 22, 2025.\nInterest on the $150 Million Term Loan Facility is generally to be paid based upon, at our option, either (i) LIBOR plus an applicable Eurodollar rate margin or (ii) the Base Rate (which is defined as the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the administrative agent's prime rate or (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00%), plus an applicable base rate margin. The applicable Eurodollar rate margin will range from 1.50% to 2.20% per annum for LIBOR-based borrowings and the applicable base rate margin will range from 0.50% to 1.20% per annum for Base Rate-based loans, depending on our leverage ratio.\nIf we obtain one additional investment grade rating from one or more of S&P or Moody's to complement our current investment grade Fitch rating, we may elect to convert the pricing structure under the $150 Million Term Loan Facility to be based on such rating. Under this pricing structure, the applicable Eurodollar rate margin will range from 1.40% to 2.35% per annum and the applicable base rate margin will range from 0.40% to 1.35% per annum.\nWe have the option to voluntarily prepay any amounts borrowed under the $150 Million Term Loan Facility in whole or in part at any time, subject to certain notice requirements. To the extent that we prepay all or any portion of a loan prior to May 22, 2020, we will pay a prepayment premium equal to (i) if such prepayment occurs prior to May 22, 2019, 2.00% of the principal amount so prepaid, and (ii) if such prepayment occurs on or after May 22, 2019, but prior to May 22, 2020, 1.00% of the principal amount so prepaid. Amounts borrowed under the $150 Million Term Loan Facility and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.\nInvestment Grade Rating\nIn October 2018, Fitch Ratings upgraded our investment grade credit rating to BBB from BBB- with a stable outlook on the Revolver, the $100 Million Term Loan Facility, the $150 Million Term Loan Facility, our $225 million term loan facility, our $100 million unsecured guaranteed senior notes and our $125 million unsecured guaranteed senior notes. They also upgraded our investment grade credit rating to BB+ from BB on our 5.875% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and assigned a BB+ rating on our 5.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. Our credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analysis of us, and, although it is our intent to maintain our investment grade credit rating, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. In the event our current credit ratings are downgraded, it may become difficult or more expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing indebtedness as maturities become due.\nUses of Liquidity\nAcquisitions\nOne of our most significant liquidity needs has historically been for the acquisition of real estate properties. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired 30 properties with a combined 3.1 million square feet, for a total gross purchase price $492.9 million, and we are actively monitoring a volume of properties in our markets that we believe represent attractive potential investment opportunities to continue to grow our business. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we acquired three properties, with a combined 0.7 million square feet, for a total gross purchase price of $133.8 million. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have approximately $311.4 million of acquisitions under contract or letter of intent. There can be no assurance we will complete any such acquisitions. While the actual number of acquisitions that we complete will be dependent upon a number of factors, in the short term, we expect to fund our acquisitions through available cash on hand, cash flows from operations, borrowings available under the Revolver, recycling capital through property dispositions and, in the long term, through the issuance of equity securities or proceeds from long-term secured and unsecured financings.\nRecurring and Nonrecurring Capital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures are considered part of both our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred $5.6 million of recurring capital expenditures, which was an increase of $3.1 million over the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred $45.5 million of non-recurring capital expenditures, which was an increase of $10.2 million over the prior year. The increase in non-recurring capital expenditures is primarily due to an increase in our redevelopment and repositioning activity and the growth of our overall portfolio. As discussed above under -Factors that May Influence Future Results -Acquisitions and Value-Add Repositioning of Properties, as of December 31, 2018, 11 of our properties were in various stages of redevelopment and repositioning or lease-up, and we anticipate beginning repositioning work on two additional properties during 2019. We currently estimate that approximately $43.2 million of capital will be required over the next ten quarters (1Q-2019 through 2Q-2021) to complete the redevelopment and repositioning of these properties. However, this estimate is based on our current construction plan and budgets, both of which are subject to change as a result of a number of factors. If we are unable to complete construction on schedule or within budget, we could incur increased construction costs and experience potential delays in leasing the properties. We expect to fund these projects through a combination of cash flow from operations, the issuance of common stock under the $400 Million ATM Program and borrowings available under the Revolver.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our principal obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018, including (i) scheduled principal payments and debt maturities, (ii) periodic interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness and interest rate swaps, (iii) office and ground lease payments and (iv) other contractual obligations (in thousands):\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year (2019)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years (2020-2021)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years (2022-2023)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n(After 2023)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments and debt maturities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>383,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>376,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>761,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - fixed rate debt(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - variable rate debt(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office lease payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ground lease payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>428,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>418,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>952,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Reflects scheduled interest payments on our fixed rate debt, including the $100 million unsecured guaranteed senior notes, the $125 million unsecured guaranteed senior notes and the Gilbert/La Palma mortgage loan.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Reflects an estimate of interest payments due on variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps.

In addition, we intend to make distribution payments to holders of OP Units and dividend payments to holders of our preferred stock.\nOn February 11, 2019, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.185 per share of common stock and a quarterly cash distribution in the amount of $0.185 per OP Unit, to be paid on April 15, 2019, to holders of record as of March 29, 2019.\nOn February 11, 2019, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.367188 per share of our 5.875% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and $0.367188 per share of our 5.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, to be paid on March 29, 2019, to holders of record as of March 15, 2019.\nConsolidated Indebtedness\nThe following table sets forth certain information with respect to our consolidated indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stated\nInterest Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effective\nInterest Rate(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Principal Balance\n(in thousands)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity Date of Effective Swaps\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured Debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$60M Term Loan(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8/1/2023(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR+1.70%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.619\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(4)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2/15/2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gilbert/La Palma\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3/1/2031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.125%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.125\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured Debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolver(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2/12/2021(6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR +1.10%(7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.603\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$100 Million Term Loan Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2/14/2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR +1.20%(7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.964\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(8)\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8/14/2021\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$225 Million Term Loan Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1/14/2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR +1.20%(7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.574\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(9)\n</td> <td>225,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1/14/2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$150 Million Term Loan Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5/22/2025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR +1.50%(7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.003\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$100 Million Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8/6/2025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.29%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.290\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$125 Million Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7/13/2027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.930%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.930\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.444\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>761,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes the effect of interest rate swaps that were effective as of December 31, 2018.

As of December 31, 2018, $610.7 million, or 80%, of our outstanding indebtedness had an interest rate that was effectively fixed under either the terms of the loan ($227.6 million) or an interest rate swap ($383.1 million).\nAt December 31, 2018, we had total indebtedness of approximately $761.1 million, reflecting a net debt to total combined market capitalization of approximately 15.8%. Our total combined market capitalization is defined as the sum of the liquidation value of our preferred stock plus the market value of our common stock excluding shares of nonvested restricted stock, plus the aggregate value of common units not owned by us, plus the value of our net debt. Our net debt is defined as our consolidated indebtedness less cash and cash equivalents.\nFourth Amendment to Credit Agreement\nOn January 16, 2018, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement (the Fourth Amendment\u201d) to amend our Credit Agreement, dated as of January 14, 2016 (as amended from time to time) for our $225.0 million unsecured term loan facility (the $225 Million Term Loan Facility\u201d).\nAmounts outstanding under the $225 Million Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin that is based upon our leverage ratio or (ii) the Base Rate, as defined in the $225 Million Term Loan Facility, plus an applicable margin that is based on our leverage ratio. The Fourth Amendment decreases the applicable margin for LIBOR-based borrowings from a range of 1.50% to 2.25% per annum to a range of 1.20% to 1.70% per annum and decreases the applicable margin for Base Rate-based borrowings from a range of 0.50% to 1.25% per annum to a range of 0.20% to 0.70% per annum.\nIf we obtain one additional investment grade rating by one or more of S&P or Moody's to complement our current investment grade Fitch rating, we may elect to convert the pricing structure under the $225 Million Term Loan Facility to be based on such rating. Under this pricing structure, the Fourth Amendment decreases the applicable margin for LIBOR-based borrowings from a range of 1.40% to 2.35% per annum to a range of 0.90% to 1.75% per annum and decreases the applicable margin for Base Rate-based borrowings from a range of 0.40% to 1.35% per annum to a range of 0.00% to 0.75% per annum.\nModification of $60 Million Term Loan\nOn June 27, 2018, we entered into the Second Modification Agreement (the Modification Agreement\u201d) to amend our Term Loan Agreement, dated as of July 24, 2013 (as amended from time to time) for our $60.0 million term loan (the $60 Million Term Loan\u201d)\nThe Modification Agreement, among other things, (i) extends the maturity date of the $60 Million Term Loan from August 1, 2019, to August 1, 2023, (ii) decreases the interest rate from LIBOR plus 1.90% per annum to LIBOR plus 1.70% per annum, (iii) provides for one 24-month extension option, subject to certain terms and conditions, and (iv) amends the repayment schedule of the $60 Million Term Loan by adding 36 months of interest only payments, followed by equal monthly payments of principal ($65,250), plus accrued interest until maturity.\nDebt Covenants\nThe Credit Facility, the $225 Million Term Loan Facility, the $150 Million Term Loan Facility, the $100 million unsecured guaranteed senior notes (the $100 Million Notes\u201d) and the $125 Million unsecured guaranteed senior notes (the $125 Million Notes\u201d) all include a series of financial and other covenants that we must comply with, including the following covenants which are tested on a quarterly basis:\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maintaining a ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value of not more than 60%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For the Credit Facility, the $225 Million Term Loan Facility, and $150 Million Term Loan Facility, maintaining a ratio of secured debt to total asset value of not more than 45%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For the $100 Million Notes and the $125 Million Notes, maintaining a ratio of secured debt to total asset value of not more than 40%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maintaining a ratio of total secured recourse debt to total asset value of not more than 15%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maintaining a minimum tangible net worth of at least the sum of (i) $760,740,750, and (ii) an amount equal to at least 75% of the net equity proceeds received by the Company after September 30, 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 243: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maintaining a ratio of adjusted EBITDA (as defined in each of the loan agreements) to fixed charges of at least 1.50 to 1.0;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 244: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maintaining a ratio of total unsecured debt to total unencumbered asset value of not more than 60%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 245: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maintaining a ratio of unencumbered NOI (as defined in each of the loan agreements) to unsecured interest expense of at least 1.75 to 1.0.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The Credit Facility, the $225 Million Term Loan Facility, the $150 Million Term Loan Facility, $100 Million Notes and the $125 Million Notes also contain limitations on our ability to pay distributions on our common stock.

These increases were partially offset by the following: (i) a decrease of $136.0 million in draws on the Revolver, (ii) a decrease of $125.0 million in cash proceeds from the issuance of the $125 Million Notes in July 2017, (iii) a decrease of $72.5 million in net cash proceeds from the issuance of the 5.87% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock in November 2017 (the Series B Preferred Stock\u201d), (iv) an increase of $13.7 million in dividends and distributions paid to common stockholders and unit holders, primarily resulting from the increase in the number of common shares outstanding and the increase in our quarterly per share cash dividend and (v) an increase of $5.0 million in dividends paid to preferred stockholders due to the issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock in November 2017.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2017 to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table summarizes the cash flows of Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc. for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 250: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(606,900\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(361,214\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(245,686\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>521,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>315,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>206,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities.

In addition, most of the leases provide for fixed rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases to real estate taxes, utility expenses and other operating expenses may be partially offset by the contractual rent increases and tenant payment of taxes and expenses described above. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical financial position or results of operations.", "summary": "The report discusses the operations and financial condition of Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc., a real estate investment trust focused on industrial properties in Southern California.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors,\u201d Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Business\u201d and our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially\nfrom those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCompany Overview\nRexford Industrial Realty, Inc. is a self-administered and self-managed full-service REIT focused on owning and operating industrial properties in Southern California infill markets. We were formed as a Maryland corporation on January 18, 2013 and Rexford Industrial Realty, L.P. (the Operating Partnership\u201d), of which we are the sole general partner, was formed as a Maryland limited partnership on January 18, 2013. Through our controlling interest in our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, we own, manage, lease, acquire and develop industrial real estate primarily located in Southern California infill markets, and from time to time, acquire or provide mortgage debt secured by industrial property. We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT under the Code, and generally are not subject to federal taxes on our income to the extent we distribute our income to our shareholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our consolidated portfolio consisted of 176 properties with approximately 21.3 million rentable square feet. In addition, we currently manage an additional 20 properties with approximately 1.2 million rentable square feet.\nOur goal is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders by providing superior access to industrial property investments and mortgage debt secured by industrial property in Southern California infill markets. Our target markets provide us with opportunities to acquire both stabilized properties generating favorable cash flow, as well as properties where we can enhance returns through value-add renovations and redevelopment. Scarcity of available space and high barriers limiting new construction of for-lease product all contribute to create superior long-term supply/demand fundamentals within our target infill Southern California industrial property markets. With our vertically integrated platform and extensive value-add investment and management capabilities, we believe we are in a position to capitalize upon the opportunities in our markets to achieve our objectives.\nHighlights\nAcquisitions\n \u2022 During 2018, we acquired 30 properties, with a combined 3.1 million rentable square feet, for an aggregate cost of $492.9 million.  Repositioning\n \u2022 During 2018, we completed the repositioning of six of our properties located at 301-445 Figueroa Street, 28903 Avenue Paine, 14748-14750 Nelson Avenue, 15401 Figueroa Street, 2722 Fairview Street and 1580 Carson Street with a combined 0.6 million rentable square feet. As of December 31, 2018, 301-445 Figueroa Street and 28903 Avenue Paine are stabilized at 100% occupancy, and 14748-14750 Nelson Avenue is 86% leased. During 2018, we also completed the repositioning and lease-up of 43,927 rentable square feet of space at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard. \n \u2022 During 2018, we pre-leased our 56,306 square foot single-tenant development property located at 1998 Surveyor Avenue and in January 2019 the tenant took possession of the property.  Dispositions\n \u2022 During 2018, we completed the sale of six of our properties with a combined 0.3 million rentable square feet, for a total gross sales price of $48.0 million, and total net cash proceeds of $45.2 million.  Equity\n \u2022 During 2018, we sold a total of 18,177,242 shares of our common stock under our various at-the-market equity offering programs, for gross proceeds of $565.6 million, or approximately $31.12 per share, and net proceeds of $557.1 million after deducting the sales agents' fee.  Financing\n \u2022 In January 2018, we amended our $225.0 million unsecured term loan facility, which reduced the applicable margin for LIBOR-based borrowings from a range of 1.50% to 2.25% per annum to a range of 1.20% to 1.70% per annum. \n \u2022 In May 2018, we closed on a seven-year $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility that matures May 22, 2025. The term loan facility bears interest at LIBOR plus an applicable Eurodollar rate margin that will range from 1.50% to 2.20% per annum depending on our leverage ratio. \n \u2022 In June 2018, we amended our $60 million term loan, which extended the maturity date from August 1, 2019 to August 1, 2023, and decreased the interest rate from LIBOR plus 1.90% per annum to LIBOR plus 1.70% per annum. \nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\nMarket Fundamentals\nOur operating results depend upon the infill Southern California industrial real estate market.\nThe infill Southern California industrial real estate sector has continued to exhibit strong fundamentals. These high-barrier infill markets are characterized by a relative scarcity of available product, operating at near full occupancy, coupled with limited ability to introduce new supply due to high land and development costs and a dearth of developable land in markets experiencing a net reduction in supply as more industrial property is converted to non-industrial uses than can be delivered. Consequently, available industrial supply continues to decrease in many of our target infill submarkets, landlord concessions are at cyclically low levels and construction deliveries are falling short of demand. Meanwhile, underlying tenant demand within our infill target markets continues to demonstrate growth, illustrated or driven by strong re-leasing spreads, an expanding regional economy, substantial growth in e-commerce transaction and delivery volumes, as well as further compression of delivery time-frames to consumers and to businesses, increasing the significance of last-mile facilities for timely fulfillment. Despite potential concerns related to global growth, tax reform and changes to trade and tariff policies and the impact of rising interest rates, we continue to observe a number of positive trends within our target infill markets. Based on current observations within the infill Southern California industrial property market and within our property portfolio, we expect these positive trends may continue into the upcoming year.\nIn Los Angeles County, positive market trends continued through 2018, as historically high occupancy levels persisted year-over-year and asking lease rates increased significantly during 2018. Current market conditions indicate rents are likely to continue their upward trend with potential increases through 2019, as occupancy still remains at near capacity levels and new development is limited by a lack of land availability and an increase in land and development costs.\nIn Orange County, market fundamentals remained favorable throughout 2018. With steady tenant demand and a continued low availability of industrial product in this region, average asking lease rents continued their upward trend during 2018 and vacancy remained at historically low levels. Current regional market conditions indicate the potential for continued rental growth through 2019.\nIn San Diego, although there was a slight increase in vacancy year-over-year, net absorption was positive during 2018 and overall asking lease rates increased year-over-year.\nIn Ventura County, vacancy increased year-over-year and asking lease rates increased year-over year.\nLastly, in the Inland Empire, new industrial product continues to be absorbed well in the market. In the Inland Empire West, which contains infill markets in which we operate, vacancy remained at historically low levels and asking lease rates were unchanged year-over-year. We expect the outlook for the Inland Empire West to remain positive over the upcoming year. We generally do not focus on properties located within the non-infill Inland Empire East sub-market where the development and construction pipeline for new supply is substantial.\nAcquisitions and Value-Add Repositioning of Properties\nThe Company's growth strategy comprises acquiring leased, stabilized properties as well as properties with value-add opportunities to improve functionality and to deploy our value-driven asset management programs in order to increase cash flow and value. Additionally, from time to time, we may acquire land parcels or properties with excess land where we may construct new buildings, although we do not anticipate this to be a substantial part of our operations. Acquisitions may comprise single property investments as well as the purchase of portfolios of properties, with transaction values ranging from sub-$10 million dollar single-property investments to portfolios potentially valued in the billions of dollars. The Company's geographic focus remains infill Southern California. However, from time-to-time, portfolios could be acquired comprising a critical mass of infill Southern California industrial property that could include some assets located in markets outside of infill Southern California. In general, to the extent non-infill-Southern California assets were to be acquired as part of a larger portfolio, the Company may underwrite such investments with the potential to dispose such assets over a certain period of time in order to maximize its core focus on infill Southern California, while endeavoring to take appropriate steps to satisfy REIT safe harbor requirements to avoid prohibited transactions under REIT tax laws.\nA key component of our growth strategy is to acquire properties through off-market and lightly marketed transactions that are often operating at below-market occupancy or below-market rent at the time of acquisition or that have near-term lease roll-over or that provide opportunities to add value through functional or physical repositioning and improvements. Through\nvarious redevelopment, repositioning, and professional leasing and marketing strategies, we seek to increase the properties' functionality and attractiveness to prospective tenants and, over time, to stabilize the properties at occupancy rates that meet or exceed market rates.\nA repositioning may consist of a range of improvements to a property. These may include a complete structural renovation of a property whereby we convert large underutilized spaces into a series of smaller and more functional spaces, or it may include the creation of additional square footage, the modernization of the property site, the elimination of functional obsolescence, the addition or enhancement of loading areas and truck access, the enhancement of fire-life-safety systems or other accretive improvements. Because each repositioning effort is unique and determined based on the property, targeted tenants and overall trends in the general market and specific submarket, the timing and effect of the repositioning on our rental revenue and occupancy levels will vary, and, as a result, will affect the comparison of our results of operations from period to period with limited predictability.\nAs of December 31, 2018, seven of our properties were in various stages of repositioning or development and four of our properties were in the lease-up stage. In addition, we anticipate beginning repositioning work on two additional properties in early 2019. The table below sets forth a summary of these properties, as well as the four projects that were stabilized during 2018. In addition to the properties in the table below, we also have a range of smaller spaces in value-add repositioning or renovation, that due to their smaller size, are not presented below, however, in the aggregate, may be substantial.\n\n (1) The estimated construction period is subject to change as a result of a number of factors including but not limited to permit requirements, delays in construction, changes in scope, and other unforeseen circumstances. \n (2) We expect to demolish the existing 49,976 rentable square feet building and construct a new 89,270 rentable square foot multi-unit building. \n (3) We acquired 1998 Surveyor Avenue as an under-construction building for $5.8 million and the assumed the seller's fixed-price construction contracts with $4.4 million of remaining costs at acquisition. At completion, the property will be one single-tenant building containing 56,306 rentable square feet. During 2018, we pre-leased the property and in January 2019 the tenant took possession of the property. \n (4) 9615 Norwalk is a 10.26 acre storage-yard with three buildings totaling 38,362 rentable square feet. In January 2019, we converted the tenant's month to month land lease to a term lease with an expiration date of June 30, 2020. We will \ndemolish the existing buildings and construct a new 201,808 rentable square foot building upon termination of the land lease.\n (5) As of December 31, 2018, we are repositioning space aggregating 109,129 rentable square feet at 3233 Mission Oaks. During the first quarter of 2018, we completed the repositioning of a 43,927 rentable square foot unit at 3233 Mission Oaks. \n (6) We plan to reposition a 36,000 rentable square foot unit at 7110 Rosecrans Avenue when the current lease expires in the first quarter of 2019. \n (7) We consider a repositioning property to be stabilized at the earlier of the following: (i) upon reaching 90% occupancy or (ii) one year from the date of completion of repositioning construction work.  Properties that are nonoperational as a result of repositioning or redevelopment activity may qualify for varying levels of interest, insurance and real estate tax capitalization during the development and construction period. An increase in our repositioning and development activities resulting from value-add acquisitions could cause an increase in the asset balances qualifying for interest, insurance and tax capitalization in future periods. We capitalized $2.1 million of interest expense and $0.9 million of insurance and real estate tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2018, related to our repositioning and redevelopment projects.\nRental Revenue\nOur operating results depend primarily upon generating rental revenue from the properties in our consolidated portfolio. The amount of rental revenue generated by these properties is affected by our ability to maintain or increase occupancy levels and rental rates at our properties, which will depend upon our ability to lease vacant space and re-lease expiring space at favorable rates.\nOccupancy Rates\nAs of December 31, 2018, our consolidated portfolio was 95.4% occupied. We believe the opportunity to increase occupancy at our properties will be an important driver of future revenue growth. An opportunity to drive this growth will derive from the lease-up of recently completed repositioning projects and the completion and lease-up of repositioning projects that are currently under construction and planned for near-term construction.\nAs summarized in the table above, as of December 31, 2018, 11 of our properties with a combined 0.5 million vacant rentable square feet, were in various stages of repositioning or lease-up. These 11 properties are concentrated in our Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego and Ventura markets, and represent 2.2% of our total consolidated portfolio square footage as of December 31, 2018. Including vacant repositioning and lease-up space at these 11 properties, our weighted average occupancy rate as of December 31, 2018, in Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego and Ventura was 96.1%, 95.1%, 95.2% and 88.6%, respectively. Excluding vacant repositioning and lease-up space at these 11 properties, our weighted average occupancy rate as of December 31, 2018, in these markets was 97.8%, 97.2%, 97.4% and 97.2%, respectively, and our overall portfolio occupancy excluding these properties was 97.5%. We believe that a significant portion of our long-term future growth will come from the completion of these projects currently under or scheduled for repositioning, as well as through the identification or acquisition of new opportunities for redevelopment and repositioning, whether in our existing portfolio or through new investments, which may vary from period to period subject to market conditions.\nThe occupancy rate of properties not undergoing repositioning is affected by regional and local economic conditions in our Southern California infill markets. Throughout 2018, the Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego county markets have continued to show historically low vacancy and positive absorption, resulting from high tenant demand combined with low product availability. Accordingly, our properties in these markets have exhibited a similar trend. We expect general market conditions to remain positive in 2019, and we believe the opportunity to increase occupancy and rental rates at our properties will be an important driver of future revenue growth.\nLeasing Activity and Rental Rates\nThe following tables set forth our leasing activity for new and renewal leases on a quarterly basis for the year ended December 31, 2018:\n\n\n (1) Effective rent per square foot is the average base rent calculated in accordance with GAAP, over the term of the lease, expressed in dollars per square foot per year. Includes all new and renewal leases executed during each respective quarter. \n (2) Calculated as the change between GAAP rents for new or renewal leases and the expiring GAAP rents on the expiring leases for the same space. \n (3) Calculated as the change between cash rents for new or renewal leases and the expiring cash rents on the expiring leases for the same space. \n (4) The GAAP and cash re-leasing spreads for new leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2018, exclude 63 leases aggregating 719,616 rentable square feet for which there was no comparable lease data. Of these 63 excluded leases, 24 leases aggregating 444,613 rentable square feet are leases of recently repositioned space. Comparable leases generally exclude: (i) space that has never been occupied under our ownership, (ii) recently repositioned/redeveloped space, (iii) space that has been vacant for over one year or (iv) space with lease terms shorter than six months. \n (5) The GAAP and cash re-leasing rent spreads for renewal leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2018, exclude 11 leases aggregating 100,567 rentable square feet for which there was no comparable lease data due to either (i) space with different lease structures or (ii) space with lease terms shorter than six months. \n (6) Includes eight leases totaling 200,469 rentable square feet that expired during the year ended December 31, 2018, for which the space was placed into repositioning after each tenant vacated. \n (7) Retention is calculated as renewal lease square footage plus relocation/expansion square footage, divided by the square footage of leases expiring during the period. Retention excludes expiring leases associated with space that is placed into repositioning after the tenant vacates.  Our leasing activity is impacted both by our redevelopment and repositioning efforts, as well as by market conditions. While we reposition a property, its space may become unavailable for leasing until completion of our repositioning efforts. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we stabilized 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard - Unit H, 301-445 Figueroa Street and\n28903 Avenue Paine with a combined 289,512 rentable square feet and leased an additional 172,890 rentable square feet at 14748-14750 Nelson Avenue. Additionally, in January 2019 we completed and stabilized our development property located at 1998 Surveyor Avenue. As of the date of this filing, we have six incomplete repositioning and development projects with estimated construction completion periods ranging from the second quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of 2021 and four properties in the lease-up stage. We expect these properties to have positive impacts on our leasing activity and revenue generation as we complete our value-add repositioning plan and place these properties in service.\nScheduled Lease Expirations\nOur ability to re-lease space subject to expiring leases is affected by economic and competitive conditions in our markets and by the desirability of our individual properties, which may impact our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, 0.7 million rentable square feet of our portfolio was available for lease, 0.3 million rentable square feet of vacant space was under repositioning and leases representing 0.2 million rentable square feet of our portfolio expired on December 31, 2018. Additionally, leases representing 12.9% and 19.6% of the aggregate rentable square footage of our portfolio are scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we renewed 246 leases for 1.9 million rentable square feet, resulting in a 65.4% retention rate. Our retention rate during the year was impacted by our strategy to roll certain tenants at below-market rents and to replace them with higher quality tenants paying higher rents with minimal down time. New and renewal leases signed during the current year had a weighted average term of 4.8 and 3.5 years, respectively, and we expect future new and renewal leases to have similar terms.\nThe leases scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2020, represent 13.7% and 19.6%, respectively, of the total annualized base rent for our portfolio as of December 31, 2018. We estimate that, on a weighted average basis, in-place rents of leases scheduled to expire in 2019 and 2020 are currently below current market asking rents, although individual units or properties within any particular submarket presently may be leased either above, below, or at the current market asking rates within that submarket. As described in the above Market Fundamentals section, we expect market dynamics to remain strong heading into 2019 and that these positive trends will provide a favorable environment for additional increases in lease renewal rates. Accordingly, we expect 2019 will show positive renewal rates and leasing spreads. We also currently do not see any reason not to expect that 2020 lease expirations will show positive growth upon renewal; however, it is difficult to predict market conditions that far into the future.\nConditions in Our Markets\nThe properties in our portfolio are located primarily in Southern California infill markets. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in this market may affect our overall performance.\nProperty Expenses\nOur rental expenses generally consist of utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, site repair and maintenance costs, and the allocation of overhead costs. For the majority of our properties, our property expenses are recovered, in part, by either the triple net provisions or modified gross expense reimbursements in tenant leases. The majority of our leases also comprise contractual three percent annual rental rate increases meant, in part, to help mitigate potential increases in property expenses over time. However, the terms of our leases vary and, in some instances, we may absorb property expenses. Our overall financial results will be impacted by the extent to which we are able to pass-through property expenses to our tenants.\nTaxable REIT Subsidiary\nAs of December 31, 2018, our Operating Partnership indirectly and wholly owns Rexford Industrial Realty and Management, Inc., which we refer to as the services company. We have elected, together with our services company, to treat our services company as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary generally may provide non-customary and other services to our tenants and engage in activities that we may not engage in directly without adversely affecting our qualification as a REIT, provided a taxable REIT subsidiary may not operate or manage a lodging facility or health care facility or provide rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated. We may form additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future, and our Operating Partnership may contribute some or all of its interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries or their assets to our services company.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors,\u201d Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Business\u201d and our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially\nfrom those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCompany Overview\nRexford Industrial Realty, Inc. is a self-administered and self-managed full-service REIT focused on owning and operating industrial properties in Southern California infill markets. We were formed as a Maryland corporation on January 18, 2013 and Rexford Industrial Realty, L.P. (the Operating Partnership\u201d), of which we are the sole general partner, was formed as a Maryland limited partnership on January 18, 2013. Through our controlling interest in our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, we own, manage, lease, acquire and develop industrial real estate primarily located in Southern California infill markets, and from time to time, acquire or provide mortgage debt secured by industrial property. We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT under the Code, and generally are not subject to federal taxes on our income to the extent we distribute our income to our shareholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our consolidated portfolio consisted of 176 properties with approximately 21.3 million rentable square feet. In addition, we currently manage an additional 20 properties with approximately 1.2 million rentable square feet.\nOur goal is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders by providing superior access to industrial property investments and mortgage debt secured by industrial property in Southern California infill markets. Our target markets provide us with opportunities to acquire both stabilized properties generating favorable cash flow, as well as properties where we can enhance returns through value-add renovations and redevelopment. Scarcity of available space and high barriers limiting new construction of for-lease product all contribute to create superior long-term supply/demand fundamentals within our target infill Southern California industrial property markets. With our vertically integrated platform and extensive value-add investment and management capabilities, we believe we are in a position to capitalize upon the opportunities in our markets to achieve our objectives.\nHighlights\nAcquisitions\n \u2022 During 2018, we acquired 30 properties, with a combined 3.1 million rentable square feet, for an aggregate cost of $492.9 million.  Repositioning\n \u2022 During 2018, we completed the repositioning of six of our properties located at 301-445 Figueroa Street, 28903 Avenue Paine, 14748-14750 Nelson Avenue, 15401 Figueroa Street, 2722 Fairview Street and 1580 Carson Street with a combined 0.6 million rentable square feet. As of December 31, 2018, 301-445 Figueroa Street and 28903 Avenue Paine are stabilized at 100% occupancy, and 14748-14750 Nelson Avenue is 86% leased. During 2018, we also completed the repositioning and lease-up of 43,927 rentable square feet of space at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard. \n \u2022 During 2018, we pre-leased our 56,306 square foot single-tenant development property located at 1998 Surveyor Avenue and in January 2019 the tenant took possession of the property.  Dispositions\n \u2022 During 2018, we completed the sale of six of our properties with a combined 0.3 million rentable square feet, for a total gross sales price of $48.0 million, and total net cash proceeds of $45.2 million.  Equity\n \u2022 During 2018, we sold a total of 18,177,242 shares of our common stock under our various at-the-market equity offering programs, for gross proceeds of $565.6 million, or approximately $31.12 per share, and net proceeds of $557.1 million after deducting the sales agents' fee.  Financing\n \u2022 In January 2018, we amended our $225.0 million unsecured term loan facility, which reduced the applicable margin for LIBOR-based borrowings from a range of 1.50% to 2.25% per annum to a range of 1.20% to 1.70% per annum. \n \u2022 In May 2018, we closed on a seven-year $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility that matures May 22, 2025. The term loan facility bears interest at LIBOR plus an applicable Eurodollar rate margin that will range from 1.50% to 2.20% per annum depending on our leverage ratio. \n \u2022 In June 2018, we amended our $60 million term loan, which extended the maturity date from August 1, 2019 to August 1, 2023, and decreased the interest rate from LIBOR plus 1.90% per annum to LIBOR plus 1.70% per annum. \nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\nMarket Fundamentals\nOur operating results depend upon the infill Southern California industrial real estate market.\nThe infill Southern California industrial real estate sector has continued to exhibit strong fundamentals. These high-barrier infill markets are characterized by a relative scarcity of available product, operating at near full occupancy, coupled with limited ability to introduce new supply due to high land and development costs and a dearth of developable land in markets experiencing a net reduction in supply as more industrial property is converted to non-industrial uses than can be delivered. Consequently, available industrial supply continues to decrease in many of our target infill submarkets, landlord concessions are at cyclically low levels and construction deliveries are falling short of demand.

Despite potential concerns related to global growth, tax reform and changes to trade and tariff policies and the impact of rising interest rates, we continue to observe a number of positive trends within our target infill markets. Based on current observations within the infill Southern California industrial property market and within our property portfolio, we expect these positive trends may continue into the upcoming year.\nIn Los Angeles County, positive market trends continued through 2018, as historically high occupancy levels persisted year-over-year and asking lease rates increased significantly during 2018. Current market conditions indicate rents are likely to continue their upward trend with potential increases through 2019, as occupancy still remains at near capacity levels and new development is limited by a lack of land availability and an increase in land and development costs.\nIn Orange County, market fundamentals remained favorable throughout 2018. With steady tenant demand and a continued low availability of industrial product in this region, average asking lease rents continued their upward trend during 2018 and vacancy remained at historically low levels. Current regional market conditions indicate the potential for continued rental growth through 2019.\nIn San Diego, although there was a slight increase in vacancy year-over-year, net absorption was positive during 2018 and overall asking lease rates increased year-over-year.\nIn Ventura County, vacancy increased year-over-year and asking lease rates increased year-over year.\nLastly, in the Inland Empire, new industrial product continues to be absorbed well in the market. In the Inland Empire West, which contains infill markets in which we operate, vacancy remained at historically low levels and asking lease rates were unchanged year-over-year. We expect the outlook for the Inland Empire West to remain positive over the upcoming year. We generally do not focus on properties located within the non-infill Inland Empire East sub-market where the development and construction pipeline for new supply is substantial.\nAcquisitions and Value-Add Repositioning of Properties\nThe Company's growth strategy comprises acquiring leased, stabilized properties as well as properties with value-add opportunities to improve functionality and to deploy our value-driven asset management programs in order to increase cash flow and value. Additionally, from time to time, we may acquire land parcels or properties with excess land where we may construct new buildings, although we do not anticipate this to be a substantial part of our operations. Acquisitions may comprise single property investments as well as the purchase of portfolios of properties, with transaction values ranging from sub-$10 million dollar single-property investments to portfolios potentially valued in the billions of dollars. The Company's geographic focus remains infill Southern California. However, from time-to-time, portfolios could be acquired comprising a critical mass of infill Southern California industrial property that could include some assets located in markets outside of infill Southern California. In general, to the extent non-infill-Southern California assets were to be acquired as part of a larger portfolio, the Company may underwrite such investments with the potential to dispose such assets over a certain period of time in order to maximize its core focus on infill Southern California, while endeavoring to take appropriate steps to satisfy REIT safe harbor requirements to avoid prohibited transactions under REIT tax laws.\nA key component of our growth strategy is to acquire properties through off-market and lightly marketed transactions that are often operating at below-market occupancy or below-market rent at the time of acquisition or that have near-term lease roll-over or that provide opportunities to add value through functional or physical repositioning and improvements.

In addition, we anticipate beginning repositioning work on two additional properties in early 2019.

At completion, the property will be one single-tenant building containing 56,306 rentable square feet. During 2018, we pre-leased the property and in January 2019 the tenant took possession of the property. \n (4) 9615 Norwalk is a 10.26 acre storage-yard with three buildings totaling 38,362 rentable square feet. In January 2019, we converted the tenant's month to month land lease to a term lease with an expiration date of June 30, 2020. We will \ndemolish the existing buildings and construct a new 201,808 rentable square foot building upon termination of the land lease.\n (5) As of December 31, 2018, we are repositioning space aggregating 109,129 rentable square feet at 3233 Mission Oaks. During the first quarter of 2018, we completed the repositioning of a 43,927 rentable square foot unit at 3233 Mission Oaks. \n (6) We plan to reposition a 36,000 rentable square foot unit at 7110 Rosecrans Avenue when the current lease expires in the first quarter of 2019. \n (7) We consider a repositioning property to be stabilized at the earlier of the following: (i) upon reaching 90% occupancy or (ii) one year from the date of completion of repositioning construction work.  Properties that are nonoperational as a result of repositioning or redevelopment activity may qualify for varying levels of interest, insurance and real estate tax capitalization during the development and construction period. An increase in our repositioning and development activities resulting from value-add acquisitions could cause an increase in the asset balances qualifying for interest, insurance and tax capitalization in future periods. We capitalized $2.1 million of interest expense and $0.9 million of insurance and real estate tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2018, related to our repositioning and redevelopment projects.\nRental Revenue\nOur operating results depend primarily upon generating rental revenue from the properties in our consolidated portfolio. The amount of rental revenue generated by these properties is affected by our ability to maintain or increase occupancy levels and rental rates at our properties, which will depend upon our ability to lease vacant space and re-lease expiring space at favorable rates.\nOccupancy Rates\nAs of December 31, 2018, our consolidated portfolio was 95.4% occupied. We believe the opportunity to increase occupancy at our properties will be an important driver of future revenue growth. An opportunity to drive this growth will derive from the lease-up of recently completed repositioning projects and the completion and lease-up of repositioning projects that are currently under construction and planned for near-term construction.\nAs summarized in the table above, as of December 31, 2018, 11 of our properties with a combined 0.5 million vacant rentable square feet, were in various stages of repositioning or lease-up. These 11 properties are concentrated in our Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego and Ventura markets, and represent 2.2% of our total consolidated portfolio square footage as of December 31, 2018. Including vacant repositioning and lease-up space at these 11 properties, our weighted average occupancy rate as of December 31, 2018, in Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego and Ventura was 96.1%, 95.1%, 95.2% and 88.6%, respectively. Excluding vacant repositioning and lease-up space at these 11 properties, our weighted average occupancy rate as of December 31, 2018, in these markets was 97.8%, 97.2%, 97.4% and 97.2%, respectively, and our overall portfolio occupancy excluding these properties was 97.5%. We believe that a significant portion of our long-term future growth will come from the completion of these projects currently under or scheduled for repositioning, as well as through the identification or acquisition of new opportunities for redevelopment and repositioning, whether in our existing portfolio or through new investments, which may vary from period to period subject to market conditions.\nThe occupancy rate of properties not undergoing repositioning is affected by regional and local economic conditions in our Southern California infill markets. Throughout 2018, the Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego county markets have continued to show historically low vacancy and positive absorption, resulting from high tenant demand combined with low product availability. Accordingly, our properties in these markets have exhibited a similar trend. We expect general market conditions to remain positive in 2019, and we believe the opportunity to increase occupancy and rental rates at our properties will be an important driver of future revenue growth.\nLeasing Activity and Rental Rates\nThe following tables set forth our leasing activity for new and renewal leases on a quarterly basis for the year ended December 31, 2018:\nTable 200:

square foot is the average base rent calculated in accordance with GAAP, over the term of the lease, expressed in dollars per square foot per year. Includes all new and renewal leases executed during each respective quarter. \n (2) Calculated as the change between GAAP rents for new or renewal leases and the expiring GAAP rents on the expiring leases for the same space. \n (3) Calculated as the change between cash rents for new or renewal leases and the expiring cash rents on the expiring leases for the same space. \n (4) The GAAP and cash re-leasing spreads for new leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2018, exclude 63 leases aggregating 719,616 rentable square feet for which there was no comparable lease data. Of these 63 excluded leases, 24 leases aggregating 444,613 rentable square feet are leases of recently repositioned space. Comparable leases generally exclude: (i) space that has never been occupied under our ownership, (ii) recently repositioned/redeveloped space, (iii) space that has been vacant for over one year or (iv) space with lease terms shorter than six months. \n (5) The GAAP and cash re-leasing rent spreads for renewal leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2018, exclude 11 leases aggregating 100,567 rentable square feet for which there was no comparable lease data due to either (i) space with different lease structures or (ii) space with lease terms shorter than six months. \n (6) Includes eight leases totaling 200,469 rentable square feet that expired during the year ended December 31, 2018, for which the space was placed into repositioning after each tenant vacated. \n (7) Retention is calculated as renewal lease square footage plus relocation/expansion square footage, divided by the square footage of leases expiring during the period. Retention excludes expiring leases associated with space that is placed into repositioning after the tenant vacates.  Our leasing activity is impacted both by our redevelopment and repositioning efforts, as well as by market conditions. While we reposition a property, its space may become unavailable for leasing until completion of our repositioning efforts. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we stabilized 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard - Unit H, 301-445 Figueroa Street and\n28903 Avenue Paine with a combined 289,512 rentable square feet and leased an additional 172,890 rentable square feet at 14748-14750 Nelson Avenue. Additionally, in January 2019 we completed and stabilized our development property located at 1998 Surveyor Avenue. As of the date of this filing, we have six incomplete repositioning and development projects with estimated construction completion periods ranging from the second quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of 2021 and four properties in the lease-up stage. We expect these properties to have positive impacts on our leasing activity and revenue generation as we complete our value-add repositioning plan and place these properties in service.\nScheduled Lease Expirations\nOur ability to re-lease space subject to expiring leases is affected by economic and competitive conditions in our markets and by the desirability of our individual properties, which may impact our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, 0.7 million rentable square feet of our portfolio was available for lease, 0.3 million rentable square feet of vacant space was under repositioning and leases representing 0.2 million rentable square feet of our portfolio expired on December 31, 2018. Additionally, leases representing 12.9% and 19.6% of the aggregate rentable square footage of our portfolio are scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we renewed 246 leases for 1.9 million rentable square feet, resulting in a 65.4% retention rate. Our retention rate during the year was impacted by our strategy to roll certain tenants at below-market rents and to replace them with higher quality tenants paying higher rents with minimal down time. New and renewal leases signed during the current year had a weighted average term of 4.8 and 3.5 years, respectively, and we expect future new and renewal leases to have similar terms.\nThe leases scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2020, represent 13.7% and 19.6%, respectively, of the total annualized base rent for our portfolio as of December 31, 2018. We estimate that, on a weighted average basis, in-place rents of leases scheduled to expire in 2019 and 2020 are currently below current market asking rents, although individual units or properties within any particular submarket presently may be leased either above, below, or at the current market asking rates within that submarket. As described in the above Market Fundamentals section, we expect market dynamics to remain strong heading into 2019 and that these positive trends will provide a favorable environment for additional increases in lease renewal rates. Accordingly, we expect 2019 will show positive renewal rates and leasing spreads. We also currently do not see any reason not to expect that 2020 lease expirations will show positive growth upon renewal; however, it is difficult to predict market conditions that far into the future.\nConditions in Our Markets\nThe properties in our portfolio are located primarily in Southern California infill markets. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in this market may affect our overall performance.\nProperty Expenses\nOur rental expenses generally consist of utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, site repair and maintenance costs, and the allocation of overhead costs. For the majority of our properties, our property expenses are recovered, in part, by either the triple net provisions or modified gross expense reimbursements in tenant leases. The majority of our leases also comprise contractual three percent annual rental rate increases meant, in part, to help mitigate potential increases in property expenses over time. However, the terms of our leases vary and, in some instances, we may absorb property expenses. Our overall financial results will be impacted by the extent to which we are able to pass-through property expenses to our tenants.\nTaxable REIT Subsidiary\nAs of December 31, 2018, our Operating Partnership indirectly and wholly owns Rexford Industrial Realty and Management, Inc., which we refer to as the services company. We have elected, together with our services company, to treat our services company as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary generally may provide non-customary and other services to our tenants and engage in activities that we may not engage in directly without adversely affecting our qualification as a REIT, provided a taxable REIT subsidiary may not operate or manage a lodging facility or health care facility or provide rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated. We may form additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future, and our Operating Partnership may contribute some or all of its interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries or their assets to our services company.
