MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nINTRODUCTION\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on and should be read in conjunction with \"Forward-Looking Information\", Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses 2019 and 2018 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. For discussion of 2017 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017, refer to Part II. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nCANADIAN LINE 3 REPLACEMENT PROGRAM PLACED INTO SERVICE\nThe Canadian Line 3 Replacement Program was placed into service on December 1, 2019, with an interim surcharge on Mainline System volumes of US$0.20 per barrel. This safety-driven maintenance project reflects the importance of protecting the environment and ensuring the continued safe and reliable operations of our Mainline System well into the future. For further details refer to Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects - Liquids Pipelines.\nSTATE OF MINNESOTA PERMITTING TIMELINE FOR U.S. LINE 3 REPLACEMENT PROGRAM\nOn June 3, 2019, the Minnesota Court of Appeals rendered a decision on the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission's (MNPUC's) adequacy determination of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the U.S. L3R Program. While denying eight of the nine appealed items, the Minnesota Court of Appeals identified one issue that led it to reverse the adequacy determination. On July 3, 2019, certain project opponents sought further appellate review from the Minnesota Supreme Court. On September 17, 2019, based on the respective responses of the MNPUC and the Company, the Minnesota Supreme Court denied the opponents' petitions thus restoring the MNPUC with jurisdiction. At a hearing on October 1, 2019, the MNPUC directed the Department of Commerce to submit a revised FEIS by December 9, 2019. The Department of Commerce issued the revised FEIS on December 9, 2019, and the MNPUC gathered public comment on that document through January 16, 2020. On February 3, 2020, the MNPUC approved the adequacy of the revised FEIS and reinstated the Certificate of Need and Route Permit, clearing the way for construction of the pipeline to commence following the issuance of required permits.\nAt this time, we cannot determine when all necessary permits to commence construction will be issued. For further details refer to Growth Projects - Regulatory Matters - United States Line 3 Replacement Program.\nMAINLINE SYSTEM CONTRACTING\nOn August 2, 2019, we launched an open season for transportation services on our Mainline System. The open season provided shippers with the opportunity to enter into long-term contracts for priority access on the Mainline System upon maturity of the current CTS agreement on June 30, 2021.\nOn September 27, 2019, after receiving complaints, the CER ordered that we may not offer firm service to prospective shippers on our Mainline System until such firm service, including all associated tolls and terms and conditions of service, has been approved by the CER. While this decision was a significant departure from past regulatory precedents, the CER noted that its decision to hold a regulatory review prior to the open season does not prejudice our ability to offer long term priority access contracts on the Mainline System.\nOn December 19, 2019, we submitted an application to the CER to implement contracting on our Mainline System. The application for contracted and uncommitted service included the associated terms, conditions and tolls of each service, which would be offered in an open season following approval by the CER. The tolls and services would replace the current CTS that is in place until June 30, 2021. If a replacement agreement is not in place by that time, the CTS tolls will continue on an interim basis.\nThe application that we filed is the result of over two years of extensive negotiations with a diverse group of shippers and has been designed to align the interests of us and our shippers. Shippers, which represent over 70 percent of our current Mainline System throughput, have filed letters supporting the application with the CER, demonstrating the strong shipper backing for the offering.\nOn February 7, 2020, we replied to the letters solicited by the CER regarding comments from interested parties both in opposition and support of our application. We expect a thorough regulatory process to continue through substantially all of 2020.\nASSET MONETIZATION\nEnbridge Gas New Brunswick Business\nOn October 1, 2019, we closed the sale of EGNB to Liberty Utilities (Canada) LP, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp., for proceeds of approximately $331 million.\nSt. Lawrence Gas Company Inc.\nOn November 1, 2019, we closed the sale of the issued and outstanding shares of St. Lawrence Gas for proceeds of approximately $72 million.\nCanadian Natural Gas Gathering and Processing Businesses\nOn December 31, 2019, we closed the sale of the federally regulated Canadian natural gas gathering and processing businesses to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. and its institutional partners (collectively, Brookfield) for proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion, after closing adjustments. These federally regulated businesses represent the second and final phase of the $4.3 billion transaction that was previously announced on July 4, 2018.\nMontana-Alberta Tie Line\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we committed to a plan to sell the MATL transmission assets. The purchase and sale agreement was signed in January 2020. Subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020.\nRefer to Liquidity and Capital Resources - Sources and Uses of Cash for details on the use of proceeds from our asset monetization activity discussed above.\nENBRIDGE GAS INC. 2019 RATE APPLICATION\nIn September 2019, Enbridge Gas received a Decision and Order from the OEB on its application for 2019 rates. The 2019 rate application was filed in December 2018 in accordance with the parameters of Enbridge Gas's OEB approved Price Cap Incentive Regulation rate setting mechanism and represents the first year of a five-year term. The Decision and Order approved an effective date for base rates of April 1, 2019, and the inclusion of incremental capital module amounts to allow for the recovery of incremental capital investments.\nENBRIDGE GAS INC. 2020 RATE APPLICATION\nIn October 2019, Enbridge Gas filed an application with the OEB for the setting of rates for 2020 and for the funding of discrete incremental capital investments through the incremental capital module mechanism. The 2020 rate application was filed in accordance with the parameters of Enbridge Gas' OEB approved Price Cap Incentive Regulation rate setting mechanism and represents the second year of a five-year term. In December 2019, Enbridge Gas received a Decision and Order from the OEB which approved 2020 rates on an interim basis effective January 1, 2020. A decision on Enbridge Gas' application for incremental capital module amounts is expected in the second quarter of 2020.\nTEXAS EASTERN PIPELINE RUPTURE\nOn August 1, 2019, a rupture occurred on Line 15, a 30-inch natural gas pipeline that is a component of the Texas Eastern natural gas pipeline system in Lincoln County, Kentucky. While the two adjacent pipelines have been returned to service, Line 15 remains shut down in the affected area and the timeline for its return to service has not yet been determined. There was one fatality. We are continuing to support the National Transportation Safety Board in its investigation, the community and the community members who were impacted by the rupture. The Texas Eastern natural gas pipeline system extends approximately 1,700 miles from producing fields in the Gulf Coast region of Texas and Louisiana to Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York.\nDue to the incident, before expected recoveries, we experienced lower revenues and higher operating costs of $34 million in 2019. Texas Eastern Transmission, LP (Texas Eastern) is included in a comprehensive insurance program that is maintained for our subsidiaries and affiliates, which includes liability, property and business interruption insurance.\nTEXAS EASTERN RATE CASE\nOn June 1, 2019, Texas Eastern put into effect its updated rates. These increased recourse rates are subject to refund and interest. Following extensive negotiations on the Texas Eastern rate case, we reached an agreement with shippers and filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the FERC on October 28, 2019. On January 13, 2020, the Administrative Law Judge certified this uncontested Stipulation and Agreement to the FERC and we expect a decision from the FERC in the second quarter of 2020. Upon receipt of a decision from the FERC we will begin recognizing updated rates within our results of operations.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

value gains and losses discussed above generally arise as a result of a comprehensive long-term economic hedging program to mitigate interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity price risks. This program creates volatility in reported short-term earnings through the recognition of unrealized non-cash gains and losses on financial derivative instruments used to hedge these risks. Over the long-term, we believe our hedging program supports the reliable cash flows and dividend growth upon which our investor value proposition is based.\nAfter taking into consideration the factors above, the remaining $773 million increase in Earnings Attributable to Common Shareholders is primarily explained by the following significant business factors:\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increased earnings from our Liquids Pipelines segment due to higher Flanagan South, Seaway Pipeline and Bakken Pipeline System throughput year-over-year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>stronger contributions from our Liquids Pipelines segment due to a higher IJT Benchmark Toll and higher Mainline System ex-Gretna throughput driven by an increase in supply and continuous capacity optimization;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>contributions from new Gas Transmission and Midstream assets placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2019;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increased earnings from our Gas Distribution and Storage segment due to colder weather experienced in our franchise areas, higher distribution rates and customer base, and the absence in 2019 of earnings sharing which was recognized in 2018;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increased earnings from our Energy Services segment due to the widening of certain location and quality differentials during the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, which increased opportunities to generate profitable transportation margins that were realized during 2019;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>lower earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2019 following the completion of the Sponsored Vehicles buy-in in the fourth quarter of 2018; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the net favorable effect of translating United States dollar EBITDA at a higher Canadian to United States dollar average exchange rate (Average Exchange Rate) of $1.33 in 2019 compared with $1.30 in 2018, partially offset by realized losses arising from our foreign exchange risk management program.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe positive business factors above were partially offset by the following:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the absence in 2019 of earnings from MOLP and the provincially regulated portion of our Canadian natural gas gathering and processing businesses which were sold in the second half of 2018;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>higher operating costs on our Gas Transmission and Midstream assets primarily due to higher pipeline integrity costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>higher depreciation and amortization expense as a result of placing new assets into service, partially offset by depreciation no longer recorded for assets which were classified as held for sale or sold during the second half of 2018; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>higher income tax expense due to higher earnings, the buy-in of our United States sponsored vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2018 and lower foreign tax rate differentials in 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nREVENUES\nWe generate revenues from three primary sources: transportation and other services, gas distribution sales and commodity sales.\nTransportation and other services revenues of $16,555 million, $14,358 million and $13,877 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were earned from our crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation businesses and also include power generation revenues from our portfolio of renewable and power generation assets. For our transportation assets operating under market-based arrangements, revenues are driven by volumes transported and the corresponding tolls for transportation services. For assets operating under take-or-pay contracts, revenues reflect the terms of the underlying contract for services or capacity. For rate-regulated assets, revenues are charged in accordance with tolls established by the regulator, and in most cost-of-service based arrangements are reflective of our cost to provide the service plus a regulator-approved rate of return. Higher transportation and other services revenues reflected increased throughput on our core liquids pipeline assets combined with the incremental revenues associated with assets placed into service over the past three years.\nGas distribution sales revenues of $4,205 million, $4,360 million and $4,215 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were recognized in a manner consistent with the underlying rate-setting mechanism mandated by the regulator. Revenues generated by the gas distribution businesses are primarily driven by volumes delivered, which vary with weather and customer composition and utilization, as well as regulator-approved rates. The cost of natural gas is passed through to customers through rates and does not ultimately impact earnings due to its flow-through nature.\nCommodity sales of $29,309 million, $27,660 million and $26,286 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were generated primarily through our Energy Services operations. Energy Services includes the contemporaneous purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas, power and Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) to generate a margin, which is typically a small fraction of gross revenue. While sales revenue generated from these operations are impacted by commodity prices, net margins and earnings are relatively insensitive to commodity prices and reflect activity levels which are driven by differences in commodity prices between locations, grades and points in time, rather than on absolute prices. Any residual commodity margin risk is closely monitored and managed. Revenues from these operations depend on activity levels, which vary from year-to-year depending on market conditions and commodity prices.\nOur revenues also include changes in unrealized derivative fair value gains and losses related to foreign exchange and commodity price contracts used to manage exposures from movements in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. The mark-to-market accounting creates volatility and impacts the comparability of revenues in the short-term, but we believe over the long-term, the economic hedging program supports reliable cash flows.\nDIVIDENDS\nWe have paid common share dividends in every year since we became a publicly traded company in 1953. In December 2019, we announced a 9.8 percent increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.81 per common share, or $3.24 annualized, effective with the dividend payable on March 1, 2020.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nLIQUIDS PIPELINES\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(millions of Canadian dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>7,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared with year ended December 31, 2018\nEBITDA was positively impacted by $1,926 million due to certain unusual, infrequent or other non-operating factors, primarily explained by the following:\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a non-cash, unrealized gain of $976 million in 2019 compared with a loss of $1,077 million in 2018 reflecting net fair value gains and losses arising from changes in the mark-to-market value of derivative financial instruments used to manage foreign exchange and commodity price risks;

While denying eight of the nine issues on appeal, the Minnesota Court of Appeals identified one issue that led it to reverse the adequacy determination. The Minnesota Court of Appeals remanded and directed the MNPUC to perform spill modeling analysis within the Lake Superior Watershed. On July 3, 2019, certain project opponents sought further appellate review from the Minnesota Supreme Court. On September 17, 2019, based on the respective responses of the MNPUC and the Company, the Minnesota Supreme Court denied the opponents' petitions thus restoring the MNPUC with jurisdiction. At a hearing on October 1, 2019, the MNPUC directed the Department of Commerce to submit a revised FEIS by December 9, 2019. The Department of Commerce issued the revised FEIS on December 9, 2019 and the MNPUC gathered public comment on that document through January 16, 2020. On February 3, 2020, the MNPUC approved the adequacy of the revised FEIS and reinstated the Certificate of Need and Route Permit, clearing the way for construction of the pipeline to commence following the issuance of required permits.\nAs for environmental permits, the spill modeling required by the Minnesota Court of Appeals is a prerequisite to finalizing other state permits. On September 27, 2019, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) issued a denial without prejudice of the U.S. L3R Program's 401 Water Quality Certification (WQC). This action was expected since the MPCA is prohibited by state law from issuing a final 401 WQC until the FEIS is found to be adequate by the MNPUC. On November 15, 2019, we submitted a revised 401 WQC to the MPCA. The MPCA is expected to release a draft of the revised 401 WQC on February 26, 2020, and a 30-day public comment period is expected to begin on March 2, 2020.\nAt this time, we cannot determine when all necessary permits to commence construction will be issued. Depending on the final in-service date, there is a risk that the project may exceed our total cost estimate of $9 billion for the combined Line 3 Replacement Program. However, at this time, we do not anticipate any capital cost impacts that would be material to our financial position and outlook.\nOTHER ANNOUNCED PROJECTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT\nThe following projects have been announced by us, but have not yet met our criteria to be classified as commercially secured:\nLIQUIDS PIPELINES\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Sea Port Oil Terminal Project - the Sea Port Oil Terminal (SPOT) project consists of onshore and offshore facilities, including a fixed platform located approximately 30 miles off the coast of Brazoria County, Texas.

Access to timely funding from capital markets could be limited by factors outside our control, including but not limited to financial market volatility resulting from economic and political events both inside and outside North America. To mitigate such risks, we actively manage financial plans and strategies to ensure we maintain sufficient liquidity to meet routine operating and future capital requirements. In the near term, we generally expect to utilize cash from operations together with commercial paper issuance and/or credit facility draws and the proceeds of capital market offerings to fund liabilities as they become due, finance capital expenditures, fund debt retirements and pay common and preference share dividends. We target to maintain sufficient liquidity through securement of committed credit facilities with a diversified group of banks and financial institutions to enable us to fund all anticipated requirements for approximately one year without accessing the capital markets.\nOur financing plan is regularly updated to reflect evolving capital requirements and financial market conditions and identifies a variety of potential sources of debt and equity funding alternatives. Our current financing plan does not include any issuances of additional common equity and was the leading principle behind the suspension of our Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan in November 2018.\nCAPITAL MARKET ACCESS\nWe ensure ready access to capital markets, subject to market conditions, through maintenance of shelf prospectuses that allow for issuance of long-term debt, equity and other forms of long-term capital when market conditions are attractive. In accordance with our funding plan we completed the following issuances in 2019:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Entity\n</td> <td>Type of Issuance\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions of Canadian dollars, unless stated otherwise)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Enbridge Inc.\n</td> <td>Medium-term notes\n</td> <td>$1,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Enbridge Inc.\n</td> <td>US$ senior notes\n</td> <td>US$2,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Enbridge Gas Inc.\n</td> <td>Medium-term notes\n</td> <td>$700\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Enbridge Pipelines Inc.\n</td> <td>Medium-term notes\n</td> <td>$1,200\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spectra Energy Partners, LP1\n</td> <td>US$ senior notes\n</td> <td>US$500\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>Issued through Algonquin Gas Transmission, LLC, an operating subsidiary of Spectra Energy Partners, LP (SEP).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Facilities, Ratings and Liquidity\nTo ensure ongoing liquidity and to mitigate the risk of capital market disruption, we maintain ready access to funds through committed bank credit facilities and actively manage our bank funding sources to optimize pricing and other terms.

As a result, our total credit facility availability increased by approximately $444 million.\nOn May 16, 2019, Enbridge Inc. entered into a three year, non-revolving, extendible credit facility for $641 million (\u00a552.5 billion) with a syndicate of Japanese banks.\nOn July 18, 2019, Enbridge Inc. entered into a five year, non-revolving, bilateral credit facility for $500 million with an Asian bank.\nIn addition to the committed credit facilities noted above, we have $916 million of uncommitted demand facilities, of which $476 million were unutilized as at December 31, 2019. As at December 31, 2018, we had $807 million of uncommitted credit facilities, of which $548 million were unutilized.\nAs at December 31, 2019 and 2018, our net available liquidity totaled $9,901 million and $9,409 million, respectively. As at December 31, 2019, the liquidity was inclusive of $648 million of unrestricted Cash and cash equivalents as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position (2018 - $518 million).\nOur credit facility agreements and term debt indentures include standard events of default and covenant provisions, whereby accelerated repayment and/or termination of the agreements may result if we were to default on payment or violate certain covenants. As at December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all debt covenants and expect to continue to comply with such covenants.\nStrong growth in internal cash flow, proceeds from non-core asset dispositions, ready access to liquidity from diversified sources and a stable business model have enabled us to manage our credit profile. We actively monitor and manage key financial metrics with the objective of sustaining investment grade credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies and ongoing access to bank funding and term debt capital on attractive terms. Key measures of financial strength that are closely managed include the ability to service debt obligations from operating cash flow and the ratio of debt to EBITDA.\nDuring 2019, our credit ratings were affirmed as follows:\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On July 23, 2019, DBRS Limited affirmed our issuer rating and medium-term notes and unsecured debentures rating of BBB (high), fixed-to-floating subordinated notes rating of BBB (low), preference share rating of Pfd-3 (high) and commercial paper rating of R-2 (high), all with stable outlooks.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On April 15, 2019, Fitch Rating services affirmed long-term issuer default rating and senior unsecured debt rating of BBB+, preference share rating of BBB-, junior subordinated note rating of BBB-, and short-term and commercial paper rating of with a stable rating outlook.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On January 25, 2019, Moody's Investor Services, Inc. upgraded our issuer and senior unsecured ratings from Baa3 to Baa2 with outlook revised to positive, upgraded our subordinated rating from Ba2 to Ba1, preference share rating from Ba2 to Ba1 and the commercial paper rating for Enbridge (U.S.) Inc. from P-3 to P-2.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On December 30, 2019, Standard & Poor's Rating Services (S&P) affirmed our corporate credit rating and senior unsecured debt rating of BBB+, preference share rating of P-2 (low) and commercial paper rating of A-1 (low), and reaffirmed a stable outlook.

Total restricted cash of $28 million, as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, primarily includes cash collateral and amounts received in respect of specific shipper commitments. Cash and cash equivalents held by certain subsidiaries may not be readily accessible for alternative use by us.\nExcluding current maturities of long-term debt, as at December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had a negative working capital position of $2,781 million and $3,024 million, respectively. In both periods, the major contributing factor to the negative working capital position was the current liabilities associated with our growth capital program.\nTo address this negative working capital position, we maintain significant liquidity in the form of committed credit facilities and other sources as previously discussed, which enable the funding of liabilities as they become due.\nSOURCES AND USES OF CASH\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31,\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(millions of Canadian dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>9,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(4,658\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3,017\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(11,037\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(4,745\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(7,503\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>3,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of translation of foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(975\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSignificant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are summarized below:\nOperating Activities\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The decrease in cash flow provided by operations during 2019 was primarily driven by changes in operating assets and liabilities.

These arrangements include financial guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 31. Guarantees for further discussion of guarantee arrangements.\nMost of the guarantee arrangements that we enter into enhance the credit standings of certain subsidiaries, non-consolidated entities or less than 100%-owned entities, enabling them to conduct business. As such, these guarantee arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk which are not included on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The possibility of us having to honor our contingencies is largely dependent upon the future operations of our subsidiaries, investees and other third parties, or the occurrence of certain future events. Issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of our operations.\nWe do not have material off-balance sheet financing entities or structures, except for normal operating lease arrangements, guarantee arrangements and financings entered into by our equity investments. For additional information on these commitments, see Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 30. Commitments and Contingencies and Note 31. Guarantees.\nWe do not have material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nPayments due under contractual obligations over the next five years and thereafter are as follows:\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As at December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(millions of Canadian dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual debt maturities1\n</td> <td>63,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest obligations2\n</td> <td>29,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land leases\n</td> <td>1,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension obligations3\n</td> <td>135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term contracts4\n</td> <td>9,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities5\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>104,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>Includes debentures, term notes, commercial paper and credit facility draws based on the facility's maturity date and excludes short-term borrowings, debt discount, debt issue costs and finance lease obligations.

On September 7, 2018, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania granted Eddystone Rail's motion to amend its complaint to add several affiliates of the corporate defendants as additional defendants (the Amended Complaint). Eddystone Rail's chances of success on its Amended Complaint cannot be predicted at this time. Defendants have filed Answers and Counterclaims which, together with subsequent amendments, seek damages from Eddystone Rail in excess of US$32 million. The defendants' chances of success on their counterclaims cannot be predicted at this time. The non-corporate defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss on October 25, 2019, based on alleged lack of standing. The motion has been fully briefed to the Court and decision is pending. The individual defendants' chances of success on this motion cannot be predicted at this time.\nDakota Access Pipeline\nIn February 2017, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe filed motions with the United States Court for the District of Columbia contesting the validity of the process used by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (Army Corps) to permit the Dakota Access Pipeline. The Oglala Sioux and Yankton Sioux Tribes also filed claims in the case to challenge the Army Corps permit and environmental review process. In August 2018, in response to a Court order to reconsider components of its environmental analysis, the Army Corps issued its decision that no supplemental environmental analysis was required. All four Tribes have since amended their complaints to include claims challenging the adequacy of the Army Corps' supplemental environmental analysis. The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment with the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on the merits of the plaintiffs claims challenging the adequacy of the Army Corps' remand process. Briefing on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment was completed on November 25, 2019. These cross-motions remain pending for decision before the District Court.\nLine 5 Dual Pipelines\nIn December 2018, Michigan law PA 359 was enacted which created the Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority (Corridor Authority) and authorized an agreement between us and the Corridor Authority for the construction of a tunnel under the Straits of Mackinac (Straits) to house a replacement for the Line 5 Dual Pipelines that currently cross the Straits (the Tunnel Project). On December 19, 2018, we entered into a Tunnel Project agreement with the Government of Michigan. On March 28, 2019, the Michigan Attorney General issued an opinion finding the Michigan law PA 359 unconstitutional and soon after, Michigan Governor Whitmer issued a directive to Michigan agencies to cease any action implementing the statute.\nTo resolve the legal uncertainty created by the Michigan Attorney General's opinion and the directive issued by Michigan Governor Whitmer, on June 6, 2019, we filed a complaint with the Michigan Court of Claims to establish the constitutional validity of Michigan law PA 359 and enforceability of various agreements entered into between us and the State of Michigan related to the construction of the Tunnel Project. On June 11, 2019, State officials confirmed that we had valid permits to conduct specified geotechnical work which has now been completed. This work was necessary to prepare for Tunnel Project construction. On June 27, 2019, the Michigan Attorney General requested the Michigan Court of Claims to dismiss our complaint and we opposed her request with our response filed on August 1, 2019. On October 31, 2019, the Michigan Court of Claims determined that Michigan law PA 359 is valid and is not unconstitutional. On November 5, 2019 the Michigan Attorney General filed an appeal of this decision. According to the expedited appeal schedule, briefing is anticipated to be completed in March 2020 with a decision expected later in 2020.\nOn June 27, 2019, the Michigan Attorney General filed a complaint in the Michigan Ingham County Circuit Court that requests the Court to declare the easement that we have for the operation of the dual pipelines in the Straits to be invalid and to prohibit continued operation of the dual pipelines in the Straits as soon as possible after a reasonable notice period to allow orderly adjustments by affected parties\u201d. We continue to vigorously defend this action and on September 16, 2019, we filed our motion for summary disposition and requested dismissal of the State's Complaint in its entirety. On that same date, the State filed a motion for partial summary disposition and judgment in its favor on its claim that the easement was void from inception. The case is now fully briefed. Oral argument on the parties' motions has been scheduled for May 22, 2020.\nLine 5 Easement\nFor over six years, we have been in negotiations and discussions with the Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians (the Band) to resolve the Band's concerns over our Line 5 pipeline and right-of-way across the Bad River Reservation (the Reservation). Only a small portion of the total easements across 12 miles of the Reservation are at issue. These negotiations and discussions did not resolve the Band's concerns. On July 23, 2019, the Band filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin alleging that our continued use of Line 5 to transport crude oil and related liquids across the Reservation is a public nuisance under federal and state law and also alleging that the pipeline is in trespass on certain tracts of land in which the Band possesses undivided ownership interests. The Band also seeks an order prohibiting us from using Line 5 to transport crude oil and related liquids across the Reservation and requiring removal of the pipeline from the Reservation. On September 24, 2019, in response to the Band's complaint, we filed an answer, defenses, and counterclaims against the Band, as well as a motion to dismiss. On October 15, 2019, the Band filed its first amended complaint against us, adding new assertions about allegedly unsafe conditions at a specific location of the pipeline on the Reservation and requesting a declaration by the court that the Band has regulatory authority over Line 5. On October 29, 2019, we filed our response, defenses and counterclaims to the Band's first amended complaint. A trial date has been set for July 2021.\nThe Band has not sought a temporary injunction to immediately discontinue operation of Line 5. However, if successful, the Band's lawsuit could impact our ability to operate the pipeline on the Reservation. We have been vigorously defending the Band's action since it was filed and will continue to do so. Nevertheless, we also plan to continue working with the Band in an effort to address its concerns, and at the same time, as a contingency measure, we have begun taking steps to enable the construction of a reroute of Line 5 around the Reservation. To that end, we have identified a proposed route outside the Reservation and, on February 7, 2020, we initiated the permitting process for the proposed reroute by filing applications with federal and state regulatory authorities.\nGAS TRANSMMISSION\nDCP Midstream, LP Definitive Agreement and Equity Restructuring\nOn November 6, 2019 DCP Midstream, LP (DCP MLP) announced the execution of a definitive agreement with its general partner, in which we indirectly own a 50% equity interest, and the concurrent closing of an equity restructuring transaction. The transaction resulted in the general partner converting all of its incentive distribution rights in DCP MLP, which were eliminated, and its 2% economic general partner interest in DCP MLP, while retaining a non-economic general partner interest, into newly-issued DCP MLP common units. As a result of this transaction, we increased our indirect ownership of outstanding DCP MLP common units from approximately 18% to approximately 28%, while retaining our indirect 50% ownership interest in the general partner of DCP MLP.\nOTHER LITIGATION\nWe and our subsidiaries are involved in various other legal and regulatory actions and proceedings which arise in the normal course of business, including interventions in regulatory proceedings and challenges to regulatory approvals and permits. While the final outcome of such actions and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the resolution of such actions and proceedings will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nTAX MATTERS\nWe and our subsidiaries maintain tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions. While fully supportable in our view, these tax positions, if challenged by tax authorities, may not be fully sustained on review.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. In making judgments and estimates, management relies on external information and observable conditions, where possible, supplemented by internal analysis as required. We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below have an impact across the various segments of our business.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe apply the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805 Business Combinations in accounting for our acquisitions. The acquired long-lived assets, intangible assets and assumed liabilities are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition, as well as any contingent consideration, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.\nAccounting for business combinations requires significant judgment, estimates and assumptions at the acquisition date. In developing estimates of fair values at the acquisition date, we utilize a variety of factors including market data, historical and future expected cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. The subjective nature of our assumptions increases the risk associated with estimates surrounding the projected performance of the acquired entity.\nOn February 27, 2017, we acquired Spectra Energy for a purchase price of $37.5 billion. In determining the valuation of tangible assets acquired, we applied the cost, market and income approaches. For intangible assets acquired, we used an income approach which included cash flow projections based on historical performance, terms found in contracts and assumptions on expected renewals. Discount rates used in the valuation were also developed using a weighted-average cost of capital based on risks specific to respective assets and returns that an investor would likely require given the expected cash flows, timing and risk.\nGoodwill Impairment\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets on acquisition of a business. The carrying value of goodwill, which is not amortized, is assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances arise that suggest the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired.\nWe perform our annual review for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete information is available, whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components and whether the economic and regulatory characteristics are similar.\nWe have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. When performing a qualitative assessment, we determine the drivers of fair value for each reporting unit and evaluate whether those drivers have been positively or negatively affected by relevant events and circumstances since the last fair value assessment. Our evaluation includes, but is not limited to, assessment of macroeconomic trends, regulatory environments, capital accessibility, operating income trends, and industry conditions. Based on our assessment of the qualitative factors, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than it's carrying amount, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed.\nThe quantitative goodwill impairment test involves determining the fair value of our reporting units and comparing those values to the carrying value of each corresponding reporting unit. If the carrying value of a reporting unit, including allocated goodwill, exceeds its fair value, goodwill impairment is measured at the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value. This amount should not exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Fair value of our reporting units is estimated using a combination of discounted cash flow model and earnings multiples techniques. The determination of fair value using the discounted cash flow model technique requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to discount rates, projected operating income, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures and working capital levels. The cash flow projections included significant judgments and assumptions relating to revenue growth rates and expected future capital expenditure. The determination of fair value using the earnings multiples technique requires assumptions to be made in relation to maintainable earnings and earnings multipliers for reporting units.\nOur most recent annual review of the goodwill balance was performed on April 1, 2019, and this review did not result in an impairment charge. As at April 1, 2019, our reporting units were equivalent to our reportable segments, except for the Gas Transmission and Midstream reportable segment which was divided at the component level into two reporting units: Gas Transmission and Gas Midstream. We performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test of our Gas Midstream reporting unit. We elected to perform qualitative assessments of our Liquids Pipelines, Gas Distribution and Storage, and Gas Transmission and Midstream reporting units and concluded it was not more likely than not that these reporting units were impaired and that quantitative impairment tests were not necessary.\nThe allocation of goodwill to held for sale and disposed businesses is based on the fair value of businesses relative to their corresponding reporting unit. During the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, we impaired nil and $1,019 million, respectively, of goodwill allocated to assets held for sale.\nAsset Impairment\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our property, plant and equipment when events or circumstances such as economic obsolescence, business climate, legal or regulatory changes, or other factors indicate we may not recover the carrying amount of our assets. We continually monitor our businesses, the market and business environments to identify indicators that could suggest an asset may not be recoverable. If it is determined that the carrying value of an asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, we will assess the fair value of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value as determined by quoted market prices in active markets or present value techniques. The determination of the fair value using present value techniques requires the use of projections and assumptions regarding future cash flows and weighted average cost of capital. Any changes to these projections and assumptions could result in revisions to the evaluation of the recoverability of the property, plant and equipment and the recognition of an impairment loss in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nAssets held for sale\nWe classify assets as held for sale when management commits to a formal plan to actively market an asset or a group of assets and when management believes it is probable the sale of the assets will occur within one year. We measure assets classified as held for sale at the lower of their carrying value and their estimated fair value less costs to sell.\nRegulatory Accounting\nCertain of our businesses are subject to regulation by various authorities, including but not limited to, the CER, the FERC, the Alberta Energy Regulator, La R\u00e9gie de l'energie du Qu\u00e9bec and the OEB. Regulatory bodies exercise statutory authority over matters such as construction, rates and ratemaking and agreements with customers. To recognize the economic effects of the actions of the regulator, the timing of recognition of certain revenues and expenses in these operations may differ from that otherwise expected under U.S. GAAP for non-rate-regulated entities. Key determinants in the ratemaking process are:\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Costs of providing service, including operating costs, capital invested and depreciation expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Allowed rate of return, including the equity component of the capital structure and related income taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Interest costs on the debt component of the capital structure; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Contract and volume throughput assumptions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe allowed rate of return is determined in accordance with the applicable regulatory model and may impact our profitability. The rates for a number of our projects are based on a cost-of-service recovery model that follows the regulators' authoritative guidance. Under the cost-of-service tolling methodology, we calculate tolls based on forecast volumes and cost. A difference between forecast and actual results causes an over or under recovery in any given year. Regulatory assets represent amounts that are expected to be recovered from customers in future periods through rates. Regulatory liabilities represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future periods through rates or expected to be paid to cover future abandonment costs in relation to the CER's Land Matters Consultation Initiative (LMCI) and for future removal and site restoration costs as approved by the OEB.\nTo the extent that the regulator's actions differ from our expectations, the timing and amount of recovery or settlement of regulatory balances could differ significantly from those recorded. In the absence of rate regulation, we would generally not recognize regulatory assets or liabilities and the earnings impact would be recorded in the period the expenses are incurred or revenues are earned. A regulatory asset or liability is recognized in respect of deferred income taxes when it is expected the amounts will be recovered or settled through future regulator-approved rates.\nAs at December 31, 2019 and 2018, our significant regulatory assets totaled $4,800 million and $4,695 million, respectively, and significant regulatory liabilities totaled $2,786 million and $2,363 million, respectively.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment, our largest asset with a net book value at December 31, 2019 and 2018, of $93,723 million and $94,540 million, respectively, is charged in accordance with two primary methods. For distinct assets, depreciation is generally provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets commencing when the asset is placed in service. For largely homogeneous groups of assets with comparable useful lives, the pool method of accounting is followed whereby similar assets are grouped and depreciated as a pool. When group assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, gains and losses are not reflected in earnings but are booked as an adjustment to accumulated depreciation.\nWhen it is determined that the estimated service life of an asset no longer reflects the expected remaining period of benefit, prospective changes are made to the estimated service life. Estimates of useful lives are based on third party engineering studies, experience and/or industry practice. There are a number of assumptions inherent in estimating the service lives of our assets including the level of development, exploration, drilling, reserves and production of crude oil and natural gas in the supply areas served by our pipelines as well as the demand for crude oil and natural gas and the integrity of our systems. Changes in these assumptions could result in adjustments to the estimated service lives, which could result in material changes to depreciation expense in future periods in any of our business segments. For certain rate-regulated operations, depreciation rates are approved by the regulator and the regulator may require periodic studies or technical updates on useful lives which may change depreciation rates.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nWe use certain assumptions relating to the calculation of defined benefit pension and other postretirement liabilities and net periodic benefit costs. These assumptions comprise management's best estimates of expected return on plan assets, future salary levels, other cost escalations, retirement ages of employees and other actuarial factors including discount rates and mortality. We determine discount rates by reference to rates of high-quality long-term corporate bonds with maturities that approximate the timing of future payments anticipated to be made under each of the respective plans. The expected return on plan assets is determined using market-related values and assumptions on the asset mix consistent with the investment policy relating to the assets and their projected returns. The assumptions are reviewed annually by our independent actuaries. Actual results that differ from results based on assumptions are amortized over future periods and therefore could materially affect the expense recognized and the recorded obligation in future periods.\nThe following sensitivity analysis identifies the impact on the December 31, 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements of a 0.5% change in key pension and OPEB assumptions:\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Canada\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>United States\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(millions of Canadian dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in discount rate\n</td> <td>368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in expected return on assets\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in rate of salary increase\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPEB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in discount rate\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in expected return on assets\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContingent Liabilities\nProvisions for claims filed against us are determined on a case-by-case basis. Case estimates are reviewed on a regular basis and are updated as new information is received. The process of evaluating claims involves the use of estimates and a high degree of management judgment. Claims outstanding, the final determination of which could have a material impact on our financial results and certain subsidiaries and investments are detailed in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 30. Commitments and Contingencies. In addition, any unasserted claims that later may become evident could have a material impact on our financial results and certain subsidiaries and investments.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nARO associated with the retirement of long-lived assets are measured at fair value and recognized as Accounts payable and other or Other long-term liabilities in the period in which they can be reasonably determined. The fair value approximates the cost a third party would charge to perform the tasks necessary to retire such assets and is recognized at the present value of expected future cash flows. Discount rates used to estimate the present value of the expected future cash flows range from 1.8% to 9.0% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. ARO is added to the carrying value of the associated asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. The corresponding liability is accreted over time through charges to earnings and is reduced by actual costs of decommissioning and reclamation. Our estimates of retirement costs could change as a result of changes in cost estimates and regulatory requirements. Currently, for the majority of our assets, there is insufficient data or information to reasonably determine the timing of settlement for estimating the fair value of the ARO. In these cases, the ARO cost is considered indeterminate for accounting purposes, as there is no data or information that can be derived from past practice, industry practice or the estimated economic life of the asset.\nIn 2009, the CER issued a decision related to the LMCI, which required holders of an authorization to operate a pipeline under the CER Act to file a proposed process and mechanism to set aside funds to pay for future abandonment costs in respect of the sites in Canada used for the operation of a pipeline. The CER's decision stated that while pipeline companies are ultimately responsible for the full costs of abandoning pipelines, abandonment costs are a legitimate cost of providing service and are recoverable from the users of the pipeline upon approval by the CER. Following the CER's final approval of the collection mechanism and the set-aside mechanism for LMCI, we began collecting and setting aside funds to cover future abandonment costs effective January 1, 2015. The funds collected are held in trust in accordance with the CER decision. The funds collected from shippers are reported within Transportation and other services revenues and Restricted long-term investments. Concurrently, we reflect the future abandonment cost as an increase to Operating and administrative expense and Other long-term liabilities.\nCHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nRefer to Item 8.

"item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nINTRODUCTION\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on and should be read in conjunction with \"Forward-Looking Information\", Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses 2019 and 2018 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. For discussion of 2017 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017, refer to Part II. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nCANADIAN LINE 3 REPLACEMENT PROGRAM PLACED INTO SERVICE\nThe Canadian Line 3 Replacement Program was placed into service on December 1, 2019, with an interim surcharge on Mainline System volumes of US$0.20 per barrel. This safety-driven maintenance project reflects the importance of protecting the environment and ensuring the continued safe and reliable operations of our Mainline System well into the future. For further details refer to Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects - Liquids Pipelines.\nSTATE OF MINNESOTA PERMITTING TIMELINE FOR U.S. LINE 3 REPLACEMENT PROGRAM\nOn June 3, 2019, the Minnesota Court of Appeals rendered a decision on the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission's (MNPUC's) adequacy determination of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the U.S. L3R Program. While denying eight of the nine appealed items, the Minnesota Court of Appeals identified one issue that led it to reverse the adequacy determination. On July 3, 2019, certain project opponents sought further appellate review from the Minnesota Supreme Court. On September 17, 2019, based on the respective responses of the MNPUC and the Company, the Minnesota Supreme Court denied the opponents' petitions thus restoring the MNPUC with jurisdiction. At a hearing on October 1, 2019, the MNPUC directed the Department of Commerce to submit a revised FEIS by December 9, 2019. The Department of Commerce issued the revised FEIS on December 9, 2019, and the MNPUC gathered public comment on that document through January 16, 2020. On February 3, 2020, the MNPUC approved the adequacy of the revised FEIS and reinstated the Certificate of Need and Route Permit, clearing the way for construction of the pipeline to commence following the issuance of required permits.\nAt this time, we cannot determine when all necessary permits to commence construction will be issued. For further details refer to Growth Projects - Regulatory Matters - United States Line 3 Replacement Program.\nMAINLINE SYSTEM CONTRACTING\nOn August 2, 2019, we launched an open season for transportation services on our Mainline System. The open season provided shippers with the opportunity to enter into long-term contracts for priority access on the Mainline System upon maturity of the current CTS agreement on June 30, 2021.\nOn September 27, 2019, after receiving complaints, the CER ordered that we may not offer firm service to prospective shippers on our Mainline System until such firm service, including all associated tolls and terms and conditions of service, has been approved by the CER. While this decision was a significant departure from past regulatory precedents, the CER noted that its decision to hold a regulatory review prior to the open season does not prejudice our ability to offer long term priority access contracts on the Mainline System.\nOn December 19, 2019, we submitted an application to the CER to implement contracting on our Mainline System. The application for contracted and uncommitted service included the associated terms, conditions and tolls of each service, which would be offered in an open season following approval by the CER. The tolls and services would replace the current CTS that is in place until June 30, 2021. If a replacement agreement is not in place by that time, the CTS tolls will continue on an interim basis.\nThe application that we filed is the result of over two years of extensive negotiations with a diverse group of shippers and has been designed to align the interests of us and our shippers. Shippers, which represent over 70 percent of our current Mainline System throughput, have filed letters supporting the application with the CER, demonstrating the strong shipper backing for the offering.\nOn February 7, 2020, we replied to the letters solicited by the CER regarding comments from interested parties both in opposition and support of our application. We expect a thorough regulatory process to continue through substantially all of 2020.\nASSET MONETIZATION\nEnbridge Gas New Brunswick Business\nOn October 1, 2019, we closed the sale of EGNB to Liberty Utilities (Canada) LP, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp., for proceeds of approximately $331 million.\nSt. Lawrence Gas Company Inc.\nOn November 1, 2019, we closed the sale of the issued and outstanding shares of St. Lawrence Gas for proceeds of approximately $72 million.\nCanadian Natural Gas Gathering and Processing Businesses\nOn December 31, 2019, we closed the sale of the federally regulated Canadian natural gas gathering and processing businesses to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. and its institutional partners (collectively, Brookfield) for proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion, after closing adjustments. These federally regulated businesses represent the second and final phase of the $4.3 billion transaction that was previously announced on July 4, 2018.\nMontana-Alberta Tie Line\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we committed to a plan to sell the MATL transmission assets. The purchase and sale agreement was signed in January 2020. Subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020.\nRefer to Liquidity and Capital Resources - Sources and Uses of Cash for details on the use of proceeds from our asset monetization activity discussed above.\nENBRIDGE GAS INC. 2019 RATE APPLICATION\nIn September 2019, Enbridge Gas received a Decision and Order from the OEB on its application for 2019 rates. The 2019 rate application was filed in December 2018 in accordance with the parameters of Enbridge Gas's OEB approved Price Cap Incentive Regulation rate setting mechanism and represents the first year of a five-year term. The Decision and Order approved an effective date for base rates of April 1, 2019, and the inclusion of incremental capital module amounts to allow for the recovery of incremental capital investments.\nENBRIDGE GAS INC. 2020 RATE APPLICATION\nIn October 2019, Enbridge Gas filed an application with the OEB for the setting of rates for 2020 and for the funding of discrete incremental capital investments through the incremental capital module mechanism. The 2020 rate application was filed in accordance with the parameters of Enbridge Gas' OEB approved Price Cap Incentive Regulation rate setting mechanism and represents the second year of a five-year term. In December 2019, Enbridge Gas received a Decision and Order from the OEB which approved 2020 rates on an interim basis effective January 1, 2020. A decision on Enbridge Gas' application for incremental capital module amounts is expected in the second quarter of 2020.\nTEXAS EASTERN PIPELINE RUPTURE\nOn August 1, 2019, a rupture occurred on Line 15, a 30-inch natural gas pipeline that is a component of the Texas Eastern natural gas pipeline system in Lincoln County, Kentucky. While the two adjacent pipelines have been returned to service, Line 15 remains shut down in the affected area and the timeline for its return to service has not yet been determined. There was one fatality. We are continuing to support the National Transportation Safety Board in its investigation, the community and the community members who were impacted by the rupture. The Texas Eastern natural gas pipeline system extends approximately 1,700 miles from producing fields in the Gulf Coast region of Texas and Louisiana to Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York.\nDue to the incident, before expected recoveries, we experienced lower revenues and higher operating costs of $34 million in 2019. Texas Eastern Transmission, LP (Texas Eastern) is included in a comprehensive insurance program that is maintained for our subsidiaries and affiliates, which includes liability, property and business interruption insurance.\nTEXAS EASTERN RATE CASE\nOn June 1, 2019, Texas Eastern put into effect its updated rates. These increased recourse rates are subject to refund and interest. Following extensive negotiations on the Texas Eastern rate case, we reached an agreement with shippers and filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the FERC on October 28, 2019. On January 13, 2020, the Administrative Law Judge certified this uncontested Stipulation and Agreement to the FERC and we expect a decision from the FERC in the second quarter of 2020. Upon receipt of a decision from the FERC we will begin recognizing updated rates within our results of operations.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nEARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared with year ended December 31, 2018\nEarnings Attributable to Common Shareholders were net positively impacted by $2,034 million due to certain unusual, infrequent or other non-operating factors, primarily explained by the following:\n \u2022 a non-cash, unrealized derivative fair value gain of $1,806 million ($1,276 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2019, compared with a loss of $660 million ($397 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2018, reflecting net fair value gains and losses arising from changes in the mark-to-market value of derivative financial instruments used to manage foreign exchange and commodity prices risks; \n \u2022 a non-cash, write-down of crude oil and natural gas inventories to the lower of cost or market in our Energy Services business segment of $188 million ($144 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2019, compared with $327 million ($239 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2018; \n \u2022 the absence in 2019 of a goodwill impairment charge of $1,019 million after-tax attributable to us in 2018 resulting from the classification of our Canadian natural gas gathering and processing businesses as held for sale; \n \u2022 the absence in 2019 of a loss of $913 million ($701 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2018 on Midcoast Operating, L.P. and its subsidiaries (MOLP) resulting from a revision to the fair value of the assets held for sale based on the sale price; \n \u2022 the absence in 2019 of a loss of $154 million ($95 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2018 related to the Line 10 crude oil pipeline, which is a component of our Mainline System, resulting from its classification as an asset held for sale and the subsequent measurement at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell; and \n \u2022 employee severance, transition and transformation costs of $140 million ($127 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2019, compared with $203 million ($181 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2018. \nThe positive factors above were partially offset by the following unusual, infrequent or other non-operating factors:\n \u2022 a loss of $467 million after-tax attributable to us in 2019 ($268 million loss on sale and $199 million tax expense) resulting from the sale of the federally regulated portion of our Canadian natural gas gathering and processing businesses; \n \u2022 a loss of $310 million ($229 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2019 resulting from the review of our comprehensive long-term economic hedging program and a payment to certain hedge counterparties to pre-settle and reset the hedge rate on a portion of our hedging program; \n \u2022 a loss of $297 million ($218 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2019 resulting from the classification of our MATL assets as held for sale and the subsequent measurement at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell; \n \u2022 a loss of $105 million ($79 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2019 resulting from the write-off of project costs related to the Access Northeast pipeline project; \n \u2022 a loss of $86 million ($68 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2019 related to sale of assets, asset write-down and goodwill impairment losses at our equity investee, DCP Midstream; \n \u2022 the absence in 2019 of a recovery of $223 million after-tax in 2018 related to rate cases filed that eliminated a portion of the regulated liability formerly included in our US Gas Transmission business rate base; and \n \u2022 the absence in 2019 of a deferred income tax recovery of $267 million ($196 million attributable to us) in 2018 related to a change in the assertion for the investment in Canadian renewable energy generation assets. \nThe non-cash, unrealized derivative fair value gains and losses discussed above generally arise as a result of a comprehensive long-term economic hedging program to mitigate interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity price risks. This program creates volatility in reported short-term earnings through the recognition of unrealized non-cash gains and losses on financial derivative instruments used to hedge these risks. Over the long-term, we believe our hedging program supports the reliable cash flows and dividend growth upon which our investor value proposition is based.\nAfter taking into consideration the factors above, the remaining $773 million increase in Earnings Attributable to Common Shareholders is primarily explained by the following significant business factors:\n \u2022 increased earnings from our Liquids Pipelines segment due to higher Flanagan South, Seaway Pipeline and Bakken Pipeline System throughput year-over-year; \n \u2022 stronger contributions from our Liquids Pipelines segment due to a higher IJT Benchmark Toll and higher Mainline System ex-Gretna throughput driven by an increase in supply and continuous capacity optimization; \n \u2022 contributions from new Gas Transmission and Midstream assets placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2019; \n \u2022 increased earnings from our Gas Distribution and Storage segment due to colder weather experienced in our franchise areas, higher distribution rates and customer base, and the absence in 2019 of earnings sharing which was recognized in 2018; \n \u2022 increased earnings from our Energy Services segment due to the widening of certain location and quality differentials during the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, which increased opportunities to generate profitable transportation margins that were realized during 2019; \n \u2022 lower earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2019 following the completion of the Sponsored Vehicles buy-in in the fourth quarter of 2018; and \n \u2022 the net favorable effect of translating United States dollar EBITDA at a higher Canadian to United States dollar average exchange rate (Average Exchange Rate) of $1.33 in 2019 compared with $1.30 in 2018, partially offset by realized losses arising from our foreign exchange risk management program. \nThe positive business factors above were partially offset by the following:\n \u2022 the absence in 2019 of earnings from MOLP and the provincially regulated portion of our Canadian natural gas gathering and processing businesses which were sold in the second half of 2018; \n \u2022 higher operating costs on our Gas Transmission and Midstream assets primarily due to higher pipeline integrity costs; \n \u2022 higher depreciation and amortization expense as a result of placing new assets into service, partially offset by depreciation no longer recorded for assets which were classified as held for sale or sold during the second half of 2018; and \n \u2022 higher income tax expense due to higher earnings, the buy-in of our United States sponsored vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2018 and lower foreign tax rate differentials in 2019. \nREVENUES\nWe generate revenues from three primary sources: transportation and other services, gas distribution sales and commodity sales.\nTransportation and other services revenues of $16,555 million, $14,358 million and $13,877 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were earned from our crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation businesses and also include power generation revenues from our portfolio of renewable and power generation assets. For our transportation assets operating under market-based arrangements, revenues are driven by volumes transported and the corresponding tolls for transportation services. For assets operating under take-or-pay contracts, revenues reflect the terms of the underlying contract for services or capacity. For rate-regulated assets, revenues are charged in accordance with tolls established by the regulator, and in most cost-of-service based arrangements are reflective of our cost to provide the service plus a regulator-approved rate of return. Higher transportation and other services revenues reflected increased throughput on our core liquids pipeline assets combined with the incremental revenues associated with assets placed into service over the past three years.\nGas distribution sales revenues of $4,205 million, $4,360 million and $4,215 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were recognized in a manner consistent with the underlying rate-setting mechanism mandated by the regulator. Revenues generated by the gas distribution businesses are primarily driven by volumes delivered, which vary with weather and customer composition and utilization, as well as regulator-approved rates. The cost of natural gas is passed through to customers through rates and does not ultimately impact earnings due to its flow-through nature.\nCommodity sales of $29,309 million, $27,660 million and $26,286 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were generated primarily through our Energy Services operations. Energy Services includes the contemporaneous purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas, power and Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) to generate a margin, which is typically a small fraction of gross revenue. While sales revenue generated from these operations are impacted by commodity prices, net margins and earnings are relatively insensitive to commodity prices and reflect activity levels which are driven by differences in commodity prices between locations, grades and points in time, rather than on absolute prices. Any residual commodity margin risk is closely monitored and managed. Revenues from these operations depend on activity levels, which vary from year-to-year depending on market conditions and commodity prices.\nOur revenues also include changes in unrealized derivative fair value gains and losses related to foreign exchange and commodity price contracts used to manage exposures from movements in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. The mark-to-market accounting creates volatility and impacts the comparability of revenues in the short-term, but we believe over the long-term, the economic hedging program supports reliable cash flows.\nDIVIDENDS\nWe have paid common share dividends in every year since we became a publicly traded company in 1953. In December 2019, we announced a 9.8 percent increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.81 per common share, or $3.24 annualized, effective with the dividend payable on March 1, 2020.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nLIQUIDS PIPELINES\n\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared with year ended December 31, 2018\nEBITDA was positively impacted by $1,926 million due to certain unusual, infrequent or other non-operating factors, primarily explained by the following:\n \u2022 a non-cash, unrealized gain of $976 million in 2019 compared with a loss of $1,077 million in 2018 reflecting net fair value gains and losses arising from changes in the mark-to-market value of derivative financial instruments used to manage foreign exchange and commodity price risks; and \n \u2022 the absence in 2019 of a loss of $154 million in 2018 related to Line 10, which is a component of our Mainline System, resulting from its classification as an asset held for sale and the subsequent measurement at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. \nThe positive factors above were partially offset by the following unusual, infrequent or other non-operating factors:\n \u2022 a loss of $310 million in 2019 resulting from the review of our comprehensive long-term economic hedging program and a payment to certain hedge counterparties to pre-settle and reset the hedge rate on a portion of our hedging program; and \n \u2022 a loss of $21 million in 2019 related to the write-off of project development costs resulting from the withdrawal of our permit application for the Texas COLT Offshore Loading Project. \nAfter taking into consideration the factors above, the remaining $424 million increase is primarily explained by the following significant business factors:\n \u2022 higher Flanagan South and Seaway Pipeline throughput year-over-year driven by the redirection of throughput to the Gulf Coast resulting from refinery outages in the United States Midwest in the first half of 2019 and strong Gulf Coast demand resulting from favorable price differentials; \n \u2022 higher Bakken Pipeline System throughput year-over-year driven by strong production in the region; \n \u2022 higher Mainline System ex-Gretna throughput of 2,705 kbpd in 2019 compared with 2,631 kbpd in 2018 driven by an increase in supply and continuous capacity optimization; \n \u2022 a higher average IJT Benchmark Toll of $4.18 in 2019 compared with $4.11 in 2018; and \n \u2022 the net favorable effect of translating United States dollar EBITDA at a higher Average Exchange Rate of $1.33 in 2019 compared with $1.30 in 2018. \nThe positive business factors above were partially offset by the unfavorable effect of a lower foreign exchange hedge rate used to lock-in United States dollar denominated Canadian Mainline revenues of US$1.19 in 2019 compared with US$1.26 in 2018.\nGAS TRANSMISSION AND MIDSTREAM\n\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared with year ended December 31, 2018\nEBITDA was negatively impacted by the absence of contributions in 2019 of approximately $240 million from the sale of MOLP on August 1, 2018 and the sale of the provincially regulated portion of our Canadian natural gas gathering and processing businesses on October 1, 2018.\nEBITDA was positively impacted by $1,237 million due to certain unusual, infrequent or other non-operating factors primarily explained by the following:\n \u2022 the absence in 2019 of a goodwill impairment charge of $1,019 million in 2018 resulting from the classification of our Canadian natural gas gathering and processing businesses as held for sale; and \n \u2022 the absence in 2019 of a loss of $913 million in 2018 resulting from the further revision to the fair value of our MOLP assets held for sale based on the sale price. \nThe positive factors above were partially offset by the following unusual, infrequent or other non-operating factors:\n \u2022 a loss of $268 million in 2019 resulting from the sale of the federally regulated portion of our Canadian natural gas gathering and processing businesses; \n \u2022 a loss of $105 million in 2019 resulting from the write-off of project costs related to the Access Northeast pipeline project; \n \u2022 a loss of $86 million in 2019 related to the sale of assets, asset write-downs and goodwill impairment losses at our equity investee, DCP Midstream; and \n \u2022 the absence in 2019 of a recovery of $223 million in 2018 related to rate cases filed that eliminated a portion of the regulated liability formerly included in our US Gas Transmission business rate base. \nAfter taking into consideration the factors above, the remaining $40 million increase is primarily explained by the following significant business factors:\n \u2022 contributions from Valley Crossing Pipeline and certain other Offshore and US Gas Transmission assets that were placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2019; and \n \u2022 the net favorable effect of translating United States dollar EBITDA at a higher Average Exchange Rate of $1.33 in 2019 compared with $1.30 in 2018. \nThe positive business factors above were partially offset by the following:\n \u2022 higher operating costs on our US Gas Transmission assets primarily due to higher pipeline integrity costs; \n \u2022 lower revenues and higher operating costs from US Gas Transmission due to the Texas Eastern natural gas pipeline system incident in Lincoln County, Kentucky, refer to Recent Developments - Texas Eastern Rupture; and \n \u2022 decreased fractionation margins at our Aux Sable joint venture driven by lower NGL prices. \nGAS DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE\n\nEGD and Union Gas were amalgamated on January 1, 2019. The amalgamated company has continued as Enbridge Gas. Post amalgamation the financial results of Enbridge Gas reflect the combined performance of EGD and Union Gas.\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared with year ended December 31, 2018\nEBITDA was negatively impacted by $57 million due to certain unusual, infrequent or other non-operating factors, primarily explained by the following:\n \u2022 employee severance costs of $39 million in 2019 related to the amalgamation of EGD and Union Gas; \n \u2022 a loss of $10 million in 2019 resulting from the sale of St. Lawrence Gas; and \n \u2022 a non-cash, unrealized loss of $12 million in 2019 compared with a gain of $6 million in 2018 arising from the change in the mark-to-market value of our equity investee's, Noverco's derivative financial instruments. \nThe negative factors above were partially offset by the absence in 2019 of a negative equity earnings adjustment of $9 million in 2018 at our equity investee, Noverco, arising from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States.\nAfter taking into consideration the factors above, the remaining $93 million increase is primarily explained by the following significant business factors:\n \u2022 increased earnings of $36 million resulting from colder weather experienced in our franchise service areas when compared with the corresponding period in 2018; \n \u2022 increased earnings from higher distribution charges primarily resulting from increases in distribution rates and customer base; \n \u2022 the absence in 2019 of earnings sharing which was recognized in 2018 under EGD's previous incentive rate structure; and \n \u2022 synergy captures realized from the amalgamation of EGD and Union Gas. \nThe positive business factors above were partially offset by the following:\n \u2022 the effects of the accelerated capital cost allowance deductions reflected as a pass through to customers, consistent with the OEB's prescribed deferral account treatment; and \n \u2022 the absence of contributions in 2019 from EGNB and St. Lawrence Gas which were sold on October 1, 2019 and November 1, 2019, respectively. \nRENEWABLE POWER GENERATION\n\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared with year ended December 31, 2018\nEBITDA was negatively impacted by $247 million due to certain unusual, infrequent or other non-operating factors, primarily explained by the following:\n \u2022 a loss of $297 million in 2019 resulting from the classification of our MATL assets as held for sale and the subsequent measurement at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell; and \n \u2022 a loss of $10 million in 2019 related to the write-down of offshore transmission assets anticipated to be disposed of in 2020 at our equity investee, Rampion Offshore Wind Limited. \nThe negative factors above were partially offset by the following", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nINTRODUCTION\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on and should be read in conjunction with \"Forward-Looking Information\", Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses 2019 and 2018 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. For discussion of 2017 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017, refer to Part II. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nCANADIAN LINE 3 REPLACEMENT PROGRAM PLACED INTO SERVICE\nThe Canadian Line 3 Replacement Program was placed into service on December 1, 2019, with an interim surcharge on Mainline System volumes of US$0.20 per barrel. This safety-driven maintenance project reflects the importance of protecting the environment and ensuring the continued safe and reliable operations of our Mainline System well into the future. For further details refer to Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects - Liquids Pipelines.\nSTATE OF MINNESOTA PERMITTING TIMELINE FOR U.S. LINE 3 REPLACEMENT PROGRAM\nOn June 3, 2019, the Minnesota Court of Appeals rendered a decision on the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission's (MNPUC's) adequacy determination of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the U.S. L3R Program. While denying eight of the nine appealed items, the Minnesota Court of Appeals identified one issue that led it to reverse the adequacy determination. On July 3, 2019, certain project opponents sought further appellate review from the Minnesota Supreme Court. On September 17, 2019, based on the respective responses of the MNPUC and the Company, the Minnesota Supreme Court denied the opponents' petitions thus restoring the MNPUC with jurisdiction. At a hearing on October 1, 2019, the MNPUC directed the Department of Commerce to submit a revised FEIS by December 9, 2019. The Department of Commerce issued the revised FEIS on December 9, 2019, and the MNPUC gathered public comment on that document through January 16, 2020. On February 3, 2020, the MNPUC approved the adequacy of the revised FEIS and reinstated the Certificate of Need and Route Permit, clearing the way for construction of the pipeline to commence following the issuance of required permits.\nAt this time, we cannot determine when all necessary permits to commence construction will be issued. For further details refer to Growth Projects - Regulatory Matters - United States Line 3 Replacement Program.\nMAINLINE SYSTEM CONTRACTING\nOn August 2, 2019, we launched an open season for transportation services on our Mainline System. The open season provided shippers with the opportunity to enter into long-term contracts for priority access on the Mainline System upon maturity of the current CTS agreement on June 30, 2021.\nOn September 27, 2019, after receiving complaints, the CER ordered that we may not offer firm service to prospective shippers on our Mainline System until such firm service, including all associated tolls and terms and conditions of service, has been approved by the CER. While this decision was a significant departure from past regulatory precedents, the CER noted that its decision to hold a regulatory review prior to the open season does not prejudice our ability to offer long term priority access contracts on the Mainline System.\nOn December 19, 2019, we submitted an application to the CER to implement contracting on our Mainline System. The application for contracted and uncommitted service included the associated terms, conditions and tolls of each service, which would be offered in an open season following approval by the CER. The tolls and services would replace the current CTS that is in place until June 30, 2021. If a replacement agreement is not in place by that time, the CTS tolls will continue on an interim basis.\nThe application that we filed is the result of over two years of extensive negotiations with a diverse group of shippers and has been designed to align the interests of us and our shippers. Shippers, which represent over 70 percent of our current Mainline System throughput, have filed letters supporting the application with the CER, demonstrating the strong shipper backing for the offering.\nOn February 7, 2020, we replied to the letters solicited by the CER regarding comments from interested parties both in opposition and support of our application. We expect a thorough regulatory process to continue through substantially all of 2020.\nASSET MONETIZATION\nEnbridge Gas New Brunswick Business\nOn October 1, 2019, we closed the sale of EGNB to Liberty Utilities (Canada) LP, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp., for proceeds of approximately $331 million.\nSt. Lawrence Gas Company Inc.\nOn November 1, 2019, we closed the sale of the issued and outstanding shares of St. Lawrence Gas for proceeds of approximately $72 million.\nCanadian Natural Gas Gathering and Processing Businesses\nOn December 31, 2019, we closed the sale of the federally regulated Canadian natural gas gathering and processing businesses to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. and its institutional partners (collectively, Brookfield) for proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion, after closing adjustments. These federally regulated businesses represent the second and final phase of the $4.3 billion transaction that was previously announced on July 4, 2018.\nMontana-Alberta Tie Line\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we committed to a plan to sell the MATL transmission assets. The purchase and sale agreement was signed in January 2020. Subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020.\nRefer to Liquidity and Capital Resources - Sources and Uses of Cash for details on the use of proceeds from our asset monetization activity discussed above.\nENBRIDGE GAS INC. 2019 RATE APPLICATION\nIn September 2019, Enbridge Gas received a Decision and Order from the OEB on its application for 2019 rates. The 2019 rate application was filed in December 2018 in accordance with the parameters of Enbridge Gas's OEB approved Price Cap Incentive Regulation rate setting mechanism and represents the first year of a five-year term. The Decision and Order approved an effective date for base rates of April 1, 2019, and the inclusion of incremental capital module amounts to allow for the recovery of incremental capital investments.\nENBRIDGE GAS INC. 2020 RATE APPLICATION\nIn October 2019, Enbridge Gas filed an application with the OEB for the setting of rates for 2020 and for the funding of discrete incremental capital investments through the incremental capital module mechanism. The 2020 rate application was filed in accordance with the parameters of Enbridge Gas' OEB approved Price Cap Incentive Regulation rate setting mechanism and represents the second year of a five-year term. In December 2019, Enbridge Gas received a Decision and Order from the OEB which approved 2020 rates on an interim basis effective January 1, 2020. A decision on Enbridge Gas' application for incremental capital module amounts is expected in the second quarter of 2020.\nTEXAS EASTERN PIPELINE RUPTURE\nOn August 1, 2019, a rupture occurred on Line 15, a 30-inch natural gas pipeline that is a component of the Texas Eastern natural gas pipeline system in Lincoln County, Kentucky. While the two adjacent pipelines have been returned to service, Line 15 remains shut down in the affected area and the timeline for its return to service has not yet been determined. There was one fatality. We are continuing to support the National Transportation Safety Board in its investigation, the community and the community members who were impacted by the rupture. The Texas Eastern natural gas pipeline system extends approximately 1,700 miles from producing fields in the Gulf Coast region of Texas and Louisiana to Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York.\nDue to the incident, before expected recoveries, we experienced lower revenues and higher operating costs of $34 million in 2019. Texas Eastern Transmission, LP (Texas Eastern) is included in a comprehensive insurance program that is maintained for our subsidiaries and affiliates, which includes liability, property and business interruption insurance.\nTEXAS EASTERN RATE CASE\nOn June 1, 2019, Texas Eastern put into effect its updated rates. These increased recourse rates are subject to refund and interest. Following extensive negotiations on the Texas Eastern rate case, we reached an agreement with shippers and filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the FERC on October 28, 2019. On January 13, 2020, the Administrative Law Judge certified this uncontested Stipulation and Agreement to the FERC and we expect a decision from the FERC in the second quarter of 2020. Upon receipt of a decision from the FERC we will begin recognizing updated rates within our results of operations.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(millions of Canadian dollars, except per share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment earnings/(loss) before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquids Pipelines\n</td> <td>7,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gas Transmission and Midstream\n</td> <td>3,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,269\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gas Distribution and Storage\n</td> <td>1,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Renewable Power Generation\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy Services\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(263\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations and Other\n</td> <td>429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(708\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(337\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>(3,391\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3,246\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3,163\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(2,663\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2,703\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2,556\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>(1,708\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(237\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>2,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>(122\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(451\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(407\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preference share dividends\n</td> <td>(383\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(367\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(330\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings attributable to common shareholders\n</td> <td>5,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per common share\n</td> <td>2.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per common share\n</td> <td>2.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.65\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared with year ended December 31, 2018\nEarnings Attributable to Common Shareholders were net positively impacted by $2,034 million due to certain unusual, infrequent or other non-operating factors, primarily explained by the following:\n \u2022 a non-cash, unrealized derivative fair value gain of $1,806 million ($1,276 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2019, compared with a loss of $660 million ($397 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2018, reflecting net fair value gains and losses arising from changes in the mark-to-market value of derivative financial instruments used to manage foreign exchange and commodity prices risks; \n \u2022 a non-cash, write-down of crude oil and natural gas inventories to the lower of cost or market in our Energy Services business segment of $188 million ($144 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2019, compared with $327 million ($239 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2018; \n \u2022 the absence in 2019 of a goodwill impairment charge of $1,019 million after-tax attributable to us in 2018 resulting from the classification of our Canadian natural gas gathering and processing businesses as held for sale; \n \u2022 the absence in 2019 of a loss of $913 million ($701 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2018 on Midcoast Operating, L.P. and its subsidiaries (MOLP) resulting from a revision to the fair value of the assets held for sale based on the sale price; \n \u2022 the absence in 2019 of a loss of $154 million ($95 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2018 related to the Line 10 crude oil pipeline, which is a component of our Mainline System, resulting from its classification as an asset held for sale and the subsequent measurement at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell; and \n \u2022 employee severance, transition and transformation costs of $140 million ($127 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2019, compared with $203 million ($181 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2018. \nThe positive factors above were partially offset by the following unusual, infrequent or other non-operating factors:\n \u2022 a loss of $467 million after-tax attributable to us in 2019 ($268 million loss on sale and $199 million tax expense) resulting from the sale of the federally regulated portion of our Canadian natural gas gathering and processing businesses; \n \u2022 a loss of $310 million ($229 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2019 resulting from the review of our comprehensive long-term economic hedging program and a payment to certain hedge counterparties to pre-settle and reset the hedge rate on a portion of our hedging program; \n \u2022 a loss of $297 million ($218 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2019 resulting from the classification of our MATL assets as held for sale and the subsequent measurement at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell; \n \u2022 a loss of $105 million ($79 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2019 resulting from the write-off of project costs related to the Access Northeast pipeline project; \n \u2022 a loss of $86 million ($68 million after-tax attributable to us) in 2019 related to sale of assets, asset write-down and goodwill impairment losses at our equity investee, DCP Midstream; \n \u2022 the absence in 2019 of a recovery of $223 million after-tax in 2018 related to rate cases filed that eliminated a portion of the regulated liability formerly included in our US Gas Transmission business rate base; and \n \u2022 the absence in 2019 of a deferred income tax recovery of $267 million ($196 million attributable to us) in 2018 related to a change in the assertion for the investment in Canadian renewable energy generation assets. \nThe non-cash, unrealized derivative fair value gains and losses discussed above generally arise as a result of a comprehensive long-term economic hedging program to mitigate interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity price risks. This program creates volatility in reported short-term earnings through the recognition of unrealized non-cash gains and losses on financial derivative instruments used to hedge these risks. Over the long-term, we believe our hedging program supports the reliable cash flows and dividend growth upon which our investor value proposition is based.\nAfter taking into consideration the factors above, the remaining $773 million increase in Earnings Attributable to Common Shareholders is primarily explained by the following significant business factors:\n \u2022 increased earnings from our Liquids Pipelines segment due to higher Flanagan South, Seaway Pipeline and Bakken Pipeline System throughput year-over-year; \n \u2022 stronger contributions from our Liquids Pipelines segment due to a higher IJT Benchmark Toll and higher Mainline System ex-Gretna throughput driven by an increase in supply and continuous capacity optimization; \n \u2022 contributions from new Gas Transmission and Midstream assets placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2019; \n \u2022 increased earnings from our Gas Distribution and Storage segment due to colder weather experienced in our franchise areas, higher distribution rates and customer base, and the absence in 2019 of earnings sharing which was recognized in 2018; \n \u2022 increased earnings from our Energy Services segment due to the widening of certain location and quality differentials during the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, which increased opportunities to generate profitable transportation margins that were realized during 2019; \n \u2022 lower earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2019 following the completion of the Sponsored Vehicles buy-in in the fourth quarter of 2018; and \n \u2022 the net favorable effect of translating United States dollar EBITDA at a higher Canadian to United States dollar average exchange rate (Average Exchange Rate) of $1.33 in 2019 compared with $1.30 in 2018, partially offset by realized losses arising from our foreign exchange risk management program. \nThe positive business factors above were partially offset by the following:\n \u2022 the absence in 2019 of earnings from MOLP and the provincially regulated portion of our Canadian natural gas gathering and processing businesses which were sold in the second half of 2018; \n \u2022 higher operating costs on our Gas Transmission and Midstream assets primarily due to higher pipeline integrity costs; \n \u2022 higher depreciation and amortization expense as a result of placing new assets into service, partially offset by depreciation no longer recorded for assets which were classified as held for sale or sold during the second half of 2018; and \n \u2022 higher income tax expense due to higher earnings, the buy-in of our United States sponsored vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2018 and lower foreign tax rate differentials in 2019. \nREVENUES\nWe generate revenues from three primary sources: transportation and other services, gas distribution sales and commodity sales.\nTransportation and other services revenues of $16,555 million, $14,358 million and $13,877 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were earned from our crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation businesses and also include power generation revenues from our portfolio of renewable and power generation assets. For our transportation assets operating under market-based arrangements, revenues are driven by volumes transported and the corresponding tolls for transportation services. For assets operating under take-or-pay contracts, revenues reflect the terms of the underlying contract for services or capacity. For rate-regulated assets, revenues are charged in accordance with tolls established by the regulator, and in most cost-of-service based arrangements are reflective of our cost to provide the service plus a regulator-approved rate of return. Higher transportation and other services revenues reflected increased throughput on our core liquids pipeline assets combined with the incremental revenues associated with assets placed into service over the past three years.\nGas distribution sales revenues of $4,205 million, $4,360 million and $4,215 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were recognized in a manner consistent with the underlying rate-setting mechanism mandated by the regulator. Revenues generated by the gas distribution businesses are primarily driven by volumes delivered, which vary with weather and customer composition and utilization, as well as regulator-approved rates. The cost of natural gas is passed through to customers through rates and does not ultimately impact earnings due to its flow-through nature.\nCommodity sales of $29,309 million, $27,660 million and $26,286 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were generated primarily through our Energy Services operations. Energy Services includes the contemporaneous purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas, power and Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) to generate a margin, which is typically a small fraction of gross revenue. While sales revenue generated from these operations are impacted by commodity prices, net margins and earnings are relatively insensitive to commodity prices and reflect activity levels which are driven by differences in commodity prices between locations, grades and points in time, rather than on absolute prices. Any residual commodity margin risk is closely monitored and managed. Revenues from these operations depend on activity levels, which vary from year-to-year depending on market conditions and commodity prices.\nOur revenues also include changes in unrealized derivative fair value gains and losses related to foreign exchange and commodity price contracts used to manage exposures from movements in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. The mark-to-market accounting creates volatility and impacts the comparability of revenues in the short-term, but we believe over the long-term, the economic hedging program supports reliable cash flows.\nDIVIDENDS\nWe have paid common share dividends in every year since we became a publicly traded company in 1953. In December 2019, we announced a 9.8 percent increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.81 per common share, or $3.24 annualized, effective with the dividend payable on March 1, 2020.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nLIQUIDS PIPELINES\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(millions of Canadian dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>7,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared with year ended December 31, 2018\nEBITDA was positively impacted by $1,926 million due to certain unusual, infrequent or other non-operating factors, primarily explained by the following:\n \u2022 a non-cash, unrealized gain of $976 million in 2019 compared with a loss of $1,077 million in 2018 reflecting net fair value gains and losses arising from changes in the mark-to-market value of derivative financial instruments used to manage foreign exchange and commodity price risks; and \n \u2022 the absence in 2019 of a loss of $154 million in 2018 related to Line 10, which is a component of our Mainline System, resulting from its classification as an asset held for sale and the subsequent measurement at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. \nThe positive factors above were partially offset by the following unusual, infrequent or other non-operating factors:\n \u2022 a loss of $310 million in 2019 resulting from the review of our comprehensive long-term economic hedging program and a payment to certain hedge counterparties to pre-settle and reset the hedge rate on a portion of our hedging program; and \n \u2022 a loss of $21 million in 2019 related to the write-off of project development costs resulting from the withdrawal of our permit application for the Texas COLT Offshore Loading Project. \nAfter taking into consideration the factors above, the remaining $424 million increase is primarily explained by the following significant business factors:\n \u2022 higher Flanagan South and Seaway Pipeline throughput year-over-year driven by the redirection of throughput to the Gulf Coast resulting from refinery outages in the United States Midwest in the first half of 2019 and strong Gulf Coast demand resulting from favorable price differentials; \n \u2022 higher Bakken Pipeline System throughput year-over-year driven by strong production in the region; \n \u2022 higher Mainline System ex-Gretna throughput of 2,705 kbpd in 2019 compared with 2,631 kbpd in 2018 driven by an increase in supply and continuous capacity optimization; \n \u2022 a higher average IJT Benchmark Toll of $4.18 in 2019 compared with $4.11 in 2018; and \n \u2022 the net favorable effect of translating United States dollar EBITDA at a higher Average Exchange Rate of $1.33 in 2019 compared with $1.30 in 2018. \nThe positive business factors above were partially offset by the unfavorable effect of a lower foreign exchange hedge rate used to lock-in United States dollar denominated Canadian Mainline revenues of US$1.19 in 2019 compared with US$1.26 in 2018.\nGAS TRANSMISSION AND MIDSTREAM\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(millions of Canadian dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings/(loss) before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>3,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,269\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared with year ended December 31, 2018\nEBITDA was negatively impacted by the absence of contributions in 2019 of approximately $240 million from the sale of MOLP on August 1, 2018 and the sale of the provincially regulated portion of our Canadian natural gas gathering and processing businesses on October 1, 2018.\nEBITDA was positively impacted by $1,237 million due to certain unusual, infrequent or other non-operating factors primarily explained by the following:\n \u2022 the absence in 2019 of a goodwill impairment charge of $1,019 million in 2018 resulting from the classification of our Canadian natural gas gathering and processing businesses as held for sale;

and \n \u2022 the net favorable effect of translating United States dollar EBITDA at a higher Average Exchange Rate of $1.33 in 2019 compared with $1.30 in 2018. \nThe positive business factors above were partially offset by the following:\n \u2022 higher operating costs on our US Gas Transmission assets primarily due to higher pipeline integrity costs; \n \u2022 lower revenues and higher operating costs from US Gas Transmission due to the Texas Eastern natural gas pipeline system incident in Lincoln County, Kentucky, refer to Recent Developments - Texas Eastern Rupture;
