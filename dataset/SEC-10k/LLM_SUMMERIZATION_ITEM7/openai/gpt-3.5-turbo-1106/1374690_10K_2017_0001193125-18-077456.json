MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our \u201cSelected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results described, in or implied by, these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed above in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements made by us, which speak only as of the date they are made. We disclaim any obligation, except as specifically required by law and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to significantly improving the health and well-being of patients affected by type 2 diabetes, Prader-Willi syndrome, or PWS, and potentially other metabolically related disorders. We are focused on developing novel therapeutics that treat the underlying biological mechanisms through the methionine aminopeptidase 2, or MetAP2, pathway. We have pioneered the study of MetAP2 inhibitors in both common and rare forms of obesity. Our lead product candidate is ZGN-1061, a novel fumagillin-class MetAP2 inhibitor administered by subcutaneous injection, which is currently being profiled for its utility in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other related metabolic disorders. We have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of ZGN-1061 in the Netherlands, which was comprised of a single ascending dose, or SAD, portion and a multiple ascending dose, or MAD, portion. This clinical trial evaluated ZGN-1061 for safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics while also gaining an early indication of efficacy over four weeks of treatment. We reported positive top line results from this clinical trial in May 2017 and presented the full data package at the American Diabetes Association's 77th Annual Scientific Sessions in June 2017. In this Phase 1 assessment ZGN-1061 demonstrated rapid drug absorption and clearance in line with criteria established in advance for the molecule, and had a favorable tolerability profile with no safety signals identified, including no evidence of pro-thrombotic effects. The data show that ZGN-1061 treatment causes improvements across multiple metabolic measures consistent with MetAP2 inhibition, and patients in the clinical trial experienced mean weight loss of up to approximately one pound per week. In the third quarter of 2017, we advanced ZGN-1061 into a Phase 2 clinical trial in both Australia and New Zealand, in patients with type 2 diabetes who are obese and are failing to respond adequately to current therapies. In March 2018, we reported results of an interim analysis of this clinical trial. We expect to report full results of the core part of this clinical trial mid-year 2018, and the results of the entire trial, including the additional arm recently added to the trial, early in 2019. In January 2018, we announced advancement of our highly optimized MetAP2 development candidate ZGN-1258, and in the first quarter of 2018, initiated investigational new drug, or IND, application enabling nonclinical efforts for evaluation in the treatment of people affected by PWS. We anticipate filing an IND application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and beginning Phase 1 clinical development by the end of 2018.\nZGN-1061 was discovered by our researchers as part of a multi-year campaign to identify novel compounds that avoided limiting nonclinical safety concerns observed with our first-generation compound. The compound has similar potency, and range of desired pharmacological activities in animal models as other MetAP2 inhibitors, including beloranib. ZGN-1061 displays broadly improved safety margins in nonclinical studies, supporting the value of the compound as a more highly optimized drug product candidate.\nZGN-1061 acts through potent inhibition of MetAP2, an enzyme that modulates the activity of key cellular processes that control metabolism. MetAP2 inhibitors work, at least in part, by directing MetAP2 binding to\ncellular stress and growth factor mediators, thereby reducing the tone of signals that drive lipid synthesis by the liver and fat storage throughout the body. In this manner, MetAP2 inhibition serves the purpose of re-establishing balance to the ways the body stores and metabolizes fat and glucose. MetAP2 inhibitors reduce the production of new fatty acid molecules by the liver and help convert stored fats into useful energy, while stimulating use of glucose and fats as an energy source. In the setting of type 2 diabetes, these processes lead to improvement of glycemic control.\nZGN-1258 was also discovered by our researchers as part of a multi-year campaign to identify novel compounds that avoided limiting nonclinical safety concerns observed with our first-generation compound. The compound has similar potency, and range of desired pharmacological activities in animal models as other MetAP2 inhibitors, including beloranib. ZGN-1258 displays broadly improved safety margins in nonclinical studies, supporting the value of the compound as a more highly optimized drug product candidate.\nZGN-1258 acts through potent inhibition of MetAP2. Like other MetAP2 inhibitors, ZGN-1258 modulates the activity of key cellular processes that control metabolism and impact lipid synthesis and storage throughout the body and leads to increase use of stored fats as an energy source. ZGN-1258 displays enhanced uptake into the brain and displays greater potency and activity in animal models of hyperphagic behaviors relative to other compounds including ZGN-1061. These differences support the use of ZGN-1258 in higher need indications such as PWS, in which brain activity is likely to be more important for therapeutic effect. Treatment of obese and hyperphagic animals with ZGN-1258 leads to reduction in both pathologic food intake and rapid body weight loss, making it of interest in the treatment of severe forms of human obesity.\nSince our inception in November 2005, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing ZGN-1061, beloranib, ZGN-839, ZGN-1258 and additional MetAP2 inhibitors, building our intellectual property portfolio, developing our supply chain, business planning, raising capital, and providing general and administrative support for such operations. From our inception through our initial public offering, or IPO, in June 2014, we received gross proceeds of $104.0 million from sales of redeemable convertible preferred stock and, to a lesser extent, through the issuances of convertible promissory notes. During June 2014, we completed our IPO with net proceeds of $102.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions paid by us. On January 28, 2015, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock, with net proceeds of $130.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions paid by us.\nWe have never generated any revenue and have incurred net losses in each year since our inception. We have an accumulated deficit of $289.6 million as of December 31, 2017. Our net loss was $52.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $57.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. These losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with in-licensing of beloranib, research and development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe expect to continue to incur expenses in connection with our ongoing activities, if and as we:\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>advance the development of ZGN-1061 through Phase 2 clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>advance the development of ZGN-1258 through nonclinical and clinical development; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>seek to identify and advance development of additional product candidates into clinical development and indications for our product candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>seek to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>add operational, financial and management information systems; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>add personnel, including personnel to support our product development and future commercialization; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>maintain, leverage and expand our intellectual property portfolio. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations. Until such time that we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public, private equity, debt financings, or other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. Arrangements with collaborators or others may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates. In addition, we may never successfully complete development of any of our product candidates, obtain adequate patent protection for our technology, obtain necessary regulatory approval for our product candidates or achieve commercial viability for any approved product candidates. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.\nWe expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2017, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least one year from the issuance date of this Annual Report. See \u201c-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nWe have not generated any revenue from product sales since our inception, and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future. If our development efforts result in clinical success and regulatory approval or collaboration agreements with third parties for our product candidates, we may generate revenue from those product candidates or collaborations.\nOperating Expenses\nThe majority of our operating expenses since inception have consisted primarily of research and development activities, and general and administrative costs.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses, which consist primarily of costs associated with our product research and development efforts, are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of:\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>personnel costs, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation for employees engaged in scientific research and development functions; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>third-party contract costs relating to research, formulation, manufacturing, nonclinical studies and clinical trial activities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>external costs of outside consultants; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>payments made under our third-party licensing agreements; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>sponsored research agreements; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>laboratory consumables; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>allocated facility-related costs. </td> </tr>\n</table> We are currently primarily focused on developing ZGN-1061, ZGN-1258 and other early research activities and typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our research and development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, external consultant costs, payments made under our licensing agreements or other internal costs to specific development programs or product candidates unless the payments are specifically identifiable to a development program or product candidate. We record our research and development expenses net of any research and development tax incentives we are entitled to receive from government authorities.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we pursue later stages of clinical development of our product candidates.\nWe cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical trials of our product candidates or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. The duration, costs, and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the scope, rate of progress, and expense of clinical trials and other research and development activities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>clinical trial results; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rate or design; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>significant and changing government regulation; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the FDA's or other regulatory authority's influence on clinical trial design. </td> </tr>\n</table> A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA, or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, consisting of salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation, of our executive, finance, business and corporate development and other administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include travel expenses, allocated facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, insurance expenses, and professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services, including legal expenses to pursue patent protection of our intellectual property. We expect that general and administrative expenses will remain relatively consistent during 2018 as compared to 2017.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest income. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our interest income has not been significant due to low interest earned on invested balances. We anticipate that our interest income will decrease as we continue to incur operating losses.\nInterest expense. Interest expense during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, relates to outstanding borrowings under the 2014 Credit Facility, consisting of the stated interest of 8.1% per year due on outstanding borrowings, a final payment of 6% of amounts drawn down that was recorded as interest expense over the term through the maturity date using the effective-interest method, the amortization of deferred financing costs, the accretion of debt discounts relating to the 2014 Credit Facility. Interest expense in 2018 will relate to the Term Loan of $20.0 million, which closed on December 29, 2017. It bears a variable interest at an annual rate of 1.25% above the prime rate, as well as a final payment equal to 8.0% of the Term Loan is being recorded as interest expense over the term through the maturity date using the effective-interest method.\nForeign currency gains (losses), net. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses), net consists of the realized and unrealized gains and losses from foreign currency-denominated cash balances, vendor payables and tax-related receivables from the Australian government. We currently do not engage in hedging activities related to our foreign currency-denominated receivables and payables; as such, we cannot predict the impact of future foreign currency transaction gains and losses on our operating results. See \u201c-Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\u201d\nIncome Taxes\nSince our inception in 2005, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or our earned tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. As of December 31, 2017, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $54.0 million and $39.6 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2030, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we also had available tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $14.8 million and $2.4 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2021, respectively.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, was signed into United States law. The TCJA includes a number of changes to existing tax law, including, among other things, a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 34% down to a flat rate of 21%, effective as of January 1, 2018, as well as limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of annual taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, in each case, for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 (though any such net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely). The tax rate change resulted in a reduction in the gross amount of our deferred tax assets recorded as of December 31, 2017 with an offsetting reduction in the related valuation allowance, resulting in no income tax expense or benefit being recognized as of the enactment date of the TCJA. In accordance with guidance in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, the final determination of the remeasurement of our deferred assets and liabilities will be completed as additional information becomes available, but no later than one year from the date of enactment of the 2017 Tax Act.\nJOBS Act\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d As an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we are electing not to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision not to take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we are relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. As such, we have elected not to (i) provide an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions apply for a period of five years following the completion of our IPO in June 2014 or until we no longer meet the requirements of being an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d whichever is earlier.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We believe that the estimates and assumptions involved in the accounting policies described below may have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements and, therefore, consider these to be our critical accounting policies. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. See also Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information about these critical accounting policies as well as a description of our other significant accounting policies.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel and outside vendors to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>contract research organizations, or CROs, in connection with clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>investigative sites or other providers in connection with clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>vendors in connection with nonclinical development activities; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>vendors related to product candidate manufacturing, development and distribution of clinical supplies. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense, nonclinical expense, or manufacturing activities. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have historically issued equity awards to employees, directors and consultants, generally in the form of options to purchase shares of our common stock and, to a lesser extent, shares of restricted common stock. We measure stock-based awards granted to employees and directors at fair value on the date of grant and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the\nvesting period of the respective award. Generally, we issue stock options and restricted stock awards with only service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. We measure stock-based awards granted to consultants and nonemployees at the fair value of the award on the date at which the related service is complete. Compensation expense is recognized over the period during which services are rendered by such consultants and nonemployees until completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, the fair value of these awards is re-measured using the then-current fair value of our common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nWe estimate the fair value of each service-based stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Until completion of our IPO in June 2014, we were a private company and lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, we estimated our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our publicly traded peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded stock price. The expected term of our options has been determined utilizing the \u201csimplified\u201d method for awards that qualify as \u201cplain-vanilla\u201d options, while the expected term of our options granted to consultants and nonemployees has been determined based on the contractual term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nIn October 2017, we granted market-based stock option awards which are valued using Monte Carlo simulation models. The number of options expected to vest, based on achievement of the specified market condition, is factored into the grant date Monte Carlo valuations. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the attribution period.\nThe assumptions we used to determine the fair value of service-based stock options granted to employees and directors are as follows, presented on a weighted average basis:\nTable 213: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.75 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> The assumptions that we used to determine the fair value of the market-based stock options granted to employees are as follows, presented on a weighted average basis:\nTable 214: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.24 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> These assumptions represented our best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different. We recognize compensation expense for only the portion of awards that are expected to vest.\nThe following table summarizes the classification of our stock-based compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss:\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $10.4 million related to our ZGN-1061 program, as well as an increase in discovery and screening expenses of $5.9 million, partially offset by decreased costs of $12.9 million in our beloranib program and a decrease of $1.6 million associated with our unallocated expenses.\nCosts associated with our ZGN-1061 program increased period over period by $10.4 million. In the third quarter of 2016 we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for ZGN-1061 which completed recruiting and dosing patients in the first quarter of 2017. The overall increase is primarily due to additional nonclinical studies as well as drug product and drug substance activities as we commenced our Phase 2 clinical trial in the third quarter of 2017 in both Australia and New Zealand, for which we enrolled 137 patients in a 12 week clinical trial. The expenses during the 2016 period were for startup costs for a Phase 1 clinical trial of ZGN-1061 in the Netherlands, which was comprised of 39 patients in a single ascending dose, or SAD, portion and 29 patients in a multiple ascending dose, or MAD, portion.\nOf the decrease in costs associated with our beloranib program, clinical trials costs decreased by $8.3 million period over period and nonclinical and manufacturing costs decreased $4.6 million period over period, both as a result of the suspension of our beloranib program in July 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported topline clinical data from our Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with severe obesity complicated by type 2 diabetes and our U.S. Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with PWS. Prior to the FDA placing the IND application for beloranib on full clinical hold in December 2015, we suspended dosing of patients in the randomized portion of both of these trials in October 2015. In July 2016, we announced the suspension of our beloranib program.\nUnallocated expenses decreased period over period primarily due to a decrease of $1.0 million in consultants, as well as a decrease in personnel related costs of $0.8 million. Consultant costs decreased primarily related to our beloranib program which we suspended in July 2016. Personnel related expenses decreased primarily from a reduction in the number of employees for the 2017 period as compared to the 2016 period, as we had a reduction in workforce which took place in July 2016.\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel related\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,401 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,081 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash stock-based compensation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,163 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,227 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,581 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(240 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,129 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> General and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $6.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was due to decreases in non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $2.2 million, personnel related costs of $2.1 million and professional fees of $1.6 million. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense decreased due mainly to forfeited stock options related to the reduction in workforce in July 2016, as well as a lower stock option grant price for the 2017 annual grant. Personnel related expenses decreased primarily from a reduction in the number of employees for the 2017 period as compared to the 2016 period, from the reduction in workforce which took place in July 2016. Professional fees decreased primarily due to lower legal fees as the plaintiffs for the class action lawsuit had filed a notice of appeal to the First Circuit Court of Appeals and on April 7, 2017, the dismissal with prejudice was affirmed. The decrease was also due to lower commercial readiness costs and investor relations and public relations costs in the 2017 period as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily as a result of suspending development of beloranib in July 2016.\nOther income (expense), net\nInterest expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 of $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, was related to interest expense on our outstanding borrowings under the 2014 Credit Facility, which was fully repaid in December 2017. Interest expense consists primarily of the stated interest of 8.1% per year due on outstanding borrowings. It also includes expense related to the final payment of 6% of amounts drawn down that was recorded over the term through the maturity date using the effective-interest method and the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts relating to the 2014 Credit Facility.\nInterest income. Interest income of $1.0 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, was related to interest earned on our marketable securities balances.\nForeign currency transaction gains (losses), net. We had foreign currency transaction gains of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and no impact in 2016. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses consisted of the realized and unrealized gains and losses from foreign currency-denominated cash balances, vendor payables and tax-related receivables from the Australian government, generally reflecting the fluctuation of the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nThe following table

</td> </tr>\n</table> Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $14.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $15.9 million decrease in our beloranib program, and a decrease of $4.0 million associated with our ZGN-839 program, partially offset by increased costs of $3.1 million associated with our unallocated expenses and increased costs of $1.8 million in second-generation MetAP2 inhibitors, primarily related to ZGN-1061.\nOf the decrease in our beloranib program, clinical trial expenses for beloranib decreased by $9.5 million period over period as a result of the status of our clinical trials in 2016 and 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported top-line clinical data from our Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with severe obesity complicated by type 2 diabetes and our U.S. Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with PWS. Prior to the FDA placing the IND application for beloranib on full clinical hold in December 2015, we suspended dosing of patients in the randomized portion of both of these clinical trials in October 2015. In July 2016, we announced the suspension of our beloranib program. During the year ended December 31, 2015, both of the clinical trials noted above were ongoing, enrolling and dosing patients. Clinical trial activities undertaken by our Australian subsidiary are recorded net of a 45% research and development tax incentive from the Australian government. This tax incentive reduced our expenses by $0.3 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in nonclinical and manufacturing of $6.4 million period over period is due to stage of development as well as the fact that the beloranib IND application was on full clinical hold during 2016, and in July 2016, we announced the suspension of our beloranib program. The decrease in ZGN-839 costs of $4.0 million period over period is due to the withdrawal of our IND application in January 2016 in order to generate data from additional nonclinical studies requested by the FDA. In October 2016, we suspended further development of ZGN-839. We are focusing all of our personnel and financial resources on ZGN-1061 and the discovery of novel and highly-differentiated MetAP2 inhibitors.\nCosts associated with our second-generation MetAP2 inhibitors, primarily related to ZGN-1061 increased period over period by $1.8 million. The work in 2016 was specific to ZGN-1061, including work in chemistry, toxicology, pharmacology and contract manufacturing costs. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2016 we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for ZGN-1061. During the 2015 period, we were conducting research and screening activities on a number of second-generation MetAP2 inhibitors.\nUnallocated expenses increased period over period primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs of $2.6 million, $0.6 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and $0.4 million in other costs, partially offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in consultants. Personnel related expense increases resulted primarily from severance expense of $0.5 million as well as an increase in the number of employees for the first and second quarters of the 2016 period over the 2015 period. Subsequently, we had a reduction in workforce which took place in July 2016. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense was impacted by an increase in the annual stock option grant to employees during late March 2016. Other unallocated expenses were driven by increases in travel expenses and facilities expenses. Consultant costs decreased primarily related to our beloranib program which we suspended in July 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel related\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,401 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>116 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash stock-based compensation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,652 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>738 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,037 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,548 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(212 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(906 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $0.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in professional fees of $1.5 million primarily due to the fact that we were no longer working on branding and commercial-readiness related to PWS as we were on clinical hold throughout 2016, and then in July 2016 we suspended the development of our beloranib program. This decrease was partially offset by increased non-cash stock-based\ncompensation expense of $0.7 million and increased personnel related costs of $0.1 million. The increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense was due to the annual stock option grant to employees during late March 2016 as well as the annual board of director's grant in late June 2016. Personnel related costs increased period over period primarily due to severance expense of $0.9 million, partially offset by a reversal of part of the 2015 bonus expense during 2016, as executive officers were not paid a bonus during 2016, as well as an overall decrease in headcount.\nOther income (expense), net\nInterest expense. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 of $0.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively, was related to interest expense on our outstanding borrowings under the 2014 Credit Facility. Interest expense consists primarily of the stated interest of 8.1% per year due on outstanding borrowings. It also includes expense related to the final payment of 6% of amounts drawn down that is being recorded over the term through the maturity date using the effective-interest method and the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts relating to the 2014 Credit Facility.\nInterest income. Interest income of $0.9 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, was related to interest earned on our marketable securities balances.\nForeign currency transaction gains (losses), net. We had foreign currency transaction losses of less than $0.1 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses consisted of the realized and unrealized gains and losses from foreign currency-denominated cash balances, vendor payables and tax-related receivables from the Australian government, generally reflecting the fluctuation of the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $102.1 million. We invest our cash in money market funds, commercial paper, certificates of deposits and corporate bonds, with the primary objectives to preserve principal, provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk.\nSince our inception in November 2005, we have not generated any revenue and have incurred recurring net losses. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $289.6 million. Prior to our IPO in June 2014, we funded our operations primarily through sales of redeemable convertible preferred stock and, to a lesser extent, through the issuances of convertible promissory notes and a loan security agreement. From our inception through our IPO in June 2014, we received gross proceeds of $104.0 million from such transactions. During June 2014, we completed our IPO with net proceeds of $102.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions paid by us. We also incurred offering costs of $2.5 million related to the IPO. On January 28, 2015, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock, which resulted in the sale of 3,942,200 shares at a price of $35.00 per share. We received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of $130.0 million based upon the price of $35.00 per share and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions paid by us. We also incurred offering costs of $0.5 million related to the follow-on offering.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had fully repaid all outstanding amounts due under a loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Midcap Financial, or the 2014 Credit Facility, entered into in March 2014.\nOn December 29, 2017, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, or the Term Loan. The Term Loan provided for borrowings of $20.0 million. On December 29, 2017, we received proceeds of $20.0 million from the issuance of a promissory note. The promissory note issued under the Term Loan is collateralized by substantially all of our personal property, other than our intellectual property.\nUpon entering into this Term Loan, we are obligated to make monthly, interest-only payments until March 29, 2019 and, thereafter, to pay 33 consecutive, equal monthly installments of principal and interest from April 1, 2019 through December 1, 2021. The outstanding Term Loan bears a variable interest at an annual rate of 1.25% above the prime rate, which was 4.5% at December 31, 2017. In addition, a final payment equal to 8.0% of the Term Loan is due upon the earlier of the maturity date, acceleration of the term loans or prepayment of all or part of the term loans. We accrue the final payment amount of $1.6 million, to outstanding debt by charges to interest expense using the effective-interest method from the date of issuance through the maturity date.\nAdditionally, we, as the borrower, are required to maintain a minimum cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance at Silicon Valley Bank of no less than 105% of the total outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan, which as of December 31, 2017 was $21.0 million.\nFurther, as of 45 days after the Term Loan was entered in, we must maintain a balance of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at Silicon Valley Bank in an amount not less than the greater of (i) $55.0 million and (ii) sixty-five percent (65%) of all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. If we do not meet this requirement it will not be considered an event of default provided we immediately secure 87.5% of the principal balance in a restricted cash account.\nThere are negative covenants restricting our activities, including limitations on dispositions, mergers or acquisitions; encumbering or granting a security interest in our intellectual property; incurring indebtedness or liens; paying dividends; making certain investments; permit the aggregate value of cash maintained by our Australian subsidiary not to exceed $4.0 million and certain other business transactions.\nThe Term Loan also includes events of default, the occurrence and continuation of any of which provides the lenders the right to exercise remedies against us and the collateral securing the loans under the Term Loan, including cash in the amount of the outstanding balance. These events of default include, among other things, failure to pay any amounts due under the Term Loan, insolvency, the occurrence of a material adverse event, the occurrence of any default under certain other indebtedness and a final judgment against us in an amount greater than $0.3 million.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented below:\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(43,784 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(51,975 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(59,554 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(92,118 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,715 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>129,164 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,425 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,243 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(22,508 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Net cash used in operating activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, operating activities used $43.8 million of cash, resulting from our net loss of $52.0 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $8.3 million. Our net loss was primarily attributed to research and development activities related to our ZGN-1061 program, discovery and screening and our general and administrative expenses, as we had no revenue in the period. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2017, consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $8.3 million. Net cash used in changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2017, consisted primarily of a $1.0 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $0.6 million increase in tax incentive receivable.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, operating activities used $52.0 million of cash, resulting from our net loss of $57.9 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $5.5 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $11.4 million. Our net loss was primarily attributed to research and development activities related to our beloranib program, our ZGN-1061 program, and our general and administrative expenses, as we had no revenue in the period. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2016, consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $10.1 million. Net cash used in changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2016, consisted primarily of a $6.9 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $1.0 million decrease in tax incentive receivable.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, operating activities used $59.6 million of cash, resulting from our net loss of $74.3 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $8.0 million, and net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $6.7 million. Our net loss was primarily attributed to research and development activities related to our beloranib program, licensing milestones and our general and administrative expenses, as we had no revenue in the period. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2015, consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $8.6 million. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2015, consisted primarily of $4.9 million increase in accounts payable and a $3.2 million increase in accrued expenses, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $1.0 million increase in tax incentive receivable.\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, investing activities provided $35.6 million of cash resulting from proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $150.2 million, offset by the use of cash for purchases of marketable securities of $114.5 million and purchases of property and equipment of $0.1 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, investing activities provided $51.4 million of cash resulting from proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $188.6 million, offset by the use of cash for purchases of marketable securities of $136.5 million and purchases of property and equipment of $0.7 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, investing activities used $92.1 million of cash resulting from purchases of marketable securities of $287.5 million and purchases of equipment of $0.6 million. These uses were partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $196.0 million.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities of $16.6 million was the result of proceeds of $20.0 million from our notes payable, as well as $0.2 million received from proceeds relating to the exercise of common stock options and common stock purchased under our 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, partially offset by payments of $3.6 million related to our notes payable.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, financing activities used $2.9 million for payments related to our notes payable, partially offset by $0.2 million received from proceeds relating to the exercise of common stock options and common stock purchased under our 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $129.2 million as a result of proceeds of $129.6 million from our follow-on public offering, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, as well as $1.0 million received from proceeds relating to the exercise of common stock options, offset by payments of $1.4 million related to our note payable.\nOperating Capital Requirements\nZGN-1061 is currently in Phase 2 clinical development, therefore we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will continue to incur expenses, if and as we:\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>advance the development of ZGN-1061 through Phase 2 clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>advance the development of ZGN-1258 through nonclinical and clinical development and if successful, later-stage clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>seek to identify additional product candidates and indications for our product candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>seek to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>add operational, financial and management information systems; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>add personnel, including personnel to support our product development and future commercialization; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>maintain, leverage and expand our intellectual property portfolio. </td> </tr>\n</table> We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2017, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least one year from the issuance date of this Annual Report. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development ZGN-1061 and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for the development of these product candidates is unknown, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates. Our future capital requirements for ZGN-1061 will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the costs of future research and development activities, including clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the extent to which we acquire or in-license other products, product candidates, or technologies; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>our ability to establish any future collaboration arrangements on favorable terms, if at all. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends and may require the issuance of warrants, which could potentially dilute their ownership interest. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nSince our inception in 2005, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or our earned tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. As of December 31, 2017, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $54.0 million and $39.6 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2030, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we also had available tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $14.8 million and $2.4 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2021, respectively We have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change, generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in the equity ownership of our corporate entity over a three-year period, has occurred or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since our inception, due to the significant costs and complexities associated with such studies. Accordingly, our ability to utilize our tax carryforwards may be limited. Additionally, U.S. tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be utilized against future taxes. As a result, we may not be able to take full advantage of these carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods:\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total (2) (3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease commitments (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>479 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt commitments (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>479 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>We entered into an operating lease for office space in Boston, Massachusetts on May 15, 2014, effective as of July 28, 2014, with a term expiring on July 31, 2017, and an option to extend the lease for three additional years.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our \u201cSelected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results described, in or implied by, these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed above in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements made by us, which speak only as of the date they are made. We disclaim any obligation, except as specifically required by law and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to significantly improving the health and well-being of patients affected by type 2 diabetes, Prader-Willi syndrome, or PWS, and potentially other metabolically related disorders. We are focused on developing novel therapeutics that treat the underlying biological mechanisms through the methionine aminopeptidase 2, or MetAP2, pathway. We have pioneered the study of MetAP2 inhibitors in both common and rare forms of obesity. Our lead product candidate is ZGN-1061, a novel fumagillin-class MetAP2 inhibitor administered by subcutaneous injection, which is currently being profiled for its utility in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other related metabolic disorders. We have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of ZGN-1061 in the Netherlands, which was comprised of a single ascending dose, or SAD, portion and a multiple ascending dose, or MAD, portion. This clinical trial evaluated ZGN-1061 for safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics while also gaining an early indication of efficacy over four weeks of treatment. We reported positive top line results from this clinical trial in May 2017 and presented the full data package at the American Diabetes Association's 77th Annual Scientific Sessions in June 2017. In this Phase 1 assessment ZGN-1061 demonstrated rapid drug absorption and clearance in line with criteria established in advance for the molecule, and had a favorable tolerability profile with no safety signals identified, including no evidence of pro-thrombotic effects. The data show that ZGN-1061 treatment causes improvements across multiple metabolic measures consistent with MetAP2 inhibition, and patients in the clinical trial experienced mean weight loss of up to approximately one pound per week. In the third quarter of 2017, we advanced ZGN-1061 into a Phase 2 clinical trial in both Australia and New Zealand, in patients with type 2 diabetes who are obese and are failing to respond adequately to current therapies. In March 2018, we reported results of an interim analysis of this clinical trial. We expect to report full results of the core part of this clinical trial mid-year 2018, and the results of the entire trial, including the additional arm recently added to the trial, early in 2019. In January 2018, we announced advancement of our highly optimized MetAP2 development candidate ZGN-1258, and in the first quarter of 2018, initiated investigational new drug, or IND, application enabling nonclinical efforts for evaluation in the treatment of people affected by PWS. We anticipate filing an IND application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and beginning Phase 1 clinical development by the end of 2018.\nZGN-1061 was discovered by our researchers as part of a multi-year campaign to identify novel compounds that avoided limiting nonclinical safety concerns observed with our first-generation compound. The compound has similar potency, and range of desired pharmacological activities in animal models as other MetAP2 inhibitors, including beloranib. ZGN-1061 displays broadly improved safety margins in nonclinical studies, supporting the value of the compound as a more highly optimized drug product candidate.\nZGN-1061 acts through potent inhibition of MetAP2, an enzyme that modulates the activity of key cellular processes that control metabolism. MetAP2 inhibitors work, at least in part, by directing MetAP2 binding to\ncellular stress and growth factor mediators, thereby reducing the tone of signals that drive lipid synthesis by the liver and fat storage throughout the body. In this manner, MetAP2 inhibition serves the purpose of re-establishing balance to the ways the body stores and metabolizes fat and glucose. MetAP2 inhibitors reduce the production of new fatty acid molecules by the liver and help convert stored fats into useful energy, while stimulating use of glucose and fats as an energy source. In the setting of type 2 diabetes, these processes lead to improvement of glycemic control.\nZGN-1258 was also discovered by our researchers as part of a multi-year campaign to identify novel compounds that avoided limiting nonclinical safety concerns observed with our first-generation compound. The compound has similar potency, and range of desired pharmacological activities in animal models as other MetAP2 inhibitors, including beloranib. ZGN-1258 displays broadly improved safety margins in nonclinical studies, supporting the value of the compound as a more highly optimized drug product candidate.\nZGN-1258 acts through potent inhibition of MetAP2. Like other MetAP2 inhibitors, ZGN-1258 modulates the activity of key cellular processes that control metabolism and impact lipid synthesis and storage throughout the body and leads to increase use of stored fats as an energy source. ZGN-1258 displays enhanced uptake into the brain and displays greater potency and activity in animal models of hyperphagic behaviors relative to other compounds including ZGN-1061. These differences support the use of ZGN-1258 in higher need indications such as PWS, in which brain activity is likely to be more important for therapeutic effect. Treatment of obese and hyperphagic animals with ZGN-1258 leads to reduction in both pathologic food intake and rapid body weight loss, making it of interest in the treatment of severe forms of human obesity.\nSince our inception in November 2005, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing ZGN-1061, beloranib, ZGN-839, ZGN-1258 and additional MetAP2 inhibitors, building our intellectual property portfolio, developing our supply chain, business planning, raising capital, and providing general and administrative support for such operations. From our inception through our initial public offering, or IPO, in June 2014, we received gross proceeds of $104.0 million from sales of redeemable convertible preferred stock and, to a lesser extent, through the issuances of convertible promissory notes. During June 2014, we completed our IPO with net proceeds of $102.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions paid by us. On January 28, 2015, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock, with net proceeds of $130.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions paid by us.\nWe have never generated any revenue and have incurred net losses in each year since our inception. We have an accumulated deficit of $289.6 million as of December 31, 2017. Our net loss was $52.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $57.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. These losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with in-licensing of beloranib, research and development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe expect to continue to incur expenses in connection with our ongoing activities, if and as we:\n \u2022 advance the development of ZGN-1061 through Phase 2 clinical trials; \n \u2022 advance the development of ZGN-1258 through nonclinical and clinical development; \n \u2022 seek to identify and advance development of additional product candidates into clinical development and indications for our product candidates; \n \u2022 seek to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates; \n \u2022 add operational, financial and management information systems; \n \u2022 add personnel, including personnel to support our product development and future commercialization; and \n \u2022 maintain, leverage and expand our intellectual property portfolio. \nAs a result, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations. Until such time that we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public, private equity, debt financings, or other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. Arrangements with collaborators or others may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates. In addition, we may never successfully complete development of any of our product candidates, obtain adequate patent protection for our technology, obtain necessary regulatory approval for our product candidates or achieve commercial viability for any approved product candidates. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.\nWe expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2017, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least one year from the issuance date of this Annual Report. See \u201c-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nWe have not generated any revenue from product sales since our inception, and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future. If our development efforts result in clinical success and regulatory approval or collaboration agreements with third parties for our product candidates, we may generate revenue from those product candidates or collaborations.\nOperating Expenses\nThe majority of our operating expenses since inception have consisted primarily of research and development activities, and general and administrative costs.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses, which consist primarily of costs associated with our product research and development efforts, are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of:\n \u2022 personnel costs, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation for employees engaged in scientific research and development functions; \n \u2022 third-party contract costs relating to research, formulation, manufacturing, nonclinical studies and clinical trial activities; \n \u2022 external costs of outside consultants; \n \u2022 payments made under our third-party licensing agreements; \n \u2022 sponsored research agreements; \n \u2022 laboratory consumables; and \n \u2022 allocated facility-related costs.  We are currently primarily focused on developing ZGN-1061, ZGN-1258 and other early research activities and typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our research and development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, external consultant costs, payments made under our licensing agreements or other internal costs to specific development programs or product candidates unless the payments are specifically identifiable to a development program or product candidate. We record our research and development expenses net of any research and development tax incentives we are entitled to receive from government authorities.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we pursue later stages of clinical development of our product candidates.\nWe cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical trials of our product candidates or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. The duration, costs, and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:\n \u2022 the scope, rate of progress, and expense of clinical trials and other research and development activities; \n \u2022 clinical trial results; \n \u2022 uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rate or design; \n \u2022 significant and changing government regulation; \n \u2022 the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals; and \n \u2022 the FDA's or other regulatory authority's influence on clinical trial design.  A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA, or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, consisting of salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation, of our executive, finance, business and corporate development and other administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include travel expenses, allocated facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, insurance expenses, and professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services, including legal expenses to pursue patent protection of our intellectual property. We expect that general and administrative expenses will remain relatively consistent during 2018 as compared to 2017.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest income. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our interest income has not been significant due to low interest earned on invested balances. We anticipate that our interest income will decrease as we continue to incur operating losses.\nInterest expense. Interest expense during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, relates to outstanding borrowings under the 2014 Credit Facility, consisting of the stated interest of 8.1% per year due on outstanding borrowings, a final payment of 6% of amounts drawn down that was recorded as interest expense over the term through the maturity date using the effective-interest method, the amortization of deferred financing costs, the accretion of debt discounts relating to the 2014 Credit Facility. Interest expense in 2018 will relate to the Term Loan of $20.0 million, which closed on December 29, 2017. It bears a variable interest at an annual rate of 1.25% above the prime rate, as well as a final payment equal to 8.0% of the Term Loan is being recorded as interest expense over the term through the maturity date using the effective-interest method.\nForeign currency gains (losses), net. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses), net consists of the realized and unrealized gains and losses from foreign currency-denominated cash balances, vendor payables and tax-related receivables from the Australian government. We currently do not engage in hedging activities related to our foreign currency-denominated receivables and payables; as such, we cannot predict the impact of future foreign currency transaction gains and losses on our operating results. See \u201c-Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\u201d\nIncome Taxes\nSince our inception in 2005, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or our earned tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. As of December 31, 2017, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $54.0 million and $39.6 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2030, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we also had available tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $14.8 million and $2.4 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2021, respectively.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, was signed into United States law. The TCJA includes a number of changes to existing tax law, including, among other things, a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 34% down to a flat rate of 21%, effective as of January 1, 2018, as well as limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of annual taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, in each case, for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 (though any such net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely). The tax rate change resulted in a reduction in the gross amount of our deferred tax assets recorded as of December 31, 2017 with an offsetting reduction in the related valuation allowance, resulting in no income tax expense or benefit being recognized as of the enactment date of the TCJA. In accordance with guidance in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, the final determination of the remeasurement of our deferred assets and liabilities will be completed as additional information becomes available, but no later than one year from the date of enactment of the 2017 Tax Act.\nJOBS Act\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d As an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we are electing not to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision not to take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we are relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. As such, we have elected not to (i) provide an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions apply for a period of five years following the completion of our IPO in June 2014 or until we no longer meet the requirements of being an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d whichever is earlier.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We believe that the estimates and assumptions involved in the accounting policies described below may have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements and, therefore, consider these to be our critical accounting policies. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. See also Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information about these critical accounting policies as well as a description of our other significant accounting policies.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel and outside vendors to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n \u2022 contract research organizations, or CROs, in connection with clinical trials; \n \u2022 investigative sites or other providers in connection with clinical trials; \n \u2022 vendors in connection with nonclinical development activities; and \n \u2022 vendors related to product candidate manufacturing, development and distribution of clinical supplies. \nWe base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense, nonclinical expense, or manufacturing activities. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have historically issued equity awards to employees, directors and consultants, generally in the form of options to purchase shares of our common stock and, to a lesser extent, shares of restricted common stock. We measure stock-based awards granted to employees and directors at fair value on the date of grant and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the\nvesting period of the respective award. Generally, we issue stock options and restricted stock awards with only service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. We measure stock-based awards granted to consultants and nonemployees at the fair value of the award on the date at which the related service is complete. Compensation expense is recognized over the period during which services are rendered by such consultants and nonemployees until completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, the fair value of these awards is re-measured using the then-current fair value of our common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nWe estimate the fair value of each service-based stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Until completion of our IPO in June 2014, we were a private company and lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, we estimated our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our publicly traded peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded stock price. The expected term of our options has been determined utilizing the \u201csimplified\u201d method for awards that qualify as \u201cplain-vanilla\u201d options, while the expected term of our options granted to consultants and nonemployees has been determined based on the contractual term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nIn October 2017, we granted market-based stock option awards which are valued using Monte Carlo simulation models. The number of options expected to vest, based on achievement of the specified market condition, is factored into the grant date Monte Carlo valuations. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the attribution period.\nThe assumptions we used to determine the fair value of service-based stock options granted to employees and directors are as follows, presented on a weighted average basis:\n The assumptions that we used to determine the fair value of the market-based stock options granted to employees are as follows, presented on a weighted average basis:\n These assumptions represented our best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different. We recognize compensation expense for only the portion of awards that are expected to vest.\nThe following table summarizes the classification of our stock-based compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss:\n As of December 31, 2017, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to our unvested service-based stock option awards of $10.7 million, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average vesting period of 2.54 years.\nAs of", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our \u201cSelected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results described, in or implied by, these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed above in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements made by us, which speak only as of the date they are made. We disclaim any obligation, except as specifically required by law and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to significantly improving the health and well-being of patients affected by type 2 diabetes, Prader-Willi syndrome, or PWS, and potentially other metabolically related disorders. We are focused on developing novel therapeutics that treat the underlying biological mechanisms through the methionine aminopeptidase 2, or MetAP2, pathway. We have pioneered the study of MetAP2 inhibitors in both common and rare forms of obesity. Our lead product candidate is ZGN-1061, a novel fumagillin-class MetAP2 inhibitor administered by subcutaneous injection, which is currently being profiled for its utility in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other related metabolic disorders. We have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of ZGN-1061 in the Netherlands, which was comprised of a single ascending dose, or SAD, portion and a multiple ascending dose, or MAD, portion. This clinical trial evaluated ZGN-1061 for safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics while also gaining an early indication of efficacy over four weeks of treatment. We reported positive top line results from this clinical trial in May 2017 and presented the full data package at the American Diabetes Association's 77th Annual Scientific Sessions in June 2017. In this Phase 1 assessment ZGN-1061 demonstrated rapid drug absorption and clearance in line with criteria established in advance for the molecule, and had a favorable tolerability profile with no safety signals identified, including no evidence of pro-thrombotic effects. The data show that ZGN-1061 treatment causes improvements across multiple metabolic measures consistent with MetAP2 inhibition, and patients in the clinical trial experienced mean weight loss of up to approximately one pound per week. In the third quarter of 2017, we advanced ZGN-1061 into a Phase 2 clinical trial in both Australia and New Zealand, in patients with type 2 diabetes who are obese and are failing to respond adequately to current therapies. In March 2018, we reported results of an interim analysis of this clinical trial. We expect to report full results of the core part of this clinical trial mid-year 2018, and the results of the entire trial, including the additional arm recently added to the trial, early in 2019. In January 2018, we announced advancement of our highly optimized MetAP2 development candidate ZGN-1258, and in the first quarter of 2018, initiated investigational new drug, or IND, application enabling nonclinical efforts for evaluation in the treatment of people affected by PWS. We anticipate filing an IND application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and beginning Phase 1 clinical development by the end of 2018.\nZGN-1061 was discovered by our researchers as part of a multi-year campaign to identify novel compounds that avoided limiting nonclinical safety concerns observed with our first-generation compound. The compound has similar potency, and range of desired pharmacological activities in animal models as other MetAP2 inhibitors, including beloranib. ZGN-1061 displays broadly improved safety margins in nonclinical studies, supporting the value of the compound as a more highly optimized drug product candidate.\nZGN-1061 acts through potent inhibition of MetAP2, an enzyme that modulates the activity of key cellular processes that control metabolism. MetAP2 inhibitors work, at least in part, by directing MetAP2 binding to\ncellular stress and growth factor mediators, thereby reducing the tone of signals that drive lipid synthesis by the liver and fat storage throughout the body. In this manner, MetAP2 inhibition serves the purpose of re-establishing balance to the ways the body stores and metabolizes fat and glucose. MetAP2 inhibitors reduce the production of new fatty acid molecules by the liver and help convert stored fats into useful energy, while stimulating use of glucose and fats as an energy source. In the setting of type 2 diabetes, these processes lead to improvement of glycemic control.\nZGN-1258 was also discovered by our researchers as part of a multi-year campaign to identify novel compounds that avoided limiting nonclinical safety concerns observed with our first-generation compound. The compound has similar potency, and range of desired pharmacological activities in animal models as other MetAP2 inhibitors, including beloranib. ZGN-1258 displays broadly improved safety margins in nonclinical studies, supporting the value of the compound as a more highly optimized drug product candidate.\nZGN-1258 acts through potent inhibition of MetAP2. Like other MetAP2 inhibitors, ZGN-1258 modulates the activity of key cellular processes that control metabolism and impact lipid synthesis and storage throughout the body and leads to increase use of stored fats as an energy source. ZGN-1258 displays enhanced uptake into the brain and displays greater potency and activity in animal models of hyperphagic behaviors relative to other compounds including ZGN-1061. These differences support the use of ZGN-1258 in higher need indications such as PWS, in which brain activity is likely to be more important for therapeutic effect. Treatment of obese and hyperphagic animals with ZGN-1258 leads to reduction in both pathologic food intake and rapid body weight loss, making it of interest in the treatment of severe forms of human obesity.\nSince our inception in November 2005, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing ZGN-1061, beloranib, ZGN-839, ZGN-1258 and additional MetAP2 inhibitors, building our intellectual property portfolio, developing our supply chain, business planning, raising capital, and providing general and administrative support for such operations. From our inception through our initial public offering, or IPO, in June 2014, we received gross proceeds of $104.0 million from sales of redeemable convertible preferred stock and, to a lesser extent, through the issuances of convertible promissory notes. During June 2014, we completed our IPO with net proceeds of $102.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions paid by us. On January 28, 2015, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock, with net proceeds of $130.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions paid by us.\nWe have never generated any revenue and have incurred net losses in each year since our inception. We have an accumulated deficit of $289.6 million as of December 31, 2017. Our net loss was $52.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $57.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. These losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with in-licensing of beloranib, research and development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe expect to continue to incur expenses in connection with our ongoing activities, if and as we:\n \u2022 advance the development of ZGN-1061 through Phase 2 clinical trials; \n \u2022 advance the development of ZGN-1258 through nonclinical and clinical development; \n \u2022 seek to identify and advance development of additional product candidates into clinical development and indications for our product candidates; \n \u2022 seek to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates; \n \u2022 add operational, financial and management information systems; \n \u2022 add personnel, including personnel to support our product development and future commercialization; and \n \u2022 maintain, leverage and expand our intellectual property portfolio. \nAs a result, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations. Until such time that we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public, private equity, debt financings, or other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. Arrangements with collaborators or others may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates. In addition, we may never successfully complete development of any of our product candidates, obtain adequate patent protection for our technology, obtain necessary regulatory approval for our product candidates or achieve commercial viability for any approved product candidates. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.\nWe expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2017, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least one year from the issuance date of this Annual Report. See \u201c-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nWe have not generated any revenue from product sales since our inception, and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future. If our development efforts result in clinical success and regulatory approval or collaboration agreements with third parties for our product candidates, we may generate revenue from those product candidates or collaborations.\nOperating Expenses\nThe majority of our operating expenses since inception have consisted primarily of research and development activities, and general and administrative costs.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses, which consist primarily of costs associated with our product research and development efforts, are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of:\n \u2022 personnel costs, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation for employees engaged in scientific research and development functions; \n \u2022 third-party contract costs relating to research, formulation, manufacturing, nonclinical studies and clinical trial activities; \n \u2022 external costs of outside consultants; \n \u2022 payments made under our third-party licensing agreements; \n \u2022 sponsored research agreements; \n \u2022 laboratory consumables; and \n \u2022 allocated facility-related costs.  We are currently primarily focused on developing ZGN-1061, ZGN-1258 and other early research activities and typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our research and development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, external consultant costs, payments made under our licensing agreements or other internal costs to specific development programs or product candidates unless the payments are specifically identifiable to a development program or product candidate. We record our research and development expenses net of any research and development tax incentives we are entitled to receive from government authorities.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we pursue later stages of clinical development of our product candidates.\nWe cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical trials of our product candidates or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. The duration, costs, and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:\n \u2022 the scope, rate of progress, and expense of clinical trials and other research and development activities; \n \u2022 clinical trial results; \n \u2022 uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rate or design; \n \u2022 significant and changing government regulation; \n \u2022 the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals; and \n \u2022 the FDA's or other regulatory authority's influence on clinical trial design.  A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA, or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, consisting of salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation, of our executive, finance, business and corporate development and other administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include travel expenses, allocated facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, insurance expenses, and professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services, including legal expenses to pursue patent protection of our intellectual property. We expect that general and administrative expenses will remain relatively consistent during 2018 as compared to 2017.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest income. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our interest income has not been significant due to low interest earned on invested balances. We anticipate that our interest income will decrease as we continue to incur operating losses.\nInterest expense. Interest expense during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, relates to outstanding borrowings under the 2014 Credit Facility, consisting of the stated interest of 8.1% per year due on outstanding borrowings, a final payment of 6% of amounts drawn down that was recorded as interest expense over the term through the maturity date using the effective-interest method, the amortization of deferred financing costs, the accretion of debt discounts relating to the 2014 Credit Facility. Interest expense in 2018 will relate to the Term Loan of $20.0 million, which closed on December 29, 2017. It bears a variable interest at an annual rate of 1.25% above the prime rate, as well as a final payment equal to 8.0% of the Term Loan is being recorded as interest expense over the term through the maturity date using the effective-interest method.\nForeign currency gains (losses), net. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses), net consists of the realized and unrealized gains and losses from foreign currency-denominated cash balances, vendor payables and tax-related receivables from the Australian government. We currently do not engage in hedging activities related to our foreign currency-denominated receivables and payables; as such, we cannot predict the impact of future foreign currency transaction gains and losses on our operating results. See \u201c-Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\u201d\nIncome Taxes\nSince our inception in 2005, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or our earned tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. As of December 31, 2017, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $54.0 million and $39.6 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2030, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we also had available tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $14.8 million and $2.4 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2021, respectively.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, was signed into United States law. The TCJA includes a number of changes to existing tax law, including, among other things, a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 34% down to a flat rate of 21%, effective as of January 1, 2018, as well as limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of annual taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, in each case, for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 (though any such net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely). The tax rate change resulted in a reduction in the gross amount of our deferred tax assets recorded as of December 31, 2017 with an offsetting reduction in the related valuation allowance, resulting in no income tax expense or benefit being recognized as of the enactment date of the TCJA. In accordance with guidance in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, the final determination of the remeasurement of our deferred assets and liabilities will be completed as additional information becomes available, but no later than one year from the date of enactment of the 2017 Tax Act.\nJOBS Act\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d As an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we are electing not to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision not to take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we are relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. As such, we have elected not to (i) provide an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions apply for a period of five years following the completion of our IPO in June 2014 or until we no longer meet the requirements of being an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d whichever is earlier.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We believe that the estimates and assumptions involved in the accounting policies described below may have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements and, therefore, consider these to be our critical accounting policies. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. See also Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information about these critical accounting policies as well as a description of our other significant accounting policies.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel and outside vendors to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n \u2022 contract research organizations, or CROs, in connection with clinical trials; \n \u2022 investigative sites or other providers in connection with clinical trials; \n \u2022 vendors in connection with nonclinical development activities; and \n \u2022 vendors related to product candidate manufacturing, development and distribution of clinical supplies. \nWe base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense, nonclinical expense, or manufacturing activities. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have historically issued equity awards to employees, directors and consultants, generally in the form of options to purchase shares of our common stock and, to a lesser extent, shares of restricted common stock. We measure stock-based awards granted to employees and directors at fair value on the date of grant and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the\nvesting period of the respective award. Generally, we issue stock options and restricted stock awards with only service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. We measure stock-based awards granted to consultants and nonemployees at the fair value of the award on the date at which the related service is complete. Compensation expense is recognized over the period during which services are rendered by such consultants and nonemployees until completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, the fair value of these awards is re-measured using the then-current fair value of our common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nWe estimate the fair value of each service-based stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Until completion of our IPO in June 2014, we were a private company and lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, we estimated our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our publicly traded peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded stock price. The expected term of our options has been determined utilizing the \u201csimplified\u201d method for awards that qualify as \u201cplain-vanilla\u201d options, while the expected term of our options granted to consultants and nonemployees has been determined based on the contractual term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nIn October 2017, we granted market-based stock option awards which are valued using Monte Carlo simulation models. The number of options expected to vest, based on achievement of the specified market condition, is factored into the grant date Monte Carlo valuations. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the attribution period.\nThe assumptions we used to determine the fair value of service-based stock options granted to employees and directors are as follows, presented on a weighted average basis:\nTable 213: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.75 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> The assumptions that we used to determine the fair value of the market-based stock options granted to employees are as follows, presented on a weighted average basis:\nTable 214: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.24 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> These assumptions represented our best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different. We recognize compensation expense for only the portion of awards that are expected to vest.\nThe following table summarizes the classification of our stock-based compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss:\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,543 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,930 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,163 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,652 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,933 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,582 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> As of December 31, 2017, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to our unvested service-based stock option awards of $10.7 million, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average vesting period of 2.54 years.\nAs of"}
