This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the supplemental financial data contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nFirst Defiance is a unitary thrift holding company that conducts business through the Subsidiaries, First Federal, First Insurance and First Defiance Risk Management.\nFirst Federal is a federally chartered stock savings bank that provides financial services to communities based in northwest Ohio, northeast Indiana, and southeastern Michigan where it operates 34 full service banking centers in twelve northwest Ohio counties, one northeast Indiana county, and one southeastern Michigan county. First Federal operates one loan production office in one central Ohio county.\nFirst Federal provides a broad range of financial services including checking accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, real estate mortgage loans, commercial loans, consumer loans, home equity loans and trust and wealth management services through its extensive branch network.\n\tFirst Insurance sells a variety of property and casualty, group health and life and individual health and life insurance products. First Insurance is an insurance agency that does business in the Defiance, Bryan, Bowling Green, Lima, Maumee and Oregon, Ohio areas. On September 1, 2015, First Insurance acquired a group medical benefits business from Buckeye Insurance Consultants, Inc. located in Lima, Ohio. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the Buckeye Insurance Consultants, Inc. acquisition.\nFirst Defiance Risk Management is a wholly owned insurance company subsidiary of the Company to insure the Company and its subsidiaries against certain risks unique to the operations of the Company and for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible in today's insurance marketplace. First Defiance Risk Management pools resources with several other similar insurance company subsidiaries of financial institutions to spread a limited amount of risk among themselves. First Defiance Risk Management was incorporated on December 20, 2012.\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 36 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Condition\nAssets at December 31, 2015 totaled $2.30 billion compared to $2.18 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of $118.7 million or 5.4%. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $33.2 million to $79.8 million at December 31, 2015 from $112.9 million at December 31, 2014. The increase in assets was due to an increase in loans receivable, net of undisbursed loan funds and deferred fees and costs, of $155.4 million funded by increases in total deposits of $75.3 million and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of $38.4 million as well as from cash and cash equivalents.\nSecurities\nThe securities portfolio decreased $3.0 million to $236.7 million at December 31, 2015. The 2015 activity in the portfolio included $30.4 million of purchases, $719,000 of amortization and maturities, $31.3 million of principal pay-downs and $426,000 of securities being sold. There was a net decrease of $1.0 million in market value on available-for-sale securities. For additional information regarding First Defiance's investment securities see Note 5 to the financial statements.\nLoans\nLoans receivable, net of undisbursed loan funds and deferred fees and costs, increased $155.4 million to $1.80 billion at December 31, 2015. For more details on the loan balances, see Note 7 - Loans Receivable in the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nThe majority of First Defiance's non-residential real estate and commercial loans are to small and mid-sized businesses. The combined commercial, non-residential real estate and multi-family real estate loan portfolios totaled $1.37 billion and $1.24 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and accounted for approximately 73.1% and 73.6% of First Defiance's loan portfolio at the end of those respective periods. First Defiance believes it has been able to establish itself as a leader in its market area in the commercial and commercial real estate lending area by hiring experienced lenders and providing a high level of customer service to its commercial lending clients.\nThe one-to-four family residential portfolio totaled $205.3 million at December 31, 2015, compared with $206.4 million at the end of 2014. At the end of 2015, those loans comprised 11.0% of the total loan portfolio, down from 12.2% at December 31, 2014.\nConstruction loans, which include one-to-four family and commercial real estate properties, increased to $163.9 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $112.4 million at December 31, 2014. These loans accounted for approximately 8.7% and 6.7% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nHome equity and home improvement loans increased to $117.0 million at December 31, 2015, from $111.8 million at the end of 2014. At the end of 2015, those loans comprised 6.3% of the total loan portfolio, down slightly from 6.6% at December 31, 2014.\nConsumer finance and mobile home loans were $16.3 million at December 31, 2015 up from $15.5 million at the end of 2014. These loans comprised just 0.9% of the total portfolio at both December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nIn order to properly assess the collateral dependent loans included in its loan portfolio, the Company has established policies regarding the monitoring of the collateral underlying such loans. The Company requires an appraisal that is less than one year old for all new collateral dependent real estate loans, and all renewed collateral dependent real estate loans where significant new money is extended. The appraisal process is handled by the Credit Department, which selects the appraiser and orders the appraisal. First Defiance's loan policy prohibits the account officer from talking or communicating with the appraiser to insure that the appraiser is not influenced by the account officer in any way in making a determination of value.\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 37 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFirst Federal generally does not require updated appraisals for performing loans unless significant new money is requested by the borrower.\nWhen a collateral dependent loan is downgraded to classified status, First Federal reviews the most current appraisal on file and if appropriate, based on First Federal's assessment of the appraisal, such as age, market, etc. First Federal will discount the appraisal amount to a more appropriate current value based on inputs from lenders and realtors. This amount may then be discounted further by First Federal's estimation of the selling costs. In most instances, if the appraisal is more than twelve to fifteen months old, a new appraisal may be required. Finally, First Federal assesses whether there is any collateral short fall, taking into consideration guarantor support and liquidity, and determines if a charge off is necessary.\nAll loans over 90 days past due and/or on non-accrual are classified as non-performing loans. Non-performing status automatically occurs in the month in which the 90-day delinquency occurs. When a collateral dependent loan moves to non-performing status, First Federal generally gets a new third party appraisal and charges the loan down appropriately based upon the new appraisal and an estimate of costs to liquidate the collateral. All properties that are moved into the Other Real Estate Owned ( OREO\u201d) category are supported by current appraisals, and the OREO is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, which is determined based on appraised value less First Federal's estimate of the liquidation costs.\nFirst Federal does not adjust any appraisals upward without written documentation of this valuation change from the appraiser. When setting reserves and charge offs on classified loans, appraisal values may be discounted downward based upon First Federal's experience with liquidating similar properties.\nAppraisals are received within approximately 60 days after they are requested. The First Federal Loan Loss Reserve Committee reviews the amount of each new appraisal and makes any necessary charge off decisions at its meeting prior to the end of each quarter.\nAny partially charged-off collateral dependent loans are considered non-performing, and as such, would need to show an extended period of time with satisfactory payment performance as well as cash flow coverage capability supported by current financial statements before First Federal will consider an upgrade to performing status. First Federal may consider moving the loan to accruing status after approximately six months of satisfactory payment performance.\nFor loans where First Federal determines that an updated appraisal is not necessary, other means are used to verify the value of the real estate, such as recent sales of similar properties on which First Federal had loans as well as calls to appraisers, brokers, realtors and investors. First Federal monitors and tracks its loan to value quarterly to determine accuracy and any necessary charge offs. Based on these results, changes may occur in the processes used.\nLoan modifications constitute a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d) if First Federal for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. For loans that are considered TDRs, First Federal either computes the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original loan's effective interest rate or it may measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral. For those loans measured for impairment utilizing the present value of future cash flows method, any discount is carried as a reserve in the allowance for loan and lease losses. For those loans measured for impairment utilizing the fair value of the collateral, any shortfall is charged off. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, First Federal had $11.2 million and $24.7 million, respectively, of loans that were still performing and which were classified as TDRs.\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 38 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of the estimated probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date. Management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses regularly through reviews of the loan portfolio. Consideration is given to economic conditions, changes in interest rates and the effect of such changes on collateral values and borrower's ability to pay, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and trends in past due and non-performing loan balances. The allowance for loan losses is a material estimate that is susceptible to significant fluctuation and is established through a provision for loan losses based on management's evaluation of the inherent risk in the loan portfolio. In addition to extensive in-house loan monitoring procedures, the Company utilizes an outside party to conduct an independent loan review of commercial loan and commercial real estate loan relationships. The goal is to have approximately 55% to 60% of the portfolio reviewed annually. This includes all relationships over $5.0 million with new exposure greater than $2.0 million and a sample of other relationships greater than $5.0 million; loan relationships between $1.0 million and $5.0 million with new exposure greater than $750,000 and a sample of other relationships between $1.0 million and $5.0 million; and a sample of relationships less than $1.0 million. Management utilizes the results of this outside loan review to assess the effectiveness of its internal loan grading system as well as to assist in the assessment of the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses associated with these types of loans.\nThe allowance for loan loss is made up of two basic components. The first component of the allowance for loan loss is the specific reserve in which the Company sets aside reserves based on the analysis of individual impaired credits. In establishing specific reserves, the Company analyzes all substandard, doubtful and loss graded loans quarterly and makes judgments about the risk of loss based on the cash flow of the borrower, the value of any collateral and the financial strength of any guarantors. If the loan is impaired and cash flow dependent, then a specific reserve is established for the discount on the net present value of expected future cash flows. If the loan is impaired and collateral dependent, then any shortfall is usually charged off. The Company also considers the impacts of any Small Business Association or Farm Service Agency guarantees. The specific reserve was $437,000 at December 31, 2015.\nThe second component is a general reserve, which is used to record loan loss reserves for groups of homogenous loans in which the Company estimates the losses incurred in the portfolio based on quantitative and qualitative factors. For purposes of the general reserve analysis, the loan portfolio is stratified into nine different loan pools based on loan type to allocate historic loss experience. The loss experience factor is then applied to the non-impaired loan portfolio. Beginning June 30, 2015, the Company refined the methodology to its allowance for loan loss calculation pertaining to the general reserve component for non-impaired loans. There was no change to the calculation of the component for reserves on impaired loans. Within the general reserve, the determination of the historical loss component was modified from using a three-year average annual loss rate to a loss migration measurement. The loss migration measurement implemented June 30, 2015, utilizes an average of four (4) four-year loss migration periods for each loan portfolio segment with differentiation between loan risk grades. This approach provides for a more precise reflection of probable incurred losses by risk grade within each loan portfolio segment over an average loan life cycle. Management believes that capturing the risk grade changes and cumulative losses over the life cycle of a loan more accurately depicts management's estimate of historical losses as well as being more reflective of the ongoing risks in the loan portfolio. Prior to June 30, 2015, the approach to this component quantified the historical loss by calculating a rolling twelve quarter average annual loss rate for each portfolio segment, without differentiation between loan risk grades. This modification resulted in a change in the general reserves between the loan portfolio segments but did not have a material impact on the overall allowance for loan losses.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 39 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe stratification of the loan portfolio and the change to loss migration measurement described above resulted in an increase to the quantitative general allowance to $9.8 million at December 31, 2015 from $7.8 million at December 31, 2014.\nIn addition to the quantitative analysis, a qualitative analysis is performed each quarter to provide additional general reserves on the non-impaired loan portfolio for various factors. The overall qualitative factors are based on nine sub-factors. The nine sub-factors have been aggregated into three qualitative factors: economic, environment and risk.\nECONOMIC\nTable 109: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>1) </td> <td>Changes in international, national and local economic business conditions and developments, including the condition of various market segments. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>2) </td> <td>Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nENVIRONMENT\nTable 111: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>3) </td> <td>Changes in the nature and volume in the loan portfolio. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>4) </td> <td>The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>5) </td> <td>Changes in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>6) </td> <td>Changes in the quality and breadth of the loan review process. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>7) </td> <td>Changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRISK\nTable 116: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>8) </td> <td>Changes in the trends of the volume and severity of delinquent and classified loans, and changes in the volume of non-accrual loans, trouble debt restructuring, and other loan modifications. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>9) </td> <td>Changes in the political and regulatory environment. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe qualitative analysis at December 31, 2015 indicated a general reserve of $15.2 million compared with $15.7 million at December 31, 2014. Management reviews the overall economic, environmental and risk factors quarterly and determines appropriate adjustments to these sub-factors based on that review.\nThe economic factors for commercial real estate and commercial loan segments were decreased slightly in 2015 due to the continued stability of the regional and national economy. However the economic factors for residential, home equity and construction loans, which had reflected lower economic risks, were increased to reflect changes in current market conditions.\nThe environmental factors have increased in 2015, primarily in the commercial real estate, commercial and construction loan segments due to the significant growth in balances achieved amidst highly competitive conditions on pricing and terms and balances generated from the expansion into the Columbus market through a new loan production office. There was also a continued increase in the volume of loans greater than $10 million and an increase in loans to our most significant borrowers, which was considered in our evaluation of concentrations and changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio.\nThe risk factors in all loan segments were decreased in 2015. With the introduction of the new loss migration model implemented in June 2015 to determine the quantitative loss component of the general reserve, management felt that estimation risk in the allowance methodology is diminishing. In addition, during 2015, there was a significant decrease in the level of non-accrual loans, troubled debt restructurings and OREO since December 31, 2014.\nFirst Defiance's general reserve percentages for main loan segments not otherwise classified ranged from 0.53% for construction loans to 1.96% for home equity and improvement loans.\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 40 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result of the quantitative and qualitative analysis, along with the change in specific reserves, the Company's provision for loan losses for 2015 was $136,000 compared to $1.1 million for 2014. The allowance for loan losses was $25.4 million at December 31, 2015 and $24.8 million at December 31, 2014 and represented 1.41% and 1.50% of loans, net of undisbursed loan funds and deferred fees and costs, respectively. The decrease in specific reserves and the lower level of charge offs was offset by the increase in the quantitative reserve. The provision was offset by charge offs of $1.2 million and recoveries of $1.7 million resulting in an increase to the overall allowance for loan loss of $616,000. In management's opinion, the overall allowance for loan losses of $25.4 million as of December 31, 2015 is adequate.\nManagement also assesses the value of OREO as of the end of each accounting period and recognizes write-downs to the value of that real estate in the income statement if conditions dictate. In 2015, First Defiance recorded OREO write-downs that totaled $724,000. These amounts were included in other non-interest expense. Management believes that the values recorded at December 31, 2015 for OREO and repossessed assets represent the realizable value of such assets.\nTotal classified loans increased slightly to $49.1 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $47.3 million at December 31, 2014.\nFirst Defiance's ratio of allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 156.1% at December 31, 2015 compared with 102.6% at December 31, 2014. Management monitors collateral values of all loans included on the watch list that are collateral dependent and believes that allowances for those loans at December 31, 2015 are appropriate.\nAt December 31, 2015, First Defiance had total non-performing assets of $17.6 million, compared to $30.3 million at December 31, 2014. Non-performing assets include loans that are 90 days past due, real estate owned and other assets held for sale.\nThe decrease in non-performing assets between December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 is in commercial real estate loans, commercial loans and real estate owned. The balance of commercial real estate non-performing loans was $5.3 million lower at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014. The balance of commercial non-performing loans was $1.9 million lower at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014. The balance of OREO was $4.9 million lower at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014.\nNon-performing loans in the single-family residential, commercial real estate and commercial loan categories represent 1.27%, 1.04% and 0.73% of the total loans in those categories respectively at December 31, 2015 compared to 1.61%, 1.81% and 1.25% respectively for the same categories at December 31, 2014. Management believes that the current allowance for loan losses is appropriate and that the provision for loan losses recorded in 2015 is consistent with both charge-off experience and the risk inherent in the overall credits in the portfolio.\nFirst Federal's Asset Review Committee meets monthly to review the status of work-out strategies for all criticized relationships, which include all non-accrual loans. Based on such factors as anticipated collateral values in liquidation scenarios, cash flow projections, assessment of net worth of guarantors and all other factors which may mitigate risk of loss, the Asset Review Committee makes recommendations regarding proposed charge-offs which are approved by the Senior Loan Committee or the Loan Loss Reserve Committee.\nFor the twelve months ended and as of December 31, 2015, commercial real estate, which represented 50.71% of total loans, accounted for a net recovery of 93.33% and 60.56% of nonaccrual loans, and commercial loans, which represented 22.42% of total loans, accounted for 54.79% of net recoveries and 18.93% of nonaccrual loans. For the twelve months ended and as of December 31, 2014, commercial real estate, which represented 49.84% of total loans, accounted for a net recovery of 126.98% and 62.88% of nonaccrual loans, and commercial loans, which represented 23.70% of total loans, accounted for 195.76% of net charge-offs and 20.69% of nonaccrual loans.\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 41 - </td> <td> </td>

</tr>\n</table>\nLoans Acquired with Impairment\nCertain loans acquired had evidence that the credit quality of the loan had deteriorated since its origination and, in management's assessment at the acquisition date, it was probable that First Defiance would be unable to collect all contractually required payments due. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 310 Subtopic 30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality, these loans were recorded based on management's estimate of the fair value of the loans.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the total contractual receivable for those loans was $361,000 and the recorded value was $169,000.\nHigh Loan-to-Value Mortgage Loans\nThe majority of First Defiance's mortgage loans are collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate, have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or less, and are made to borrowers in good credit standing. First Federal usually requires residential mortgage loan borrowers whose loan-to-value is greater than 80% to purchase private mortgage insurance ( PMI\u201d). Management also periodically reviews and monitors the financial viability of its PMI providers.\nFirst Federal originates and retains a limited number of residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios that exceed 80% where PMI is not required if the borrower possesses other demonstrable strengths. The loan-to-value ratios on these loans are generally limited to 85% and exceptions must be approved by First Federal's senior loan committee. Management monitors the balance of one-to-four family residential loans, including home equity loans and committed lines of credit that exceed certain loan to value standards (90% for owner occupied residences, 85% for non-owner occupied residences and one-to-four family construction loans, 75% for developed land and 65% for raw land). Total loans that exceed those standards described above at December 31, 2015 totaled $46.3 million, compared to $50.0 million at December 31, 2014. These loans are generally paying as agreed.\nFirst Defiance does not make interest-only first-mortgage residential loans, nor does it have residential mortgage loan products or other consumer products that allow negative amortization.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill was $61.8 million at December 31, 2015 and $61.5 million at December 31, 2014. The increase in goodwill is due to recording $273,000 of goodwill from the Buckeye acquisition that was completed in the third quarter of 2015. Core deposit intangibles and other intangible assets decreased to $1.9 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $2.4 million at December 31, 2014. During 2015, changes to the core deposit intangibles and other intangibles were due to the recognition of $699,000 of amortization expense offset by an increase of $163,000 due to the Buckeye acquisition. For more details on the Buckeye acquisition see Note 3 - Acquisitions. No impairment of goodwill was recorded in 2015 or 2014.\nDeposits\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2015 were $1.84 billion compared to $1.76 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of $75.3 million or 4.3%. Non-interest bearing checking accounts grew by $41.1 million, interest bearing checking accounts and money markets grew by $39.5 million, and savings grew by $16.0 million while retail certificates of deposit declined by $21.3 million. Management can utilize the national market for certificates of deposit to supplement its funding needs if necessary. For more details on the deposit balances in general see Note 11 - Deposits.\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 43 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBorrowings\nFHLB advances totaled $59.9 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $21.5 million at December 31, 2014. The balance at the end of 2015 includes $5.0 million of convertible advances with a rate of 2.35%. This advance is callable by the FHLB, at which point it would convert to a three-month LIBOR advance if not paid off. This advance has a final maturity date in 2018. In addition, First Defiance has ten fixed-rate advances totaling $47.0 million with rates ranging from 1.10% to 2.16% and one amortizing advance totaling $7.9 million with a rate of 1.78%.\nAt December 31, 2015, First Defiance also had $57.2 million of securities that were sold with agreements to repurchase, compared to $54.8 million at December 31, 2014.\nEquity\nTotal stockholders' equity increased $692,000 to $280.2 million at December 31, 2015. This increase is a result of net income of $26.4 million and capital of $1.5 million from the exercise of 73,800 net shares under stock option plans, which was mostly offset by the cost of $12.0 million to repurchase the warrant issued to the U.S. Treasury under the TARP Capital Purchase Program, $8.4 million from repurchasing 225,808 shares of common stock in 2015 and $7.2 million of common stock dividends being paid in 2015. In 2014, 553,136 shares were repurchased, resulting in a $15.5 million decrease in stockholders' equity, and 52,258 net shares were exercised under stock option plans resulting in a $921,000 increase in stockholder's equity.\nResults of Operations\nSummary\nFirst Defiance reported net income of $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $24.3 million and $22.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. On a diluted per common share basis, First Defiance earned $2.82 in 2015, $2.44 in 2014 and $2.19 in 2013.\nNet Interest Income\nFirst Defiance's net interest income is determined by its interest rate spread (i.e. the difference between the yields on its interest-earning assets and the rates paid on its interest-bearing liabilities) and the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nNet interest income was $74.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $69.7 million and $67.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The tax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.81%, 3.68% and 3.76% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The margin increased 13 basis points between 2014 and 2015. Interest-earning asset yields increased 14 basis points (to 4.15% in 2015 from 4.01% in 2014) and the cost of interest bearing liabilities between the two periods increased 1basis point (to 0.44% in 2015 from 0.43% in 2014).\nTotal interest income increased by $4.6 million or 6.0% to $80.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $76.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in interest income was due to the significant increase in loan volume and deploying lower yielding interest bearing deposit balances into higher yielding loans. The average balance of interest bearing deposits decreased to $59.4 million from $134.1 million at December 31, 2014. Interest income from loans increased to $73.3 million for 2015 compared to $68.7 million in 2014, which represents an increase of 6.8%.\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 44 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the same period, the average balance of investment securities increased to $239.9 million for 2015 from $223.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest income from investment securities increased to $6.8 million in 2015 compared to $6.6 million in 2014, which represents an increase of 3.0%. The overall duration of investments decreased to 4.2 years at December 31, 2015 from 4.9 years at December 31, 2014.\nInterest expense increased by $222,000 in 2015 compared to 2014, to $6.8 million from $6.6 million. This increase was mainly due to a one basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities in 2015. Interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits was $5.3 million in 2015 and 2014. Expenses on FHLB advances and other interest-bearing funding sources were $675,000 and $152,000 respectively in 2015 and $528,000 and $161,000 respectively in 2014. Interest expense recognized by the Company related to subordinated debentures was $613,000 in 2015 and $587,000 in 2014 due to rising rates.\nTotal interest income increased by $1.4 million or 2.0% to $76.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $74.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in interest income was due to a volume increase in loans and investment securities in 2014. Interest income from loans increased to $68.7 million for 2014 compared to $68.1 million in 2013, which represents an increase of 0.9%.\nDuring the same period, the average balance of investment securities increased to $223.5 million for 2014 from $191.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Interest income from investment securities increased to $6.6 million in 2014 compared to $5.6 million in 2013, which represents an increase of 17.5%. The overall duration of investments increased to 4.9 years at December 31, 2014 from 4.5 years at December 31, 2013.\nInterest expense decreased by $611,000 in 2014 compared to 2013, to $6.6 million from $7.2 million. This decrease was due to a six basis point decline in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities in 2014. Interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits was $5.3 million in 2014 and $5.9 million in 2013. Expenses on FHLB advances and other interest-bearing funding sources were $528,000 and $161,000 respectively in 2014 and $434,000 and $222,000 respectively in 2013. Interest expense recognized by the Company related to subordinated debentures was $587,000 in 2014 and $601,000 in 2013.\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 45 - </td> <td> </td>

million for December 31, 2013.\nProvisions for loan losses are charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management to absorb probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio. Factors considered by management include identifiable risk in the portfolios, historical experience, the volume and type of lending conducted by First Defiance, the amount of non-performing loans (including loans which meet the FASB ASC Topic 310 definition of impaired), the amount of loans graded by management as substandard, doubtful, or loss, general economic conditions (particularly as they relate to First Defiance's market areas); and other factors related to the collectability of First Defiance's loan portfolio. See also Allowance for Loan Losses in Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 7 to the audited financial statements.\nNoninterest Income - Noninterest income increased by $162,000 or 0.5% in 2015 to $31.8 million from $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. That followed an increase of $863,000 or 2.8% in 2014 from $30.8 million in 2013.\nService fees and other charges increased to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $10.3 million for 2014 and increased from $10.0 million for 2013. The increase in noninterest income in 2015 from 2014 is due to new fee structures and product redesigns that were implemented in the third quarter of 2014.\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 47 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFirst Federal's overdraft privilege program generally provides for the automatic payment of modest overdraft limits on all accounts deemed to be in good standing when the account is accessed using paper-based check processing, a teller withdrawal, a point-of-sale terminal, an ACH transaction, an online banking or voice-response transfer, or an ATM. To be in good standing, an account must be brought to a positive balance within a 30-day period and have not excessively used the overdraft privilege program. Overdraft limits are established for all customers without discrimination using a risk assessment approach for each account classification. The approach includes a systematic review and evaluation of the normal deposit flows made to each account classification to establish reasonable and prudent negative balance limits that would be routinely repaid by normal, expected and reoccurring deposits. The risk assessment by portfolio approach assumes a minimal degree of undetermined credit risk associated with unidentified individual accounts that are overdrawn for 30 or more days. Consumer accounts overdrawn for more than 60 days are automatically charged off. Fees are charged as a one-time fee per occurrence, up to five charges per day, and the fee charged for an item that is paid is equal to the fee charged for a non-sufficient fund item that is returned.\nOverdrawn balances, net of allowance for losses, are reflected as loans on First Defiance's balance sheet. The fees charged for this service are established based both on the return of processing costs plus a profit, and on the level of fees charged by competitors in the Company's market area for similar services. These fees are considered to be compensation for providing a service to the customer and therefore deemed to be noninterest income rather than interest income. Fee income recorded for the years ending December 31, 2015 and 2014 related to the overdraft privilege product, net of adjustments to the allowance for uncollectible overdrafts, were $2.8 million and $3.1 million, respectively. Accounts charged off are included in noninterest expense. The allowance for uncollectible overdrafts was $18,000 at December 31, 2015 and $16,000 at December 31, 2014.\nNoninterest income also includes gains, losses and impairment on investment securities. In 2015, First Defiance realized a $22,000 gain on sale of securities. In 2014, a $932,000 net gain was recognized compared to a $240,000 net loss in 2013. In 2013, First Defiance recognized other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) charges of $337,000 for certain impaired investment securities, where, in management's opinion, the value of the investment will not be recovered.\nMortgage banking income includes gains from the sale of mortgage loans, fees for servicing mortgage loans for others, an offset for amortization of mortgage servicing rights, and adjustments for impairment in the value of mortgage servicing rights. Mortgage banking income totaled $6.7 million, $5.6 million and $8.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The $1.1 million increase in 2015 from 2014 is attributable to a $1.2 million increase in the gain on sale of loans, along with a $150,000 positive change in the valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights. These were partially offset by an increase of $219,000 in mortgage servicing rights amortization expense. The positive valuation adjustment is a reflection of the increase in the fair value of certain sectors of the Company's portfolio of mortgage servicing rights. First Defiance originated $209.1 million of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market in 2015 compared with $153.8 million in 2014. The balance of the mortgage servicing right valuation allowance stands at $645,000 at the end of 2015. The $2.8 million decrease in mortgage banking income in 2014 from 2013 is attributable to a $2.4 million decrease in the gain on sale of loans and a $1.1 million negative change in the valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights partially offset by a decrease of $697,000 in mortgage servicing rights amortization expense. The negative valuation adjustment is a reflection of the decrease in the fair value of certain sectors of the Company's portfolio of mortgage servicing rights. First Defiance originated $153.8 million of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market in 2014 compared with $291.7 million in 2013. See Note 8 to the financial statements.\nGains on the sale of non-mortgages, which include SBA and FSA loans, totaled $824,000 in 2015 compared to $181,000 in 2014. The Company has built up its pipeline of eligible small business administration loans since 2014 and increased its selling efforts in 2015.\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 48 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInsurance commission income increased $217,000 or 2.2% to $10.1 million in 2015 from $9.9 million in 2014 mainly due to an increase in general production in the property and casualty and group employee benefits lines of business. Insurance commission income increased $232,000 or 2.4% to $9.9 million in 2014 from $9.6 million in 2013.\nIncome from bank owned life insurance decreased $907,000 or 50.3% to $895,000 in 2015 from $1.8 million in 2014 but increased slightly from $883,000 in 2013. The decrease in 2015 from 2014 is the result of a tax-free benefit from a bank-owned life insurance policy due to a death claim in 2014.\nOther income decreased $708,000 to $1.1 million in 2015 compared to $1.8 million in 2014 and $950,000 in 2013. The decrease in 2015 is mainly the result of a $498,000 tax-free gain realized in 2014 through the Company's deferred compensation plan trust attributable to the aforementioned death claim.\nNoninterest Expense - Total noninterest expense for 2015 was $67.9 million compared to $66.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $65.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nCompensation and benefits increased $2.2 million or 6.3% in 2015 to $37.8 million from $35.5 million in 2014. The increase in compensation and benefits is due to merit increases, staff additions for growth and an increase in incentive compensation as a direct reflection of the improved financial performance of the Company. Occupancy expense increased $514,000 or 7.7% to $7.2 million in 2015, from $6.7 million in 2014. The increase is attributable to projects relating to preventative maintenance and upkeep of the Company's branch network. Other non-interest expenses include the financial institutions tax and amortization of intangibles, decreased $1.7 million or 10.1% to $15.5 million in 2015 from $17.3 million in 2014. The decrease is due to $786,000 of costs in 2014 associated with the termination of First Federal's merger agreement with First Community Bank ( FCB\u201d).\nCompensation and benefits increased $1.2 million or 3.6% in 2014 to $35.5 million from $34.3 million in 2013. The increase in compensation and benefits is due to merit increases, higher health insurance costs and an increase in incentive expense as a direct reflection of the improved financial performance of the Company. Financial institutions tax, previously the state franchise tax, decreased $561,000 or 24.2% in 2014 to $1.8 million from $2.3 million in 2013 due to a change in the tax assessment calculation since switching in 2014 to the financial institution tax. Data processing increased $731,000 or 14.3% in 2014 to $5.9 million from $5.1 million in 2013 from the Company's ongoing projects to enhance product delivery coupled with an increase in electronic transaction volumes. The other noninterest expense category, excluding the financial institution tax, increased $483,000 primarily due to $786,000 in cost associated with the termination of First Federal's merger agreement with FCB. On February 18, 2014, the Company announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire FCB. On April 21, 2014, First Federal and FCB jointly announced the termination of the merger agreement. Both companies mutually agreed to terminate the agreement after it became evident that completion of the merger would take significantly longer than originally expected. This was mostly offset by lower OREO expenses in 2014.\nIncome Taxes - Income taxes totaled to $11.4 million in 2015 compared to $9.2 million in 2014 and $9.3 million in 2013. The effective tax rates for those years were 30.2%, 27.4%, and 29.4%, respectively. The tax rate is lower than the statutory 35% tax rate for the Company mainly because of investments in tax-exempt securities. The earnings on tax-exempt securities are not subject to federal income tax. See Note 18 - Income Taxes in the Notes to the financial statements for further details.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial institutions such as First Defiance generate income primarily through lending and investing activities. The risk of loss from lending and investing activities includes the possibility that losses may occur from the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of the loan or investment agreement. This possibility is known as credit risk.\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 49 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLending or investing activities that concentrate assets in a way that exposes the Company to a material loss from any single occurrence or group of occurrences increases credit risk. Diversifying loans and investments to prevent concentrations of risks is one way a financial institution can reduce potential losses due to credit risk. Examples of asset concentrations would include multiple loans made to a single borrower and loans of inappropriate size relative to the total capitalization of the institution. Management believes adherence to its loan and investment policies allows it to control its exposure to concentrations of credit risk at acceptable levels. First Defiance's loan portfolio is concentrated geographically in its northwest Ohio, northeast Indiana and southeast Michigan market areas. Management has also identified lending for income-generating rental properties as an industry concentration. Total loans for income- generating property totaled $564.1 million at December 31, 2015, which represents 30.2% of the Company's loan portfolio. Management believes it has the skill and experience to manage any risks associated with this type of lending. Loans in this category are generally paying as agreed without any unusual or unexpected levels of delinquency. The delinquency rate in this category, which is any loan 30 days or more past due, was 0.18% at December 31, 2015. There are no other industry concentrations that exceed 10% of the Company's loan portfolio.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company's primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base, raised through First Federal's branch network, along with wholesale sources of funding and its capital base. These funds, along with investment securities, provide the ability to meet the needs of depositors while funding new loan demand and existing commitments.\nCash generated from operating activities was $30.4 million, $30.1 million and $39.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by or used in operations during the periods presented consist primarily of proceeds from the sale of loans (less the origination of loans held for sale), the provision for loan losses, depreciation expense, the origination, amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing rights and increases and decreases in other assets and liabilities.\nThe primary investing activity of First Defiance is lending, which is funded with cash provided from operating and financing activities, as well as proceeds from payment on existing loans and proceeds from maturities of investment securities. In 2014 and 2013, the Company purchased $16.6 million and $4.5 million, respectively, in portfolio residential home loans. There were no purchases in 2015.\nIn considering the more typical investing activities, during 2015, $31.2 million and $426,000 was generated from the combination of maturity or pay-downs and the sale or call of available-for-sale investment securities, respectively, and $177.0 million was used by an increase in loans while $30.5 million was used to purchase available-for-sale investment securities. During 2014, $20.4 million and $14.9 million was generated from the combination of maturity or pay-downs and the sale or call of available-for-sale investment securities, respectively, and $73.2 million was used by an increase in loans while $70.1 million was used to purchase available-for-sale investment securities. During 2013, $35.1 million and $4.0 million was generated from the combination of maturity or pay-downs and the sale or call of available-for-sale investment securities, respectively, and $70.8 million was used by an increase in loans while $49.2 million was used to purchase available-for-sale investment securities.\nPrincipal financing activities include the gathering of deposits, the utilization of FHLB advances, and the sale of securities under agreements to repurchase such securities and borrowings from other banks. For 2015, total deposits increased by $75.3 million. For 2014, total deposits increased by $25.8 million. In 2015, securities sold under repurchase arrangements increased by $2.4 million. Also in 2015, the Company paid $7.2 million in common stock dividends coupled with paying $8.4 million in common stock repurchases. In 2014, securities sold under repurchase arrangements increased by $2.8 million. Also in 2014, the Company paid $5.9 million in common stock dividends coupled with paying $15.5 million in common stock repurchases.

At December 31, 2015, First Defiance had $452.0 million in capacity under its agreements with the FHLB.\nFirst Federal is subject to various capital requirements of the OCC. At December 31, 2015, First Federal had capital ratios that exceeded the standard to be considered well capitalized.\u201d For additional information about First Defiance and First Federal's capital requirements, see Note 17 - Regulatory Matters to the Consolidated December 31, 2015 Financial Statements.\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 51 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nFirst Defiance has established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States in the preparation of its financial statements. The significant accounting policies of First Defiance are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management, which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities; Management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates, which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of First Defiance.\nAllowance for Loan Losses - First Defiance believes the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements. In determining the appropriate estimate for the allowance for loan losses, management considers a number of factors relative to both specific credits in the loan portfolio and macro-economic factors relative to the economy of the United States as a whole and the economy of the northwest Ohio, northeast Indiana and southeast Michigan regions in which the Company does business.\nFactors relative to specific credits that are considered include a customer's payment history, a customer's recent financial performance, an assessment of the value of collateral held, knowledge of the customer's character, the financial strength and commitment of any guarantors, the existence of any customer or industry concentrations, changes in a customer's competitive environment and any other issues that may impact a customer's ability to meet his obligations.\nEconomic factors that are considered include levels of unemployment and inflation, specific plant or business closings in the Company's market area, the impact of strikes or other work stoppages, the impact of weather or environmental conditions, especially relative to agricultural borrowers, and other matters that may have an impact on the economy as a whole.\nIn addition to the identification of specific customers who may be potential credit problems, management considers its historical losses, the results of independent loan reviews, an assessment of the adherence to underwriting standards, and other factors in providing for loan losses that have not been specifically classified. Management believes that the level of its allowance for loan loss is sufficient to cover the estimates loss incurred but not yet recognized on the loan portfolio. Refer to the section titled Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d and Note 2, Statement of Accounting Policies for a further description of the Company's estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses.\nValuation of Mortgage Servicing Rights - First Defiance believes the valuation of mortgage servicing rights is a critical accounting policy that requires significant estimates in preparation of its consolidated financial statements. First Defiance recognizes as separate assets the value of mortgage servicing rights, which are acquired through loan origination activities. First Defiance does not purchase any mortgage servicing rights.\nKey assumptions made by management relative to the valuation of mortgage servicing rights include the stratification policy used in valuing servicing, assumptions relative to future prepayments of mortgages, the potential value of any escrow deposits maintained or ancillary income received as a result of the servicing activity and discount rates used to value the present value of a future cash flow stream. In assessing the value of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio, management utilizes a third party that specializes in valuing servicing portfolios. That third party reviews key assumptions with management prior to completing the valuation. Prepayment speeds are determined based on projected median prepayment speeds for 15 and 30 year mortgage backed securities. Those speeds are then adjusted up or down based on the size of the loan. The discount rate used in this analysis is the pretax yield generally required by purchasers of bulk servicing rights as of the valuation date. The value of mortgage servicing rights is especially vulnerable in a falling interest rate environment. Refer also to the section entitled Mortgage Servicing Rights and Note 2 - Statement of Accounting Policies, and Note 8 - Mortgage Banking, for a further description of First Defiance's valuation process, methodology and assumptions along with sensitivity analyses.\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 52 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill - First Defiance has two reporting units: First Federal and First Insurance. At December 31, 2015, First Defiance had goodwill of $61.8 million, including $51.0 million in First Federal, representing 83% of total goodwill and $10.8 million in First Insurance, representing 17% of total goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if it is determined appropriate. The evaluation for impairment involves comparing the current estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the current estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no additional testing is required and impairment loss is not recorded. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, further valuation procedures are performed and could result in impairment of goodwill being recorded. Further valuation procedures would include allocating the estimated fair value to all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value. If the implied value of goodwill of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nIf, for any future period First Defiance determines that there has been impairment in the carrying value of goodwill balances, First Defiance will record a charge to earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on net income, but not risk-based capital ratios.\nFirst Defiance has core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from acquisitions which are subject to amortization. First Defiance determines the amount of identifiable intangible assets based upon independent core deposit and customer relationship analyses at the time of the acquisition. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. No events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amount of any identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable had occurred during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 53 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>", "summary": "This report provides a comprehensive discussion of First Defiance's financial condition and operations.

This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the supplemental financial data contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nFirst Defiance is a unitary thrift holding company that conducts business through the Subsidiaries, First Federal, First Insurance and First Defiance Risk Management.\nFirst Federal is a federally chartered stock savings bank that provides financial services to communities based in northwest Ohio, northeast Indiana, and southeastern Michigan where it operates 34 full service banking centers in twelve northwest Ohio counties, one northeast Indiana county, and one southeastern Michigan county. First Federal operates one loan production office in one central Ohio county.\nFirst Federal provides a broad range of financial services including checking accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, real estate mortgage loans, commercial loans, consumer loans, home equity loans and trust and wealth management services through its extensive branch network.\n\tFirst Insurance sells a variety of property and casualty, group health and life and individual health and life insurance products. First Insurance is an insurance agency that does business in the Defiance, Bryan, Bowling Green, Lima, Maumee and Oregon, Ohio areas. On September 1, 2015, First Insurance acquired a group medical benefits business from Buckeye Insurance Consultants, Inc. located in Lima, Ohio. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the Buckeye Insurance Consultants, Inc. acquisition.\nFirst Defiance Risk Management is a wholly owned insurance company subsidiary of the Company to insure the Company and its subsidiaries against certain risks unique to the operations of the Company and for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible in today's insurance marketplace. First Defiance Risk Management pools resources with several other similar insurance company subsidiaries of financial institutions to spread a limited amount of risk among themselves. First Defiance Risk Management was incorporated on December 20, 2012.\n - 36 - \nFinancial Condition\nAssets at December 31, 2015 totaled $2.30 billion compared to $2.18 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of $118.7 million or 5.4%. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $33.2 million to $79.8 million at December 31, 2015 from $112.9 million at December 31, 2014. The increase in assets was due to an increase in loans receivable, net of undisbursed loan funds and deferred fees and costs, of $155.4 million funded by increases in total deposits of $75.3 million and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of $38.4 million as well as from cash and cash equivalents.\nSecurities\nThe securities portfolio decreased $3.0 million to $236.7 million at December 31, 2015. The 2015 activity in the portfolio included $30.4 million of purchases, $719,000 of amortization and maturities, $31.3 million of principal pay-downs and $426,000 of securities being sold. There was a net decrease of $1.0 million in market value on available-for-sale securities. For additional information regarding First Defiance's investment securities see Note 5 to the financial statements.\nLoans\nLoans receivable, net of undisbursed loan funds and deferred fees and costs, increased $155.4 million to $1.80 billion at December 31, 2015. For more details on the loan balances, see Note 7 - Loans Receivable in the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nThe majority of First Defiance's non-residential real estate and commercial loans are to small and mid-sized businesses. The combined commercial, non-residential real estate and multi-family real estate loan portfolios totaled $1.37 billion and $1.24 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and accounted for approximately 73.1% and 73.6% of First Defiance's loan portfolio at the end of those respective periods. First Defiance believes it has been able to establish itself as a leader in its market area in the commercial and commercial real estate lending area by hiring experienced lenders and providing a high level of customer service to its commercial lending clients.\nThe one-to-four family residential portfolio totaled $205.3 million at December 31, 2015, compared with $206.4 million at the end of 2014. At the end of 2015, those loans comprised 11.0% of the total loan portfolio, down from 12.2% at December 31, 2014.\nConstruction loans, which include one-to-four family and commercial real estate properties, increased to $163.9 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $112.4 million at December 31, 2014. These loans accounted for approximately 8.7% and 6.7% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nHome equity and home improvement loans increased to $117.0 million at December 31, 2015, from $111.8 million at the end of 2014. At the end of 2015, those loans comprised 6.3% of the total loan portfolio, down slightly from 6.6% at December 31, 2014.\nConsumer finance and mobile home loans were $16.3 million at December 31, 2015 up from $15.5 million at the end of 2014. These loans comprised just 0.9% of the total portfolio at both December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nIn order to properly assess the collateral dependent loans included in its loan portfolio, the Company has established policies regarding the monitoring of the collateral underlying such loans. The Company requires an appraisal that is less than one year old for all new collateral dependent real estate loans, and all renewed collateral dependent real estate loans where significant new money is extended. The appraisal process is handled by the Credit Department, which selects the appraiser and orders the appraisal. First Defiance's loan policy prohibits the account officer from talking or communicating with the appraiser to insure that the appraiser is not influenced by the account officer in any way in making a determination of value.\n - 37 - \nFirst Federal generally does not require updated appraisals for performing loans unless significant new money is requested by the borrower.\nWhen a collateral dependent loan is downgraded to classified status, First Federal reviews the most current appraisal on file and if appropriate, based on First Federal's assessment of the appraisal, such as age, market, etc. First Federal will discount the appraisal amount to a more appropriate current value based on inputs from lenders and realtors. This amount may then be discounted further by First Federal's estimation of the selling costs. In most instances, if the appraisal is more than twelve to fifteen months old, a new appraisal may be required. Finally, First Federal assesses whether there is any collateral short fall, taking into consideration guarantor support and liquidity, and determines if a charge off is necessary.\nAll loans over 90 days past due and/or on non-accrual are classified as non-performing loans. Non-performing status automatically occurs in the month in which the 90-day delinquency occurs. When a collateral dependent loan moves to non-performing status, First Federal generally gets a new third party appraisal and charges the loan down appropriately based upon the new appraisal and an estimate of costs to liquidate the collateral. All properties that are moved into the Other Real Estate Owned ( OREO\u201d) category are supported by current appraisals, and the OREO is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, which is determined based on appraised value less First Federal's estimate of the liquidation costs.\nFirst Federal does not adjust any appraisals upward without written documentation of this valuation change from the appraiser. When setting reserves and charge offs on classified loans, appraisal values may be discounted downward based upon First Federal's experience with liquidating similar properties.\nAppraisals are received within approximately 60 days after they are requested. The First Federal Loan Loss Reserve Committee reviews the amount of each new appraisal and makes any necessary charge off decisions at its meeting prior to the end of each quarter.\nAny partially charged-off collateral dependent loans are considered non-performing, and as such, would need to show an extended period of time with satisfactory payment performance as well as cash flow coverage capability supported by current financial statements before First Federal will consider an upgrade to performing status. First Federal may consider moving the loan to accruing status after approximately six months of satisfactory payment performance.\nFor loans where First Federal determines that an updated appraisal is not necessary, other means are used to verify the value of the real estate, such as recent sales of similar properties on which First Federal had loans as well as calls to appraisers, brokers, realtors and investors. First Federal monitors and tracks its loan to value quarterly to determine accuracy and any necessary charge offs. Based on these results, changes may occur in the processes used.\nLoan modifications constitute a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d) if First Federal for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. For loans that are considered TDRs, First Federal either computes the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original loan's effective interest rate or it may measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral. For those loans measured for impairment utilizing the present value of future cash flows method, any discount is carried as a reserve in the allowance for loan and lease losses. For those loans measured for impairment utilizing the fair value of the collateral, any shortfall is charged off. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, First Federal had $11.2 million and $24.7 million, respectively, of loans that were still performing and which were classified as TDRs.\n - 38 - \nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of the estimated probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date. Management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses regularly through reviews of the loan portfolio. Consideration is given to economic conditions, changes in interest rates and the effect of such changes on collateral values and borrower's ability to pay, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and trends in past due and non-performing loan balances. The allowance for loan losses is a material estimate that is susceptible to significant fluctuation and is established through a provision for loan losses based on management's evaluation of the inherent risk in the loan portfolio. In addition to extensive in-house loan monitoring procedures, the Company utilizes an outside party to conduct an independent loan review of commercial loan and commercial real estate loan relationships. The goal is to have approximately 55% to 60% of the portfolio reviewed annually. This includes all relationships over $5.0 million with new exposure greater than $2.0 million and a sample of other relationships greater than $5.0 million; loan relationships between $1.0 million and $5.0 million with new exposure greater than $750,000 and a sample of other relationships between $1.0 million and $5.0 million; and a sample of relationships less than $1.0 million. Management utilizes the results of this outside loan review to assess the effectiveness of its internal loan grading system as well as to assist in the assessment of the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses associated with these types of loans.\nThe allowance for loan loss is made up of two basic components. The first component of the allowance for loan loss is the specific reserve in which the Company sets aside reserves based on the analysis of individual impaired credits. In establishing specific reserves, the Company analyzes all substandard, doubtful and loss graded loans quarterly and makes judgments about the risk of loss based on the cash flow of the borrower, the value of any collateral and the financial strength of any guarantors. If the loan is impaired and cash flow dependent, then a specific reserve is established for the discount on the net present value of expected future cash flows. If the loan is impaired and collateral dependent, then any shortfall is usually charged off. The Company also considers the impacts of any Small Business Association or Farm Service Agency guarantees. The specific reserve was $437,000 at December 31, 2015.\nThe second component is a general reserve, which is used to record loan loss reserves for groups of homogenous loans in which the Company estimates the losses incurred in the portfolio based on quantitative and qualitative factors. For purposes of the general reserve analysis, the loan portfolio is stratified into nine different loan pools based on loan type to allocate historic loss experience. The loss experience factor is then applied to the non-impaired loan portfolio. Beginning June 30, 2015, the Company refined the methodology to its allowance for loan loss calculation pertaining to the general reserve component for non-impaired loans. There was no change to the calculation of the component for reserves on impaired loans. Within the general reserve, the determination of the historical loss component was modified from using a three-year average annual loss rate to a loss migration measurement. The loss migration measurement implemented June 30, 2015, utilizes an average of four (4) four-year loss migration periods for each loan portfolio segment with differentiation between loan risk grades. This approach provides for a more precise reflection of probable incurred losses by risk grade within each loan portfolio segment over an average loan life cycle. Management believes that capturing the risk grade changes and cumulative losses over the life cycle of a loan more accurately depicts management's estimate of historical losses as well as being more reflective of the ongoing risks in the loan portfolio. Prior to June 30, 2015, the approach to this component quantified the historical loss by calculating a rolling twelve quarter average annual loss rate for each portfolio segment, without differentiation between loan risk grades. This modification resulted in a change in the general reserves between the loan portfolio segments but did not have a material impact on the overall allowance for loan losses.\n - 39 - \nThe stratification of the loan portfolio and the change to loss migration measurement described above resulted in an increase to the quantitative general allowance to $9.8 million at December 31, 2015 from $7.8 million at December 31, 2014.\nIn addition to the quantitative analysis, a qualitative analysis is performed each quarter to provide additional general reserves on the non-impaired loan portfolio for various factors. The overall qualitative factors are based on nine sub-factors. The nine sub-factors have been aggregated into three qualitative factors: economic, environment and risk.\nECONOMIC\n 1) Changes in international, national and local economic business conditions and developments, including the condition of various market segments. \n 2) Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans. \nENVIRONMENT\n 3) Changes in the nature and volume in the loan portfolio. \n 4) The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations. \n 5) Changes in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices. \n 6) Changes in the quality and breadth of the loan review process. \n 7) Changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff. \nRISK\n 8) Changes in the trends of the volume and severity of delinquent and classified loans, and changes in the volume of non-accrual loans, trouble debt restructuring, and other loan modifications. \n 9) Changes in the political and regulatory environment. \nThe qualitative analysis at December 31, 2015 indicated a general reserve of $15.2 million compared with $15.7 million at December 31, 2014. Management reviews the overall economic, environmental and risk factors quarterly and determines appropriate adjustments to these sub-factors based on that review.\nThe economic factors for commercial real estate and commercial loan segments were decreased slightly in 2015 due to the continued stability of the regional and national economy. However the economic factors for residential, home equity and construction loans, which had reflected lower economic risks, were increased to reflect changes in current market conditions.\nThe environmental factors have increased in 2015, primarily in the commercial real estate, commercial and construction loan segments due to the significant growth in balances achieved amidst highly competitive conditions on pricing and terms and balances generated from the expansion into the Columbus market through a new loan production office. There was also a continued increase in the volume of loans greater than $10 million and an increase in loans to our most significant borrowers, which was considered in our evaluation of concentrations and changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio.\nThe risk factors in all loan segments were decreased in 2015. With the introduction of the new loss migration model implemented in June 2015 to determine the quantitative loss component of the general reserve, management felt that estimation risk in the allowance methodology is diminishing. In addition, during 2015, there was a significant decrease in the level of non-accrual loans, troubled debt restructurings and OREO since December 31, 2014.\nFirst Defiance's general reserve percentages for main loan segments not otherwise classified ranged from 0.53% for construction loans to 1.96% for home equity and improvement loans.\n - 40 - \nAs a result of the quantitative and qualitative analysis, along with the change in specific reserves, the Company's provision for loan losses for 2015 was $136,000 compared to $1.1 million for 2014. The allowance for loan losses was $25.4 million at December 31, 2015 and $24.8 million at December 31, 2014 and represented 1.41% and 1.50% of loans, net of undisbursed loan funds and deferred fees and costs, respectively. The decrease in specific reserves and the lower level of charge offs was offset by the increase in the quantitative reserve. The provision was offset by charge offs of $1.2 million and recoveries of $1.7 million resulting in an increase to the overall allowance for loan loss of $616,000. In management's opinion, the overall allowance for loan losses of $25.4 million as of December 31, 2015 is adequate.\nManagement also assesses the value of OREO as of the end of each accounting period and recognizes write-downs to the value of that real estate in the income statement if conditions dictate. In 2015, First Defiance recorded OREO write-downs that totaled $724,000. These amounts were included in other non-interest expense. Management believes that the values recorded at December 31, 2015 for OREO and repossessed assets represent the realizable value of such assets.\nTotal classified loans increased slightly to $49.1 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $47.3 million at December 31, 2014.\nFirst Defiance's ratio of allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 156.1% at December 31, 2015 compared with 102.6% at December 31, 2014. Management monitors collateral values of all loans included on the watch list that are collateral dependent and believes that allowances for those loans at December 31, 2015 are appropriate.\nAt December 31, 2015, First Defiance had total non-performing assets of $17.6 million, compared to $30.3 million at December 31, 2014. Non-performing assets include loans that are 90 days past due, real estate owned and other assets held for sale.\nThe decrease in non-performing assets between December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 is in commercial real estate loans, commercial loans and real estate owned. The balance of commercial real estate non-performing loans was $5.3 million lower at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014. The balance of commercial non-performing loans was $1.9 million lower at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014. The balance of OREO was $4.9 million lower at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014.\nNon-performing loans in the single-family residential, commercial real estate and commercial loan categories represent 1.27%, 1.04% and 0.73% of the total loans in those categories respectively at December 31, 2015 compared to 1.61%, 1.81% and 1.25% respectively for the same categories at December 31, 2014. Management believes that the current allowance for loan losses is appropriate and that the provision for loan losses recorded in 2015 is consistent with both charge-off experience and the risk inherent in the overall credits in the portfolio.\nFirst Federal's Asset Review Committee meets monthly to review the status of work-out strategies for all criticized relationships, which include all non-accrual loans. Based on such factors as anticipated collateral values in liquidation scenarios, cash flow projections, assessment of net worth of guarantors and all other factors which may mitigate risk of loss, the Asset Review Committee makes recommendations regarding proposed charge-offs which are approved by the Senior Loan Committee or the Loan Loss Reserve Committee.\nFor the twelve months ended and as of December 31, 2015, commercial real estate, which represented 50.71% of total loans, accounted for a net recovery of 93.33% and 60.56% of nonaccrual loans, and commercial loans, which represented 22.42% of total loans, accounted for 54.79% of net recoveries and 18.93% of nonaccrual loans. For the twelve months ended and as of December 31, 2014, commercial real estate, which represented 49.84% of total loans, accounted for a net recovery of 126.98% and 62.88% of nonaccrual loans, and commercial loans, which represented 23.70% of total loans, accounted for 195.76% of net charge-offs and 20.69% of nonaccrual loans.\n - 41 - \nTable 1 - Net Charge-offs and Non-accruals by Loan Type\n\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\t Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Statements and Factors that Could Affect Future Results\nCertain statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ( Act\u201d), notwithstanding that such statements are not specifically identified as such.

These loans accounted for approximately 8.7% and 6.7% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nHome equity and home improvement loans increased to $117.0 million at December 31, 2015, from $111.8 million at the end of 2014. At the end of 2015, those loans comprised 6.3% of the total loan portfolio, down slightly from 6.6% at December 31, 2014.\nConsumer finance and mobile home loans were $16.3 million at December 31, 2015 up from $15.5 million at the end of 2014. These loans comprised just 0.9% of the total portfolio at both December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nIn order to properly assess the collateral dependent loans included in its loan portfolio, the Company has established policies regarding the monitoring of the collateral underlying such loans. The Company requires an appraisal that is less than one year old for all new collateral dependent real estate loans, and all renewed collateral dependent real estate loans where significant new money is extended. The appraisal process is handled by the Credit Department, which selects the appraiser and orders the appraisal. First Defiance's loan policy prohibits the account officer from talking or communicating with the appraiser to insure that the appraiser is not influenced by the account officer in any way in making a determination of value.\n - 37 - \nFirst Federal generally does not require updated appraisals for performing loans unless significant new money is requested by the borrower.\nWhen a collateral dependent loan is downgraded to classified status, First Federal reviews the most current appraisal on file and if appropriate, based on First Federal's assessment of the appraisal, such as age, market, etc. First Federal will discount the appraisal amount to a more appropriate current value based on inputs from lenders and realtors. This amount may then be discounted further by First Federal's estimation of the selling costs. In most instances, if the appraisal is more than twelve to fifteen months old, a new appraisal may be required. Finally, First Federal assesses whether there is any collateral short fall, taking into consideration guarantor support and liquidity, and determines if a charge off is necessary.\nAll loans over 90 days past due and/or on non-accrual are classified as non-performing loans. Non-performing status automatically occurs in the month in which the 90-day delinquency occurs. When a collateral dependent loan moves to non-performing status, First Federal generally gets a new third party appraisal and charges the loan down appropriately based upon the new appraisal and an estimate of costs to liquidate the collateral. All properties that are moved into the Other Real Estate Owned ( OREO\u201d) category are supported by current appraisals, and the OREO is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, which is determined based on appraised value less First Federal's estimate of the liquidation costs.\nFirst Federal does not adjust any appraisals upward without written documentation of this valuation change from the appraiser. When setting reserves and charge offs on classified loans, appraisal values may be discounted downward based upon First Federal's experience with liquidating similar properties.\nAppraisals are received within approximately 60 days after they are requested. The First Federal Loan Loss Reserve Committee reviews the amount of each new appraisal and makes any necessary charge off decisions at its meeting prior to the end of each quarter.\nAny partially charged-off collateral dependent loans are considered non-performing, and as such, would need to show an extended period of time with satisfactory payment performance as well as cash flow coverage capability supported by current financial statements before First Federal will consider an upgrade to performing status. First Federal may consider moving the loan to accruing status after approximately six months of satisfactory payment performance.\nFor loans where First Federal determines that an updated appraisal is not necessary, other means are used to verify the value of the real estate, such as recent sales of similar properties on which First Federal had loans as well as calls to appraisers, brokers, realtors and investors. First Federal monitors and tracks its loan to value quarterly to determine accuracy and any necessary charge offs. Based on these results, changes may occur in the processes used.\nLoan modifications constitute a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d) if First Federal for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. For loans that are considered TDRs, First Federal either computes the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original loan's effective interest rate or it may measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral. For those loans measured for impairment utilizing the present value of future cash flows method, any discount is carried as a reserve in the allowance for loan and lease losses. For those loans measured for impairment utilizing the fair value of the collateral, any shortfall is charged off. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, First Federal had $11.2 million and $24.7 million, respectively, of loans that were still performing and which were classified as TDRs.\n - 38 - \nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of the estimated probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date. Management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses regularly through reviews of the loan portfolio. Consideration is given to economic conditions, changes in interest rates and the effect of such changes on collateral values and borrower's ability to pay, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and trends in past due and non-performing loan balances. The allowance for loan losses is a material estimate that is susceptible to significant fluctuation and is established through a provision for loan losses based on management's evaluation of the inherent risk in the loan portfolio. In addition to extensive in-house loan monitoring procedures, the Company utilizes an outside party to conduct an independent loan review of commercial loan and commercial real estate loan relationships. The goal is to have approximately 55% to 60% of the portfolio reviewed annually. This includes all relationships over $5.0 million with new exposure greater than $2.0 million and a sample of other relationships greater than $5.0 million; loan relationships between $1.0 million and $5.0 million with new exposure greater than $750,000 and a sample of other relationships between $1.0 million and $5.0 million; and a sample of relationships less than $1.0 million. Management utilizes the results of this outside loan review to assess the effectiveness of its internal loan grading system as well as to assist in the assessment of the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses associated with these types of loans.\nThe allowance for loan loss is made up of two basic components. The first component of the allowance for loan loss is the specific reserve in which the Company sets aside reserves based on the analysis of individual impaired credits. In establishing specific reserves, the Company analyzes all substandard, doubtful and loss graded loans quarterly and makes judgments about the risk of loss based on the cash flow of the borrower, the value of any collateral and the financial strength of any guarantors. If the loan is impaired and cash flow dependent, then a specific reserve is established for the discount on the net present value of expected future cash flows. If the loan is impaired and collateral dependent, then any shortfall is usually charged off. The Company also considers the impacts of any Small Business Association or Farm Service Agency guarantees. The specific reserve was $437,000 at December 31, 2015.\nThe second component is a general reserve, which is used to record loan loss reserves for groups of homogenous loans in which the Company estimates the losses incurred in the portfolio based on quantitative and qualitative factors. For purposes of the general reserve analysis, the loan portfolio is stratified into nine different loan pools based on loan type to allocate historic loss experience. The loss experience factor is then applied to the non-impaired loan portfolio. Beginning June 30, 2015, the Company refined the methodology to its allowance for loan loss calculation pertaining to the general reserve component for non-impaired loans. There was no change to the calculation of the component for reserves on impaired loans. Within the general reserve, the determination of the historical loss component was modified from using a three-year average annual loss rate to a loss migration measurement. The loss migration measurement implemented June 30, 2015, utilizes an average of four (4) four-year loss migration periods for each loan portfolio segment with differentiation between loan risk grades. This approach provides for a more precise reflection of probable incurred losses by risk grade within each loan portfolio segment over an average loan life cycle. Management believes that capturing the risk grade changes and cumulative losses over the life cycle of a loan more accurately depicts management's estimate of historical losses as well as being more reflective of the ongoing risks in the loan portfolio. Prior to June 30, 2015, the approach to this component quantified the historical loss by calculating a rolling twelve quarter average annual loss rate for each portfolio segment, without differentiation between loan risk grades. This modification resulted in a change in the general reserves between the loan portfolio segments but did not have a material impact on the overall allowance for loan losses.\n - 39 - \nThe stratification of the loan portfolio and the change to loss migration measurement described above resulted in an increase to the quantitative general allowance to $9.8 million at December 31, 2015 from $7.8 million at December 31, 2014.\nIn addition to the quantitative analysis, a qualitative analysis is performed each quarter to provide additional general reserves on the non-impaired loan portfolio for various factors. The overall qualitative factors are based on nine sub-factors. The nine sub-factors have been aggregated into three qualitative factors: economic, environment and risk.\nECONOMIC\n 1) Changes in international, national and local economic business conditions and developments, including the condition of various market segments. \n 2) Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans. \nENVIRONMENT\n 3) Changes in the nature and volume in the loan portfolio. \n 4) The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations. \n 5) Changes in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices. \n 6) Changes in the quality and breadth of the loan review process. \n 7) Changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff. \nRISK\n 8) Changes in the trends of the volume and severity of delinquent and classified loans, and changes in the volume of non-accrual loans, trouble debt restructuring, and other loan modifications. \n 9) Changes in the political and regulatory environment. \nThe qualitative analysis at December 31, 2015 indicated a general reserve of $15.2 million compared with $15.7 million at December 31, 2014. Management reviews the overall economic, environmental and risk factors quarterly and determines appropriate adjustments to these sub-factors based on that review.\nThe economic factors for commercial real estate and commercial loan segments were decreased slightly in 2015 due to the continued stability of the regional and national economy. However the economic factors for residential, home equity and construction loans, which had reflected lower economic risks, were increased to reflect changes in current market conditions.\nThe environmental factors have increased in 2015, primarily in the commercial real estate, commercial and construction loan segments due to the significant growth in balances achieved amidst highly competitive conditions on pricing and terms and balances generated from the expansion into the Columbus market through a new loan production office. There was also a continued increase in the volume of loans greater than $10 million and an increase in loans to our most significant borrowers, which was considered in our evaluation of concentrations and changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio.\nThe risk factors in all loan segments were decreased in 2015. With the introduction of the new loss migration model implemented in June 2015 to determine the quantitative loss component of the general reserve, management felt that estimation risk in the allowance methodology is diminishing. In addition, during 2015, there was a significant decrease in the level of non-accrual loans, troubled debt restructurings and OREO since December 31, 2014.\nFirst Defiance's general reserve percentages for main loan segments not otherwise classified ranged from 0.53% for construction loans to 1.96% for home equity and improvement loans.\n - 40 - \nAs a result of the quantitative and qualitative analysis, along with the change in specific reserves, the Company's provision for loan losses for 2015 was $136,000 compared to $1.1 million for 2014. The allowance for loan losses was $25.4 million at December 31, 2015 and $24.8 million at December 31, 2014 and represented 1.41% and 1.50% of loans, net of undisbursed loan funds and deferred fees and costs, respectively. The decrease in specific reserves and the lower level of charge offs was offset by the increase in the quantitative reserve. The provision was offset by charge offs of $1.2 million and recoveries of $1.7 million resulting in an increase to the overall allowance for loan loss of $616,000. In management's opinion, the overall allowance for loan losses of $25.4 million as of December 31, 2015 is adequate.\nManagement also assesses the value of OREO as of the end of each accounting period and recognizes write-downs to the value of that real estate in the income statement if conditions dictate. In 2015, First Defiance recorded OREO write-downs that totaled $724,000. These amounts were included in other non-interest expense. Management believes that the values recorded at December 31, 2015 for OREO and repossessed assets represent the realizable value of such assets.\nTotal classified loans increased slightly to $49.1 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $47.3 million at December 31, 2014.\nFirst Defiance's ratio of allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 156.1% at December 31, 2015 compared with 102.6% at December 31, 2014. Management monitors collateral values of all loans included on the watch list that are collateral dependent and believes that allowances for those loans at December 31, 2015 are appropriate.\nAt December 31, 2015, First Defiance had total non-performing assets of $17.6 million, compared to $30.3 million at December 31, 2014. Non-performing assets include loans that are 90 days past due, real estate owned and other assets held for sale.\nThe decrease in non-performing assets between December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 is in commercial real estate loans, commercial loans and real estate owned. The balance of commercial real estate non-performing loans was $5.3 million lower at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014. The balance of commercial non-performing loans was $1.9 million lower at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014. The balance of OREO was $4.9 million lower at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014.\nNon-performing loans in the single-family residential, commercial real estate and commercial loan categories represent 1.27%, 1.04% and 0.73% of the total loans in those categories respectively at December 31, 2015 compared to 1.61%, 1.81% and 1.25% respectively for the same categories at December 31, 2014. Management believes that the current allowance for loan losses is appropriate and that the provision for loan losses recorded in 2015 is consistent with both charge-off experience and the risk inherent in the overall credits in the portfolio.\nFirst Federal's Asset Review Committee meets monthly to review the status of work-out strategies for all criticized relationships, which include all non-accrual loans. Based on such factors as anticipated collateral values in liquidation scenarios, cash flow projections, assessment of net worth of guarantors and all other factors which may mitigate risk of loss, the Asset Review Committee makes recommendations regarding proposed charge-offs which are approved by the Senior Loan Committee or the Loan Loss Reserve Committee.\nFor the twelve months ended and as of December 31, 2015, commercial real estate, which represented 50.71% of total loans, accounted for a net recovery of 93.33% and 60.56% of nonaccrual loans, and commercial loans, which represented 22.42% of total loans, accounted for 54.79% of net recoveries and 18.93% of nonaccrual loans. For the twelve months ended and as of December 31, 2014, commercial real estate, which represented 49.84% of total loans, accounted for a net recovery of 126.98% and 62.88% of nonaccrual loans, and commercial loans, which represented 23.70% of total loans, accounted for 195.76% of net charge-offs and 20.69% of nonaccrual loans.\n - 41 - \nTable 1 - Net Charge-offs and Non-accruals by Loan Type\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Charge-offs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Charge-offs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Nonaccrual </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Non- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Recoveries) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Recoveries) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Accrual Loans </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In Thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In Thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.38 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,610 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.05 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Construction </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(448 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(93.33 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.56 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(263 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(54.79 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.93 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer finance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Home equity and improvement </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.74 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>689 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.24 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(480 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100.00 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,261 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Nonaccrual </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Non- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Charge-offs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Charge-offs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Accrual Loans </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In Thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In Thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>231 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.76 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,332 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.81 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Construction </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,652 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(126.98 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62.88 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>195.76 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.69 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer finance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>"}
