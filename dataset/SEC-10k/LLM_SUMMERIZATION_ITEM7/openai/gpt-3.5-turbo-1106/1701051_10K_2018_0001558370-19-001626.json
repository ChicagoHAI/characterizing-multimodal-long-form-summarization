Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is provided to assist in understanding our Company, operations and current business environment and should be considered a supplement to, and read in conjunction with, the accompanying consolidated and combined consolidated financial statements and notes included within Part II - Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, as well as the discussion of our business and related risk factors in Part I - Item 1 Business and Part I - Item 1A Risk Factors, respectively. We have restated our financial statements for 2017 and 2016 due to the correction of past errors in the accounting for deferred tax liabilities and goodwill that resulted from the 2006 Merger Transaction. Accordingly, the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth below reflect the effects of the restatements. Refer to further discussion at Part II - Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1, Ownership and Basis of Presentation\u201d.\nOverview\nWe provide high-speed data ( HSD\u201d), cable television ( Video\u201d), digital telephony ( Telephony\u201d), and business-class services to a service area that includes approximately 3.2 million homes and businesses. Our services are delivered across nineteen markets via our advanced HFC cable network. Our footprint includes the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee. Led by our robust HSD offering, our products are available either as a bundle or as an individual service to residential and business services customers. As of December 31, 2018, 808 thousand customers subscribed to our services.\nSince commencing operations in 2001, our focus has been to offer a competitive alternative cable service and establish a brand with a strong market position. We have scaled our business through (i) organic subscriber growth and increased penetration within our existing markets and footprint, (ii) edge-outs to grow our footprint, (iii) upgrades to introduce enhanced broadband services to networks we have acquired, (iv) entry into business services, with a broad range of HSD, Video and Telephony products, and (v) acquisitions and integration of cable systems.\nWe operate primarily in economically stable suburbs that are adjacent to large metropolitan areas as well as secondary and tertiary markets, which we believe have favorable competitive and demographic profiles and include businesses operating across a range of industries. We benefit from the ability to augment our footprint by pursuing value-accretive network extensions, or edge-outs, to increase our addressable market and grow our customer base. We have historically made selective capital investments in edge-outs to facilitate growth in residential and business services.\nWe are focused on efficient capital spending and maximizing adjusted earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d) through an Internet-centric growth strategy while maintaining a profitable video subscriber base. Based on our per subscriber economics, we believe that HSD represents the greatest opportunity to enhance profitability across our residential and business markets. We believe that our advanced network is designed to meet our current and future customers' HSD needs. We offer HSD speeds up to 1 GIG (1000 Mbps) in approximately 95% of our footprint.\nOur most significant competitors are other cable television operators, direct broadcast satellite providers and certain telephone companies that offer services that provide features and functionality similar to our HSD, Video and Telephony services. We believe that our strategy of operating primarily in suburban areas provides better operating and financial stability compared to the more competitive environments in large metropolitan markets. We have a history of successfully competing in chosen markets despite the presence of competing incumbent providers through attractive high value bundling of our services and investments in new service offerings.\nIn the following context, the terms we\u201d, us\u201d, WOW\u201d or the Company\u201d may refer, as the context requires, to WOW or, collectively, WOW and its subsidiaries. See further discussion in Part I. Item 1. Business\u201d.\nHurricane Michael\nOn October 10, 2018, Hurricane Michael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle, resulting in significant damage to our network infrastructure and widespread power outages and service disruptions for the majority of our customers in this service area. As a result, we issued service outage credits to impacted customers totaling $5.4 million as of December 31, 2018. In addition, we incurred $0.7 million of additional expenses primarily related to repair and maintenance costs associated with the restoration of the network and customer service, net of programming and other savings and insurance proceeds.\nFor several weeks after the storm, a portion of our workforce was dedicated to restoring services to our customers as quickly as possible. In less than 90 days, we restored approximately 430 miles of network infrastructure and as of January 4, 2019, completed our restoration of the Panama City, FL network. As of December 31, 2018, we incurred capital expenditures related to restoration of the network of approximately $26.4 million.\nSale of Chicago Fiber Network\nOn December 14, 2017, the Company sold a portion of its fiber network in the Chicago market to a subsidiary of Verizon for $225.0 million in cash. In addition, the Company and a subsidiary of Verizon entered into a construction service agreement pursuant to which we agreed to complete the build-out of the network in exchange for $50.0 million (which approximates our remaining estimate to complete the network build-out), recognized over time as the remaining network elements are completed and accepted. The final build-out of the network is expected to be completed during the first half of 2019.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn December 14, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our outstanding common stock. As of March 26, 2018, we completed the stock repurchase program with total common stock shares repurchased of 5.1 million for $50.0 million.\nOn May 10, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $25.0 million of our outstanding common stock. As of August 8, 2018, we completed the stock repurchase program with total common stock shares repurchased of 2.5 million for $25.0 million.\nInterest Rate Swap\nOn May 9, 2018, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount covering approximately 60% of the outstanding principal balance of our floating rate debt to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates.\nRedemption of 10.25% Senior Notes\nOn March 20, 2017, we utilized cash on hand to redeem $95.1 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of our previously issued 10.25% Senior Notes (the Senior Notes\u201d). In addition to the partial redemption, we paid accrued interest on the Senior Notes of $1.7 million and a call premium of $4.9 million. We recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $5.0 million, primarily representing the cash call premium paid.\nOn July 17, 2017, we used the proceeds of the new Term B loans, borrowed $180.0 million under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the IPO, and cash on hand to fully redeem all of the Company's remaining outstanding Senior Notes and to pay certain fees and expenses. In connection with the redemption of the Senior Notes, we satisfied and discharged the indenture governing the Senior Notes. We paid $729.9 million in principal amount, incurred prepayment fees of $18.7 million and paid accrued interest of $37.6 million. We recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $19.8 million related to the write-off of deferred issuance costs, premium, and prepayment fees.\nRedemption of 13.38% Senior Subordinated Notes\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we made two payments to partially redeem our previously issued 13.38% Senior Subordinated Notes. The final redemption payment was made on December 18, 2016.\nRefinancing of the Term B Loans and Revolving Credit Facility\nOn July 17, 2017, we entered into an eighth amendment ( Eighth Amendment\u201d) to our Credit Agreement, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent and revolver agent. Under the Eighth Amendment, (i) we borrowed new Term B loans in an aggregate principal amount of $230.5 million, for a total outstanding Term B loan principal amount of $2.28 billion and (ii) the revolving credit commitments were increased by an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million, for a total outstanding revolving credit commitment of $300.0 million available to us under the revolving credit facility. The new Term B loans will mature on August 19, 2023 and bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to ABR plus 2.25% or LIBOR plus 3.25%. Loans under the revolving credit facility will mature on May 31, 2022 and bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to ABR plus 2.00% or LIBOR plus 3.00%. The guarantees, collateral and covenants in the Eighth Amendment remain unchanged from those contained in the credit agreement prior to the Eighth Amendment. As a result of the refinancing, we recorded a $6.3 million loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and third party costs.\nOn May 31, 2017, we entered into a seventh amendment ( Seventh Amendment\u201d) to our Credit Agreement. The Seventh Amendment (i) refinanced the then existing $200.0 million of borrowings available to us under the revolving credit facility and (ii) extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to May 31, 2022, unless an earlier date was triggered under certain circumstances. The interest rate margins applicable to the revolving credit facility bore interest at a rate equal to ABR plus 2.00% or LIBOR plus 3.00%. Additionally, we entered into an Incremental Commitment Letter to our revolving credit facility that increased the available borrowings to $300.0 million that became available upon compliance with certain conditions (see discussion of the redemption of Senior Notes above, whereby such conditionality was subsequently achieved as a result of the Eighth Amendment). The guarantees, collateral and covenants in the Seventh Amendment remained unchanged from those contained in the credit agreement prior to the Seventh Amendment. As a result of the refinancing, we recorded a $1.0 million loss on early extinguishment of debt, primarily related to the write-off of unamortized deferred issuance costs and third party costs.\nSale of Lawrence, Kansas Systems\nOn January 12, 2017, we and Midcontinent Communications ( MidCo\u201d) entered into an agreement under which MidCo acquired our Lawrence, Kansas systems, for net proceeds of approximately $213.0 million in cash, subject to certain normal and customary purchase price adjustments set forth in the agreement. We and MidCo also entered into a Transition Services Agreement pursuant to which we provided certain services to MidCo on a transitional basis. Charges for the transition services allowed us to fully recover all allowed costs and allocated expenses incurred in connection with providing such services, generally without profit. The results of our Lawrence, Kansas system are included for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the first 12 days for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNuLink Acquisition\nOn September 9, 2016, we finalized our acquisition of HC Cable Opco, LLC d/b/a NuLink in Newnan, Georgia for $54.3 million, all of which we paid in cash. The acquisition extended our HSD, Video and Telephony service and award-winning customer support experience to more than 34 thousand additional homes and businesses. The results of our NuLink acquisition are included in our consolidated financial statements for the period September 9, 2016 through December 31, 2018.\nAvista and Crestview Investment\nOn December 18, 2015, Crestview Advisors, LLC ( Crestview\u201d) and our former Parent consummated a transaction whereby Crestview Partners III GP, L.P. became the beneficial owner of approximately 35% of the membership units of our former Parent. Under terms of the agreement, Crestview's funds purchased units held by Avista Capital Partners ( Avista\u201d) and other unit holders, and made a $125.0 million primary investment in newly-issued units.\nOn April 29, 2016, funds managed by Avista and Crestview made an additional $40.0 million investment in newly-issued membership units in our former Parent.\nAs of December 31, 2017, all the proceeds from the funds' investments of Avista and Crestview in the amount of $143.3 million, net of transaction costs, had been contributed to the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Crestview and Avista hold approximately 68% of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that are reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, which would potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because of the judgment necessary to account for these matters and the significant estimates involved, which are susceptible to change.\nValuation of Plant, Property and Equipment and Intangible Assets\nCarrying Value. The aggregate carrying value of our plant, property and equipment and intangible assets (including franchise operating rights and goodwill) comprised approximately 94% and 93% of our total assets at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nPlant, property and equipment are recorded at cost and include costs associated with the construction of cable transmission and distribution facilities and new service installations at customer locations. Capitalized costs include materials, labor and certain indirect costs attributable to the capitalization activity. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Upon sale or retirement of an asset, the cost and related depreciation are removed from the related accounts, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in operating results. We make judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be capitalized. We capitalize direct labor associated with capitalizable activities and indirect cost using standards developed from operational data, including the proportionate time to perform a new installation relative to the total technical operations activities and an evaluation of the nature of the indirect costs incurred to support capitalizable activities. Judgment is required to determine the extent to which indirect costs that have been incurred are related to capitalizable activities and, as a result, should be capitalized. Indirect costs include (i) employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct labor, (ii) direct variable cost of installation and construction vehicle costs, (iii) the direct variable costs of support personnel directly involved in assisting with installation activities, such as dispatchers and (iv) indirect costs directly attributable to capitalizable activities.\nIntangible assets consist primarily of acquired franchise operating rights, franchise-related customer relationships and goodwill. Franchise operating rights represent the value attributable to agreements with local franchising authorities, which allows access to homes in the public right of way. Our franchise operating rights were acquired through business combinations. We do not amortize cable franchise operating rights as we have determined that they have an indefinite life. Costs incurred in negotiating and renewing cable franchise agreements are expensed as incurred. Franchise-related customer relationships represent the value of the benefit to us of acquiring the existing cable subscriber base and are amortized over the estimated life of the subscriber base, generally four years, on a straight-line basis. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired in business combinations.\nWe conduct our cable operations under the authority of state cable television franchises, except in Alabama and parts of Michigan where we continue to operate under local franchises. Our franchises generally have service terms that last from five to 15 years, but we operate in some states that have perpetual terms. All of our term-limited franchise agreements are subject to renewal. The renewal process for our state franchises is specified by state law and tends to be a simple process, requiring the filing of a renewal application with information no more burdensome than that contained in our original application. Although renewal is not assured, there are provisions in the law that protect the Company from arbitrary or unreasonable denial. This is especially true for competitive cable providers like us. In most areas in which we operate, we are a competitive\u201d operator, meaning that we compete directly in the service area with at least one other franchised cable operator. The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 ( 1992 Cable Act\u201d) says that a franchising authority may not...unreasonably refuse to award an additional competitive franchise.\u201d The 1992 Cable Act also provides a formal renewal process that protects cable operators against arbitrary or unreasonable refusals to renew a franchise. In those few areas where we operate under local franchises, we can use this formal renewal process if needed.\nIn our experience, state and local franchising authorities encourage our entry into the market, as our competitive presence often leads to overall better service, more service options and lower prices. In our and our expert advisors' experience, it has not been the practice for a franchising authority to deny a cable franchise renewal. We have never had a renewal denied.\nAsset Impairments. Long-lived assets, including plant, property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the total of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset.\nFranchise Operating Rights. The net carrying value of franchise operating rights as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $809.2 million and $952.4 million, respectively. See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated and combined\nconsolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of how we value and evaluate franchise operating rights for impairment.\nThe estimates and assumptions made in our analysis are inherently subject to significant uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and there is no assurance that these results can be achieved. The primary assumptions for which there is a reasonable possibility of the occurrence of a variation that would significantly affect the measurement value include the assumptions regarding revenue growth, programming expense growth rates, the amount and timing of capital expenditures and the discount rate utilized.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our franchise operating rights at least annually on October 1, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. During the first quarter of 2018, we identified a triggering event that indicated our assets might be impaired. As a result of the interim impairment test, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $143.2 million.\nFor the annual assessment, we performed a qualitative and quantitative assessment which resulted in the fair value exceeding the carrying value for each of our reporting units. As such, no further impairment charges were recognized.\nGoodwill. The net carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $408.8 million and $481.9 million, respectively. See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated and combined consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of how we value and evaluate goodwill for impairment.\nSimilar to franchise operating rights, we evaluate the recoverability of our goodwill annually on October 1, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. During the first quarter of 2018, we identified a triggering event that indicated our assets might be impaired. As a result of the interim impairment test, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $73.1 million.\nFor the annual assessment, we performed a qualitative and quantitative assessment which resulted in the fair value exceeding the carrying value of our goodwill. As such, no further impairment charges were recognized.\nFair Value Measurements\nGAAP provides guidance for a framework for measuring fair value in the form of a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Financial assets and liabilities are classified by level in their entirety based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability due to the fact there is no market activity.\nWe record our interest rate swaps at fair value on the balance sheet and perform recurring fair value measurements with respect to these derivative financial instruments. The fair value measurements of our interest rate swaps are determined using cash flow valuation models. The inputs to the cash flow models consist of, or are derived from, observable data for substantially the full term of the swaps. This observable data includes interest and swap rates, yield curves and credit ratings, which are retrieved from available market data. The valuations are then adjusted for our own nonperformance risk as well as the counterparty as required by the provisions of the authoritative guidance. See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated and combined consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities.\nWe also have non-recurring valuations primarily associated with (i) the application of acquisition accounting and (ii) impairment assessments, both of which require that we make fair value determinations as of the applicable\nvaluation date. In making these determinations, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts, including, but not limited to, expected future cash flows, market comparables and discount rates, remaining useful lives of long-lived assets, replacement or reproduction costs of property and equipment and the amounts to be recovered in future periods from acquired NOL's and other deferred tax assets. To assist us in making these fair value determinations, we may engage third- party valuation specialists. Our estimates in this area impact, among other items, the amount of depreciation and amortization, and any impairment charges that we may report. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. A significant portion of our long-lived assets were initially recorded through the application of acquisition accounting and all of our long-lived assets are subject to periodic or event-driven impairment assessments.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nLegal and other contingencies have a high degree of uncertainty. When a loss from a contingency becomes estimable and probable, a reserve is established. The reserve reflects management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised as facts and circumstances change. A reserve is released when a matter is ultimately brought to closure or the statute of limitations lapses or facts and circumstances change. The actual costs of resolving a claim may be substantially different from the amount of reserve we recorded. In addition, in the normal course of business, we are subject to various other legal and regulatory claims and proceedings directed at or involving us, which in our opinion will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations or liquidity.\nProgramming Agreements\nWe exercise significant judgment in estimating programming expense associated with certain video programming contracts. Our policy is to record video programming costs based on our contractual agreements with our programming vendors, which are generally multi-year agreements that provide for us to make payments to the programming vendors at agreed upon market rates based on the number of customers to which we provide the programming service. If a programming contract expires prior to the parties' entry into a new agreement and we continue to distribute the service, we estimate the programming costs during the period there is no contract in place. In doing so, we consider the previous contractual rates, inflation and the status of the negotiations in determining our estimates. When the programming contract terms are finalized, an adjustment to programming expense is recorded, if necessary, to reflect the terms of the new contract. We also make estimates in the recognition of programming expense related to other items, such as the accounting for free periods, timing of rate increases and credits from service interruptions, as well as the allocation of consideration exchanged between the parties in multiple-element transactions.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the difference is expected to reverse. Additionally, the impact of changes in the tax rates and laws on deferred taxes, if any, is reflected in the financial statements in the period of enactment.\nAs a result of the Restructuring, WOW Finance became a single member LLC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Restructuring is treated as a change in tax status related to WOW Finance, since a single member LLC is required to record current and deferred income taxes reflecting the results of its operations.\nFrom time to time, we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. Examples of such transactions include business acquisitions and dispositions, including dispositions designed to be tax free, issues related to consideration paid or received, investments and certain financing transactions. Significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. We prepare and file tax returns based on interpretation of tax laws and regulations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax, interest and penalty\nassessments by these taxing authorities. In determining our income tax provision for financial reporting purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain income tax positions unless such positions are determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits. That is, for financial reporting purposes, we only recognize tax benefits taken on the tax return that we believe are more likely than not of being sustained. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether positions taken on the tax return are more likely than not of being sustained.\nWe adjust our tax reserve estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations. The consolidated income tax provision of any given year includes adjustments to prior year income tax accruals that are considered appropriate and any related estimated interest. Our policy is to recognize, when applicable, interest and penalties on uncertain income tax positions as part of income tax provision.\nPost-Restructuring Valuation Allowance Calculation\nAs a result of the Restructuring, the Company files a single federal consolidated income tax return that reflects WideOpenWest, Inc. as the consolidated group parent. The Company's deferred taxes include income tax attributes of the legacy Members which merged into the Company as part of the Restructuring. These deferred taxes also include the recalculated tax basis differences of the assets and liabilities of WOW Finance that occurred as a result of the change in tax status of WOW Finance.\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements include a reported net deferred tax liability, excluding valuation allowance, of $176.7 and $194.8 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Included in this deferred tax liability are indefinite-lived credit items totaling $184.3 million and $247.1 million, respectively. The portion of the deferred tax liability related to indefinite-lived intangibles cannot be assured and thus will not be available as a source of taxable income to utilize the deferred tax assets. The Company recorded a deferred tax valuation allowance of $24.8 million and $60.5 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nHomes Passed and Customers\nWe report homes passed as the number of serviceable addresses, such as single residence homes, apartments and condominium units, and businesses passed by our broadband network and listed in our database. We report total subscribers as the number of subscribers that receive at least one of our HSD, Video or Telephony services, without regard to which or how many services they subscribe. We define each of the individual HSD subscribers, Video subscribers and Telephony subscribers as a revenue generating unit ( RGU\u201d).

While we take appropriate steps to ensure subscriber information is presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance sheet date, we periodically review our policies in light of the variability we may encounter across our different markets due to the nature and pricing of products and services and billing systems. Accordingly, we may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber information based on such reviews.\nFinancial Statement Presentation\nRevenue\nOur operating revenue is primarily derived from monthly recurring charges for HSD, Video, Telephony and other business services to residential and business customers, in addition to other revenues.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nHSD revenue consists primarily of fixed monthly fees for data service and rental of modems.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nVideo revenue consists primarily of fixed monthly fees for basic, premium and digital cable television services and rental of video converter equipment, as well as charges from optional services, such as pay-per-view, video-on-demand and other events available to the customer. The Company is required to pay certain cable franchising authorities an amount based on the percentage of gross revenue derived from video services. The Company generally passes these fees on to the customer, which is included in video revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTelephony revenue consists primarily of fixed monthly fees for local service and enhanced services, such as call waiting, voice mail and measured and flat rate long-distance service.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther business service revenue consists primarily of monthly recurring charges for session initiated protocol, web hosting, metro Ethernet, wireless backhaul, broadband carrier and cloud infrastructure services provided to business customers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther revenue consists primarily of revenue from line assurance warranty services provided to residential and business customers and revenue from advertising placement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our HSD, Video and Telephony services provided by our cable systems were 92%, 88% and 87% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Historically, these customer subscriptions may be discontinued by the customer at any time without penalty. Beginning in March 2016, we began offering one and two year contracts that contain early termination fees upon cancellation prior to the contract terms. The remaining approximately 10% of non-subscription revenue is derived primarily from other business services, line assurance warranty services and advertising placement.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur expenses primarily consist of operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense.\nOperating expenses primarily include programming costs, data costs, transport costs and network access fees related to our HSD, Video and Telephony services, costs of dark fiber sales, network operations and maintenance services, customer service and call center expenses, bad debt, billing and collection expenses and franchise and other regulatory fees.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily include salaries and benefits of corporate and field management, sales and marketing personnel, human resources and related administrative costs.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation of our broadband networks and equipment, buildings and leasehold improvements and amortization of other intangible assets with definite lives primarily related to acquisitions. Depreciation and amortization expense is presented separately from operating and selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\nWe control our costs of operations by maintaining strict controls on expenditures. More specifically, we are focused on managing our cost structure by improving workforce productivity, increasing the effectiveness of our purchasing activities and maintaining discipline in customer acquisition. We expect programming expenses to continue to increase due to a variety of factors, including increased demands by owners of some broadcast stations for carriage of other services or payments to those broadcasters for retransmission consent and annual increases imposed by programmers with additional selling power as a result of media consolidation. We have not been able to fully pass these increases on to our customers without the loss of customers nor do we expect to be able to do so in the future.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December

Contributing to the increase was approximately $40.0 million related to adjustments for the new revenue recognition accounting guidance, partially offset by a decrease of $5.1 million related to credits to revenue associated with Hurricane Michael and $1.3 million related to the disposition of our Lawrence, Kansas system on January 12, 2017.\nAfter accounting for these non-recurring changes in revenue, the resulting decline of $10.5 million in subscription revenue is primarily due to a $41.8 million reduction in average total RGUs, partially offset by a $31.3 million increase in ARPU of our customer base, which is calculated as subscription revenue for each of the HSD, Video and Telephony services divided by the average total RGUs for each service category for the respective period.\nThe decrease in other business services revenue of $11.8 million, or 30%, is primarily due to decreased revenue generated by network construction activities and the sale of the Chicago fiber assets and associated loss of wholesale customers.\nThe decrease in other revenue of $45.6 million, or 42%, is partially due to the reclassification of franchise and installation fees to residential video subscription revenue in accordance with the new revenue recognition accounting guidance for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe following table details subscription revenue by service offering for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSubscription\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSubscription\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSubscription\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRGUs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRGUs(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHSD subscription\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n467.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n746.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n408.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n740.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n58.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nVideo subscription\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n479.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n419.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n497.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n467.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(17.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTelephony subscription\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n116.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n212.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n133.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n239.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(17.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(13)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,062.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,039.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n23.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage subscribers, presented in thousands, is calculated based on reported subscribers and is not adjusted for changes related to the disposition of our Lawrence, Kansas system.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHSD Subscription\nHSD subscription revenue increased $58.3 million, or 14%, during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in HSD subscription revenue includes an increase of $8.3 million related to the new revenue recognition guidance, partially offset by a decrease of $2.2 million related to credits to revenue associated with Hurricane Michael and $0.6 million related to the disposition of our Lawrence, Kansas system.\nAfter accounting for these non-recurring changes in revenue, the remaining $52.8 million increase in HSD subscription revenue is primarily due to a $13.4 million increase in average HSD RGUs and a $39.4 million increase in HSD ARPU.\nVideo Subscription\nVideo subscription revenue decreased $17.7 million, or 4%, during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in Video subscription revenue includes an increase of $36.3 million related to the new revenue recognition guidance, partially offset by a decrease of $2.2 million related to credits to revenue associated with Hurricane Michael and $0.6 million related to the disposition of our Lawrence, Kansas system.\nAfter accounting for these non-recurring changes in revenue, the resulting $51.2 million decrease in Video subscription revenue is primarily due to a $42.0 million decrease in average Video RGUs and a $9.2 million decrease in Video ARPU.\nTelephony Subscription\nTelephony subscription revenue decreased $17.5 million, or 13%, during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in Telephony subscription revenue includes decreases of $4.6 million related to the new revenue recognition guidance, $0.7 million related to credits to revenue associated with Hurricane Michael and $0.1 million related to the disposition of our Lawrence, Kansas system.\nAfter accounting for these non-recurring changes in revenue, the remaining $12.1 million decrease in Telephony subscription revenue is primarily due to a $13.2 million decrease in average Telephony RGUs, partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in Telephony ARPU.\nOperating Expenses (Excluding depreciation and amortization)\nOperating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased $7.5 million, or 1%, during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease is primarily attributable to increases in eligible capitalizable costs and decreases in compensation, including commissions, and benefits. The overall decrease is partially offset by increases in repair and maintenance primarily attributable to Hurricane Michael.\nIncremental contribution\nA presentation of incremental contribution, a non-GAAP measure, is included below.\nIncremental contribution is included herein because it is a key metric used by our management to assess the financial performance of the business by showing how the relative relationship of the various components of subscription services contributes to our overall consolidated historical results. Our management believes that it provides useful information to investors in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations because the additional detail illustrates how an incremental dollar of revenue, by particular service type, generates cash, before any unallocated costs are considered, which we believe is a key component of our overall strategy and important for understanding what drives our cash flow position relative to our historical results. We believe that when evaluating our business, investors apply varying degrees of importance to the different types of subscription revenue we generate and providing supplemental detail on these services, as well as third party costs associated with each service, is useful to investors because it allows investors to better evaluate these aspects of our performance. Incremental contribution is defined by WOW as the components of subscription revenue, less costs directly incurred from third parties in connection with the provision of such services to our customers.\nIncremental contribution is not made in accordance with GAAP and our use of the term incremental contribution varies from others in our industry. Incremental contribution has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP as it does not identify or allocate any other operating costs and expenses that are components of our income from operations to specific subscription revenues as we do not measure or record such costs and expenses in a manner that would allow attribution to a specific component of subscription revenue. Accordingly, incremental contribution should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or operating cash flows, or as measures of liquidity.\nThe following tables provide the most comparable GAAP measurements (i.e. Income from Operations) for the years ended December 31,

11%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is mainly due to an increase in marketing and advertising expense, restructuring activities, and third party professional fees. The overall increase is partially offset by a decrease in operating taxes.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses decreased $11.2 million, or 6%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of the Chicago fiber assets on December 14, 2017.\nImpairment Losses on Intangibles and Goodwill\nAs a result of the decline in the Company's common stock price during the three months ended March 31, 2018, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $143.2 million related to certain franchise operating rights and a $73.1 million non-cash impairment charge of goodwill in certain of our markets. The primary driver of the impairment charges was a decline in the price of our common stock, which reduced market multiples utilized to determine estimated fair market values of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill in certain reporting units. See Note 7 - Franchise Operating Rights & Goodwill for discussion of non-cash impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nGain on Sale of Assets, net\nOn December 14, 2017, we sold a portion of our Chicago fiber network to a subsidiary of Verizon for $225.0 million in cash. We recorded a gain on sale of assets of approximately $94.1 million. In addition, we and a subsidiary of Verizon entered into a construction agreement pursuant to which we agreed to complete the build-out of the network in exchange for $50.0 million (which approximates our estimate to complete the network build-out), recognized over time as the remaining network elements are completed and accepted. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a $2.0 million gain as a result of the completion and acceptance of certain elements of the construction agreement.\nPartially offsetting the $2.0 million gain related to the construction agreement is a $1.1 million net loss on the write-down of fixed assets damaged as a result of Hurricane Michael. See Note 21 - Other Matters for discussion on the impact of the storm for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nManagement Fee to Related Party Expenses\nPrior to our IPO, we paid a quarterly management fee of approximately $0.4 million per quarter plus any travel and miscellaneous expenses to Avista. In addition, pursuant to a consulting agreement dated as of December 18, 2015 by and among former Parent, Avista and Crestview, Crestview was entitled to 50% of any management fee actually received by Avista. In connection with our IPO, we no longer pay any management fee to Avista or Crestview.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $19.1 million, or 13%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease is primarily due to lower weighted average debt and a lower blended interest rate mainly related to the redemption of the 10.25% Senior Notes on July 17, 2017.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the difference is expected to reverse. Additionally, the impact of changes in the tax rates and laws on deferred taxes, if any, is reflected in the financial statements in the period of enactment.\nWe reported total income tax benefit of $61.8 million and $157.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Approximately $33.6 million of tax benefit reported for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to the change in valuation allowance. This change was the result of recording indefinite lived deferred tax assets related to a business interest expense limitation and net operating loss carryforwards. As a result of these indefinite lived deferred tax assets, we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $26.3 million as of December 31, 2018. The remaining income tax benefit is primarily due to recording a non-cash impairment charge during the first quarter of 2018 on certain franchise operating rights and goodwill, which are indefinite-lived assets. As a result of the impairment, we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $45.7 million.\nThe Tax Cut and Jobs Act made significant changes to the tax laws applicable to the Company including a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21%. Re-measuring the ending balance of the Company's deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted in a one-time $124.1 million deferred tax benefit. The year over year decrease in the total income tax benefit is primarily attributed to the one time re-measurement of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act and the net impact of non-cash impairment charges and the sale of the Company's Lawrence, Kansas system on the Company's indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had available federal net operating loss carryforwards ( NOL\u201d) of $736.6 million, of which $84.0 million are indefinite lived and $652.6 million are definite lived and expire between 2023 and 2036. The definite lived net operating loss carryforwards of $652.6 million is subject to an annual utilization limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 due to an ownership change as a result of the IPO (effective May 25, 2017). Section 382 provides limitations on the utilization of NOL carryforwards after an ownership change. We have analyzed the potential Section 382 impacts on our NOL carryforwards and determined that, although $652.6 million of this carryforward is subject to an annual Section 382 limitation, based on the fair market value of WOW at the time of the IPO and WOW's NUBIG position, the NUBIG has resulted in a significant increase in the Company's annual Section 382 limitation. The NUBIG is determined based on the difference between the fair market value of WOW's assets and WOW's tax basis as of the ownership change date. Because of the existence of the NUBIG, the annual limitation imposed by Section 382 will be significantly increased each year during the five-year period beginning on the date of the Section 382 ownership change (the recognition period\u201d). The increased annual limitation arising from the NUBIG is available on a cumulative basis during and after the recognition period following the Section 382 ownership change to offset taxable income. Accordingly, the Company expects that the Section 382 limitation relating to the $652.6 million of available net operating loss carryforwards will not result in any significant impacts on the Company's ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income nor will have significant impact on future operating cash flows. However, future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an additional ownership change under Section 382. The generation of NOLs subsequent to December 31, 2017 are subject to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which removes NOL expirations, but limits utilization against taxable income to 80%.\nThe Company also had various state net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $845.0 million, of which $64.4 million are indefinite lived and $780.6 million that expire between 2019 and 2037. Of this amount, approximately $646.4 million is subject to an annual Section 382 limitation due to an ownership change of the Company, as previously noted.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to

revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 declined $35.7 million, or 3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Of this decline, approximately $68.7 million was attributable to a decrease in the\naverage billable RGUs for the year compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 as we continue to see decreased subscriptions for Video and Telephony services among our customer base. The sale of the Lawrence, Kansas system contributed an additional $39.0 million reduction in subscription revenue. Partially offsetting the decrease was a $56.9 million increase in the ARPU of our customer base, which is calculated as subscription revenue for each of the HSD, Video and Telephony services divided by the average total RGUs for each service category for the respective period, which was driven by customer rate increases to offset the rising cost of programming per subscriber. Additionally, we had an overall increase in subscription revenue of $15.1 million attributable to our NuLink acquisition.\nOther business services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $5.7 million, or 13%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in other business services revenue is primarily due to non-recurring revenue generated by our network construction activities in 2016. Partially offsetting the decrease is an increase in our recurring revenue related to our fiber network.\nThe decrease in other revenue of $7.5 million, or 6%, is partially due to decreases in advertising revenue and other regulatory fees, which correlates with the reduction in video subscribers over the same period.\nThe following table details subscription revenue and average RGUs, by service offering for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSubscription\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSubscription\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSubscription\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRGUs(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRGUs(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHSD subscription\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n408.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n740.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n373.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n729.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n35.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nVideo subscription\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n497.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n467.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n547.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n524.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(50.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTelephony subscription\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n133.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n239.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n155.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n277.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(21.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(14)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,039.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,075.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(35.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage subscribers, presented in thousands, is calculated based on reported subscribers and is not adjusted for changes related to the disposition of our Lawrence, Kansas system and acquisition of NuLink.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHSD subscription revenue increased $35.7 million, or 10%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in HSD subscription revenue is primarily attributable to a $35.8 million increase year over year in HSD ARPU, a $9.7 million increase related to a year over year increase in average HSD RGUs and an increase of $7.3 million in HSD subscription revenue related to our NuLink acquisition. Partially offsetting the overall increase is a $17.1 million decrease related to the disposition of our Lawrence, Kansas system.\nVideo subscription revenue decreased $50.0 million, or 9%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily attributable to a year over year decrease of $58.0 million in Video RGU's and a $17.1 million decrease related to the disposition of our Lawrence, Kansas system. This overall decrease is partially offset by an increase of $19.3 million in Video ARPU and a $5.8 million increase in Video subscription revenue related to our NuLink acquisition.\nTelephony subscription revenue decreased $21.4 million, or 14% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily attributable to a $20.4 million decrease year over year in Telephony RGU's and $4.8 million decrease related to the disposition of our Lawrence, Kansas system. The overall decrease is partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in year over year Telephony ARPU and an increase of $2.1 million in Telephony subscription revenue related to our NuLink acquisition.\nOperating Expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization)\nOperating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased $41.8 million, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily due to reductions in Video programming costs and direct Telephony costs that correlate to the decreases in Video and Telephony RGUs, decreased costs related to our fiber network construction activities and overall reduced costs from our disposition of our Lawrence, Kansas system. Partially offsetting the decreases were increased repair and maintenance and non-cash employee stock compensation costs.\nIncremental contribution\nA presentation of incremental contribution, a non-GAAP measure, is included below.

</tr>\n</table>\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $22.1 million, or 19%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is mainly due to higher employee related compensation cost, an increase in telecom taxes, and third party professional fees. Partially offsetting these increases was an overall reduction in expenses related to our Lawrence, Kansas system disposition.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses decreased $8.9 million, or 4%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily due to certain intangible assets related to our acquisitions becoming fully amortized, the disposition of our Lawrence, Kansas system, and the sale of the Chicago fiber network.\nImpairment Losses on Intangibles and Goodwill\nAs a result of the annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $14.1 million related to certain franchise operating rights and a $133.3 million non-cash impairment charge of goodwill in certain of our markets. The primary driver of the impairment charges was a decline in the price of our common stock, which reduced the market multiples utilized to determine estimated fair market values of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill in certain reporting units.\nGain on Sale of Assets\nOn December 14, 2017, we sold a portion of our Chicago fiber network to a subsidiary of Verizon for $225.0 million in cash. We recorded a gain on sale of assets of approximately $94.1 million. We also entered into a construction services agreement to complete the build out of the fiber network for $50.0 million.\nManagement Fee to Related Party Expenses\nPrior to our IPO, we paid a quarterly management fee of approximately $0.4 million per quarter plus any travel and miscellaneous expenses to Avista. In addition, pursuant to a consulting agreement dated as of December 18, 2015 by and among Parent, Avista and Crestview, Crestview was entitled to 50% of any management fee actually received by Avista. Subsequent to our IPO, we no longer pay any management fee to Avista or Crestview.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $59.5 million, or 28%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily due to lower overall debt balances and a lower blended interest rate mainly related to the early extinguishment of the 13.38% Senior Subordinated Notes during the latter part of 2016 and the redemption of the Senior Notes on July 17, 2017.\nRealized and Unrealized Gain on Derivative Instruments, Net\nRealized and unrealized gain on derivative instruments was $nil and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The derivative instrument we participated in during 2016 did not qualify for hedge accounting for financial reporting purposes and as such, the adjustment to fair value of the interest rate swap was recorded to earnings at the end of each reporting period. The interest rate swap expired on July 1, 2016.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nIn connection with our Seventh Amendment and Eighth Amendment to our Credit Agreement related to the refinancing of the revolving credit facility and Term B loans, respectively, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $7.3 million primarily related to the write-off of deferred issuance costs and third party costs. Additionally, the Company fully redeemed the 10.25% Senior Notes during the year ended December 31, 2017 and recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $24.8 million related to the write-off of deferred issuance costs, premium, and prepayment fees.\nIn connection with our Sixth Amendment and Fifth Amendment to our Credit Agreement related to the refinancing of our Term B loans, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $16.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, representing the expensing of third-party arranger fees and write-off of unamortized deferred issuance costs. Additionally, on December 18, 2016, September 15, 2016 and July 15, 2016, we made principal payments on our Senior Subordinated Notes and recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt in the amount of $21.2 million, representing early prepayment penalties and write-off of deferred issuance costs.\nGain on Sale of Lawrence, Kansas System\nOn January 12, 2017, we sold our Lawrence, Kansas system to MidCo for net proceeds of approximately $213.0 million in cash, subject to certain normal and customary purchase price adjustments set forth in the Agreement. We recorded a gain on sale of assets of $38.4 million, subject to the adjustment as described above. We also entered into a transition services agreement pursuant to which we provided certain services to MidCo on a transitional basis. The transition services agreement, originally expiring on July 1, 2017, was extended to September 28, 2017. Charges for the transition services generally allowed us to fully recover all allowed costs and allocated expenses incurred in connection with providing these services, generally without profit.\nOther Income\nOther income decreased $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold our investment in Tower Cloud Inc. and recorded a gain on the sale of $2.2 million.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the difference is expected to reverse. Additionally, the impact of changes in the tax rates and laws on deferred taxes, if any, is reflected in the financial statements in the period of enactment.\nThe year over year increase in the income tax benefit is primarily attributed to the passing of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which was signed by the President on December 22, 2017. The Tax Cut and Jobs Act made significant changes to the tax laws applicable to the Company including a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21%. Re-measuring the ending balance of the Company's deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017 resulted in a $124.1 million deferred tax benefit.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had available federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $649.0 million that expire between 2023 and 2036. The net operation loss carryforward of $649.0 million is subject to an annual utilization limitation under Internal Revenue Code ( IRC\u201d) Section 382 due to an ownership change as a result of the IPO (effective May 25, 2017). Section 382 provides limitations on the utilization of NOL carryforwards after an ownership change. We have analyzed the potential Section 382 impacts on our NOL carryforwards and determined that, although $649.0 million of this carryforward is subject to an annual Section 382 limitation, based on the fair market value of WOW at the time of the IPO and WOW's NUBIG position, the NUBIG has resulted in a significant increase in the Company's annual Section 382 limitation. The NUBIG is determined based on the difference between the fair market value of WOW's assets and WOW's tax basis as of the ownership change date. Because of the existence of the NUBIG, the annual limitation imposed by Section 382 will be significantly increased each year during the five-year period beginning on the date of the Section 382 ownership change (the recognition period\u201d). The increased annual limitation arising from the NUBIG is available on a cumulative basis during and after the recognition period following the Section 382 ownership change to offset taxable income. Accordingly, the Company expects that the Section 382 limitation relating to the $649.0 million of available net operating loss carryforwards will not result in any significant impacts on the Company's ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income nor will have significant impact on future operating cash flows. However, future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an additional ownership change under Section 382. The generation of NOLs subsequent to December 31, 2017 are subject to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which removes NOL expirations, but limits utilization against taxable income to 80%.\nThe Company also had various state net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $717.6 million. Unless utilized, the state carryforwards expire from 2018 to 2036. Of this amount, approximately $674.2 million is subject to an annual limitation due to an ownership change of the Company, as previously noted.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $112.4 million in current assets, including $13.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $224.1 million in current liabilities. Our outstanding consolidated debt and capital lease obligations aggregated $2,295.5 million, of which $24.1 million is classified as current in our consolidated balance sheet.\nOn May 10, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $25.0 million of our outstanding common stock. As of August 8, 2018, we completed such stock repurchase program with total common stock shares repurchased of 2.5 million shares for $25.0 million.\nOn December 14, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our outstanding common stock. As of March 26, 2018, we completed such stock repurchase program with total common stock shares repurchased of 5.1 million shares for $50.0 million.\nOn December 14, 2017, we completed our asset purchase agreement with a subsidiary of Verizon and entered into a Construction Services Agreement pursuant to which we agreed to complete the build-out of the network in exchange for $50.0 million. The $50.0 million will be recognized over time as such network elements are completed. We have incurred expenses of approximately $38.0 million on the construction as of December 31, 2018.\nOn October 10, 2018, Hurricane Michael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle, resulting in significant damage to our network infrastructure. In less than 90 days, we restored approximately 430 miles of network infrastructure resulting in capital expenditures of approximately $26.4 million as of December 31, 2018.\nWe are required to prepay principal amounts under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities credit agreement if we generate excess cash flow, as defined in the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we had borrowing capacity of $234.5 million under our Revolving Credit Facility and were in compliance with all our debt covenants. Accordingly, we believe that we have sufficient resources to fund our obligations and anticipated liquidity requirements in the foreseeable future.\nHistorical Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $73.8 million from $195.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $269.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily due to a decrease in the cash paid for interest associated with the redemption of the 10.25% Senior Notes and Term B loan restructuring in July 2017.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $4.3 million from $191.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $195.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is primarily due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities offset by the timing of our interest payments from quarterly during the year ended December 31, 2016 to monthly during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities decreased $422.2 million from $134.5 million provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $287.7 million used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease is primarily due to the $221.6 million received associated with the Chicago fiber asset sale and $213.0 million received associated with the sale of the Lawrence, Kansas system during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities increased $455.9 million from $321.4 million cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $134.5 million cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is primarily attributable to the sale of our Lawrence, Kansas system and the sale of a portion of our Chicago fiber assets. Partially offsetting these increases was an increase in our capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2017 and the purchase of NuLink during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCapital expenditures will continue to be driven primarily by customer demand for our services. In the event we may have higher-than-expected customer demand for our services, this would result in higher revenue and income from operations, but such increased demand could also increase our projected capital expenditures.\nWe have ongoing capital expenditure requirements related to the maintenance, expansion and technological upgrades of our cable network. Capital expenditures are funded primarily through a combination of cash on hand and cash flow from operations. Our capital expenditures were $314.1 million and $301.3 million for years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The $12.8 million increase from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to the repair and replacement of our network infrastructure in the Panama City, FL market as a result of Hurricane Michael, partially offset by a decrease in investment for edge-out network expansion.\nThe following table sets forth additional information regarding our capital expenditures for the periods presented:\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital Expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCustomer premise equipment(1)\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n119.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n107.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n98.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nScalable infrastructure(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLine extensions(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n68.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n104.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n102.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUpgrade / rebuild(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSupport capital(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n66.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n49.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n48.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n314.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n301.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n287.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital expenditures included in total related to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEdge-outs(6)\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n29.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n45.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n30.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBusiness services(7)\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n48.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n70.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n76.9\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCustomer premise equipment, or CPE, includes equipment and installation costs incurred to deliver services to residential and business services customers.

The decrease is primarily due to the redemption of the 10.25% Senior Notes during the year ended December 31, 2017. The redemption of the 10.25% Senior Notes was partially offset by the receipt of cash proceeds from our initial public offering of $334.1 million and a $20.3 million capital contribution from our former Parent during the same period ended December 31, 2017.\nAdditionally, we completed $73.3 million of share repurchases associated with stock buyback programs during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities decreased $385.8 million from $94.4 million provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $291.4 million used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to the $825.0 million redemption of the Senior Notes. Partially offsetting this decrease was proceeds from our IPO during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have obligations to make future payments for goods and services under certain contractual arrangements. These contractual obligations secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of our operations. In accordance with applicable accounting rules, the future rights and obligations pertaining to firm commitments, such as operating lease obligations and certain purchase obligations under contracts, are not reflected as assets or liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The long term debt obligations are our principal payments on cash debt service obligations. Capital lease obligations are future lease payments on certain video equipment and vehicles. Operating lease obligations are the future minimum rental payments required under the operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2018.\nThe following table summarizes certain of our obligations as of December 31, 2018 and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in millions):\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayment due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2020 - 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2022 - 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong term debt obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,300.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n22.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n45.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,232.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n30.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,336.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n31.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n58.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,240.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6.5\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInterest payments associated with our variable-rate debt have not been included in the table.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is provided to assist in understanding our Company, operations and current business environment and should be considered a supplement to, and read in conjunction with, the accompanying consolidated and combined consolidated financial statements and notes included within Part II - Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, as well as the discussion of our business and related risk factors in Part I - Item 1 Business and Part I - Item 1A Risk Factors, respectively. We have restated our financial statements for 2017 and 2016 due to the correction of past errors in the accounting for deferred tax liabilities and goodwill that resulted from the 2006 Merger Transaction. Accordingly, the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth below reflect the effects of the restatements. Refer to further discussion at Part II - Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1, Ownership and Basis of Presentation\u201d.\nOverview\nWe provide high-speed data ( HSD\u201d), cable television ( Video\u201d), digital telephony ( Telephony\u201d), and business-class services to a service area that includes approximately 3.2 million homes and businesses. Our services are delivered across nineteen markets via our advanced HFC cable network. Our footprint includes the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee. Led by our robust HSD offering, our products are available either as a bundle or as an individual service to residential and business services customers. As of December 31, 2018, 808 thousand customers subscribed to our services.\nSince commencing operations in 2001, our focus has been to offer a competitive alternative cable service and establish a brand with a strong market position. We have scaled our business through (i) organic subscriber growth and increased penetration within our existing markets and footprint, (ii) edge-outs to grow our footprint, (iii) upgrades to introduce enhanced broadband services to networks we have acquired, (iv) entry into business services, with a broad range of HSD, Video and Telephony products, and (v) acquisitions and integration of cable systems.\nWe operate primarily in economically stable suburbs that are adjacent to large metropolitan areas as well as secondary and tertiary markets, which we believe have favorable competitive and demographic profiles and include businesses operating across a range of industries. We benefit from the ability to augment our footprint by pursuing value-accretive network extensions, or edge-outs, to increase our addressable market and grow our customer base. We have historically made selective capital investments in edge-outs to facilitate growth in residential and business services.\nWe are focused on efficient capital spending and maximizing adjusted earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d) through an Internet-centric growth strategy while maintaining a profitable video subscriber base. Based on our per subscriber economics, we believe that HSD represents the greatest opportunity to enhance profitability across our residential and business markets. We believe that our advanced network is designed to meet our current and future customers' HSD needs. We offer HSD speeds up to 1 GIG (1000 Mbps) in approximately 95% of our footprint.\nOur most significant competitors are other cable television operators, direct broadcast satellite providers and certain telephone companies that offer services that provide features and functionality similar to our HSD, Video and Telephony services. We believe that our strategy of operating primarily in suburban areas provides better operating and financial stability compared to the more competitive environments in large metropolitan markets. We have a history of successfully competing in chosen markets despite the presence of competing incumbent providers through attractive high value bundling of our services and investments in new service offerings.\nIn the following context, the terms we\u201d, us\u201d, WOW\u201d or the Company\u201d may refer, as the context requires, to WOW or, collectively, WOW and its subsidiaries. See further discussion in Part I. Item 1. Business\u201d.\nHurricane Michael\nOn October 10, 2018, Hurricane Michael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle, resulting in significant damage to our network infrastructure and widespread power outages and service disruptions for the majority of our customers in this service area. As a result, we issued service outage credits to impacted customers totaling $5.4 million as of December 31, 2018. In addition, we incurred $0.7 million of additional expenses primarily related to repair and maintenance costs associated with the restoration of the network and customer service, net of programming and other savings and insurance proceeds.\nFor several weeks after the storm, a portion of our workforce was dedicated to restoring services to our customers as quickly as possible. In less than 90 days, we restored approximately 430 miles of network infrastructure and as of January 4, 2019, completed our restoration of the Panama City, FL network. As of December 31, 2018, we incurred capital expenditures related to restoration of the network of approximately $26.4 million.\nSale of Chicago Fiber Network\nOn December 14, 2017, the Company sold a portion of its fiber network in the Chicago market to a subsidiary of Verizon for $225.0 million in cash. In addition, the Company and a subsidiary of Verizon entered into a construction service agreement pursuant to which we agreed to complete the build-out of the network in exchange for $50.0 million (which approximates our remaining estimate to complete the network build-out), recognized over time as the remaining network elements are completed and accepted. The final build-out of the network is expected to be completed during the first half of 2019.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn December 14, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our outstanding common stock. As of March 26, 2018, we completed the stock repurchase program with total common stock shares repurchased of 5.1 million for $50.0 million.\nOn May 10, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $25.0 million of our outstanding common stock. As of August 8, 2018, we completed the stock repurchase program with total common stock shares repurchased of 2.5 million for $25.0 million.\nInterest Rate Swap\nOn May 9, 2018, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount covering approximately 60% of the outstanding principal balance of our floating rate debt to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates.\nRedemption of 10.25% Senior Notes\nOn March 20, 2017, we utilized cash on hand to redeem $95.1 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of our previously issued 10.25% Senior Notes (the Senior Notes\u201d). In addition to the partial redemption, we paid accrued interest on the Senior Notes of $1.7 million and a call premium of $4.9 million. We recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $5.0 million, primarily representing the cash call premium paid.\nOn July 17, 2017, we used the proceeds of the new Term B loans, borrowed $180.0 million under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the IPO, and cash on hand to fully redeem all of the Company's remaining outstanding Senior Notes and to pay certain fees and expenses. In connection with the redemption of the Senior Notes, we satisfied and discharged the indenture governing the Senior Notes. We paid $729.9 million in principal amount, incurred prepayment fees of $18.7 million and paid accrued interest of $37.6 million. We recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $19.8 million related to the write-off of deferred issuance costs, premium, and prepayment fees.\nRedemption of 13.38% Senior Subordinated Notes\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we made two payments to partially redeem our previously issued 13.38% Senior Subordinated Notes. The final redemption payment was made on December 18, 2016.\nRefinancing of the Term B Loans and Revolving Credit Facility\nOn July 17, 2017, we entered into an eighth amendment ( Eighth Amendment\u201d) to our Credit Agreement, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent and revolver agent. Under the Eighth Amendment, (i) we borrowed new Term B loans in an aggregate principal amount of $230.5 million, for a total outstanding Term B loan principal amount of $2.28 billion and (ii) the revolving credit commitments were increased by an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million, for a total outstanding revolving credit commitment of $300.0 million available to us under the revolving credit facility. The new Term B loans will mature on August 19, 2023 and bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to ABR plus 2.25% or LIBOR plus 3.25%. Loans under the revolving credit facility will mature on May 31, 2022 and bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to ABR plus 2.00% or LIBOR plus 3.00%. The guarantees, collateral and covenants in the Eighth Amendment remain unchanged from those contained in the credit agreement prior to the Eighth Amendment. As a result of the refinancing, we recorded a $6.3 million loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and third party costs.\nOn May 31, 2017, we entered into a seventh amendment ( Seventh Amendment\u201d) to our Credit Agreement. The Seventh Amendment (i) refinanced the then existing $200.0 million of borrowings available to us under the revolving credit facility and (ii) extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to May 31, 2022, unless an earlier date was triggered under certain circumstances. The interest rate margins applicable to the revolving credit facility bore interest at a rate equal to ABR plus 2.00% or LIBOR plus 3.00%. Additionally, we entered into an Incremental Commitment Letter to our revolving credit facility that increased the available borrowings to $300.0 million that became available upon compliance with certain conditions (see discussion of the redemption of Senior Notes above, whereby such conditionality was subsequently achieved as a result of the Eighth Amendment). The guarantees, collateral and covenants in the Seventh Amendment remained unchanged from those contained in the credit agreement prior to the Seventh Amendment. As a result of the refinancing, we recorded a $1.0 million loss on early extinguishment of debt, primarily related to the write-off of unamortized deferred issuance costs and third party costs.\nSale of Lawrence, Kansas Systems\nOn January 12, 2017, we and Midcontinent Communications ( MidCo\u201d) entered into an agreement under which MidCo acquired our Lawrence, Kansas systems, for net proceeds of approximately $213.0 million in cash, subject to certain normal and customary purchase price adjustments set forth in the agreement. We and MidCo also entered into a Transition Services Agreement pursuant to which we provided certain services to MidCo on a transitional basis. Charges for the transition services allowed us to fully recover all allowed costs and allocated expenses incurred in connection with providing such services, generally without profit. The results of our Lawrence, Kansas system are included for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the first 12 days for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNuLink Acquisition\nOn September 9, 2016, we finalized our acquisition of HC Cable Opco, LLC d/b/a NuLink in Newnan, Georgia for $54.3 million, all of which we paid in cash. The acquisition extended our HSD, Video and Telephony service and award-winning customer support experience to more than 34 thousand additional homes and businesses. The results of our NuLink acquisition are included in our consolidated financial statements for the period September 9, 2016 through December 31, 2018.\nAvista and Crestview Investment\nOn December 18, 2015, Crestview Advisors, LLC ( Crestview\u201d) and our former Parent consummated a transaction whereby Crestview Partners III GP, L.P. became the beneficial owner of approximately 35% of the membership units of our former Parent. Under terms of the agreement, Crestview's funds purchased units held by Avista Capital Partners ( Avista\u201d) and other unit holders, and made a $125.0 million primary investment in newly-issued units.\nOn April 29, 2016, funds managed by Avista and Crestview made an additional $40.0 million investment in newly-issued membership units in our former Parent.\nAs of December 31, 2017, all the proceeds from the funds' investments of Avista and Crestview in the amount of $143.3 million, net of transaction costs, had been contributed to the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Crestview and Avista hold approximately 68% of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that are reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, which would potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because of the judgment necessary to account for these matters and the significant estimates involved, which are susceptible to change.\nValuation of Plant, Property and Equipment and Intangible Assets\nCarrying Value. The aggregate carrying value of our plant, property and equipment and intangible assets (including franchise operating rights and goodwill) comprised approximately 94% and 93% of our total assets at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nPlant, property and equipment are recorded at cost and include costs associated with the construction of cable transmission and distribution facilities and new service installations at customer locations. Capitalized costs include materials, labor and certain indirect costs attributable to the capitalization activity. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Upon sale or retirement of an asset, the cost and related depreciation are removed from the related accounts, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in operating results. We make judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be capitalized. We capitalize direct labor associated with capitalizable activities and indirect cost using standards developed from operational data, including the proportionate time to perform a new installation relative to the total technical operations activities and an evaluation of the nature of the indirect costs incurred to support capitalizable activities. Judgment is required to determine the extent to which indirect costs that have been incurred are related to capitalizable activities and, as a result, should be capitalized. Indirect costs include (i) employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct labor, (ii) direct variable cost of installation and construction vehicle costs, (iii) the direct variable costs of support personnel directly involved in assisting with installation activities, such as dispatchers and (iv) indirect costs directly attributable to capitalizable activities.\nIntangible assets consist primarily of acquired franchise operating rights, franchise-related customer relationships and goodwill. Franchise operating rights represent the value attributable to agreements with local franchising authorities, which allows access to homes in the public right of way. Our franchise operating rights were acquired through business combinations. We do not amortize cable franchise operating rights as we have determined that they have an indefinite life. Costs incurred in negotiating and renewing cable franchise agreements are expensed as incurred. Franchise-related customer relationships represent the value of the benefit to us of acquiring the existing cable subscriber base and are amortized over the estimated life of the subscriber base, generally four years, on a straight-line basis. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired in business combinations.\nWe conduct our cable operations under the authority of state cable television franchises, except in Alabama and parts of Michigan where we continue to operate under local franchises. Our franchises generally have service terms that last from five to 15 years, but we operate in some states that have perpetual terms. All of our term-limited franchise agreements are subject to renewal. The renewal process for our state franchises is specified by state law and tends to be a simple process, requiring the filing of a renewal application with information no more burdensome than that contained in our original application. Although renewal is not assured, there are provisions in the law that protect the Company from arbitrary or unreasonable denial. This is especially true for competitive cable providers like us. In most areas in which we operate, we are a competitive\u201d operator, meaning that we compete directly in the service area with at least one other franchised cable operator. The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 ( 1992 Cable Act\u201d) says that a franchising authority may not...unreasonably refuse to award an additional competitive franchise.\u201d The 1992 Cable Act also provides a formal renewal process that protects cable operators against arbitrary or unreasonable refusals to renew a franchise. In those few areas where we operate under local franchises, we can use this formal renewal process if needed.\nIn our experience, state and local franchising authorities encourage our entry into the market, as our competitive presence often leads to overall better service, more service options and lower prices. In our and our expert advisors' experience, it has not been the practice for a franchising authority to deny a cable franchise renewal. We have never had a renewal denied.\nAsset Impairments. Long-lived assets, including plant, property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the total of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset.\nFranchise Operating Rights. The net carrying value of franchise operating rights as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $809.2 million and $952.4 million, respectively. See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated and combined\nconsolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of how we value and evaluate franchise operating rights for impairment.\nThe estimates and assumptions made in our analysis are inherently subject to significant uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and there is no assurance that these results can be achieved. The primary assumptions for which there is a reasonable possibility of the occurrence of a variation that would significantly affect the measurement value include the assumptions regarding revenue growth, programming expense growth rates, the amount and timing of capital expenditures and the discount rate utilized.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our franchise operating rights at least annually on October 1, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. During the first quarter of 2018, we identified a triggering event that indicated our assets might be impaired. As a result of the interim impairment test, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $143.2 million.\nFor the annual assessment, we performed a qualitative and quantitative assessment which resulted in the fair value exceeding the carrying value for each of our reporting units. As such, no further impairment charges were recognized.\nGoodwill. The net carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $408.8 million and $481.9 million, respectively. See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated and combined consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of how we value and evaluate goodwill for impairment.\nSimilar to franchise operating rights, we evaluate the recoverability of our goodwill annually on October 1, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. During the first quarter of 2018, we identified a triggering event that indicated our assets might be impaired. As a result of the interim impairment test, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $73.1 million.\nFor the annual assessment, we performed a qualitative and quantitative assessment which resulted in the fair value exceeding the carrying value of our goodwill. As such, no further impairment charges were recognized.\nFair Value Measurements\nGAAP provides guidance for a framework for measuring fair value in the form of a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Financial assets and liabilities are classified by level in their entirety based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability due to the fact there is no market activity.\nWe record our interest rate swaps at fair value on the balance sheet and perform recurring fair value measurements with respect to these derivative financial instruments. The fair value measurements of our interest rate swaps are determined using cash flow valuation models. The inputs to the cash flow models consist of, or are derived from, observable data for substantially the full term of the swaps. This observable data includes interest and swap rates, yield curves and credit ratings, which are retrieved from available market data. The valuations are then adjusted for our own nonperformance risk as well as the counterparty as required by the provisions of the authoritative guidance. See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated and combined consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities.\nWe also have non-recurring valuations primarily associated with (i) the application of acquisition accounting and (ii) impairment assessments, both of which require that we make fair value determinations as of the applicable\nvaluation date. In making these determinations, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts, including, but not limited to, expected future cash flows, market comparables and discount rates, remaining useful lives of long-lived assets, replacement or reproduction costs of property and equipment and the amounts to be recovered in future periods from acquired NOL's and other deferred tax assets. To assist us in making these fair value determinations, we may engage third- party valuation specialists. Our estimates in this area impact, among other items, the amount of depreciation and amortization, and any impairment charges that we may report. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. A significant portion of our long-lived assets were initially recorded through the application of acquisition accounting and all of our long-lived assets are subject to periodic or event-driven impairment assessments.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nLegal and other contingencies have a high degree of uncertainty. When a loss from a contingency becomes estimable and probable, a reserve is established. The reserve reflects management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised as facts and circumstances change. A reserve is released when a matter is ultimately brought to closure or the statute of limitations lapses or facts and circumstances change. The actual costs of resolving a claim may be substantially different from the amount of reserve we recorded. In addition, in the normal course of business, we are subject to various other legal and regulatory claims and proceedings directed at or involving us, which in our opinion will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations or liquidity.\nProgramming Agreements\nWe exercise significant judgment in estimating programming expense associated with certain video programming contracts. Our policy is to record video programming costs based on our contractual agreements with our programming vendors, which are generally multi-year agreements that provide for us to make payments to the programming vendors at agreed upon market rates based on the number of customers to which we provide the programming service. If a programming contract expires prior to the parties' entry into a new agreement and we continue to distribute the service, we estimate the programming costs during the period there is no contract in place. In doing so, we consider the previous contractual rates, inflation and the status of the negotiations in determining our estimates. When the programming contract terms are finalized, an adjustment to programming expense is recorded, if necessary, to reflect the terms of the new contract. We also make estimates in the recognition of programming expense related to other items, such as the accounting for free periods, timing of rate increases and credits from service interruptions, as well as the allocation of consideration exchanged between the parties in multiple-element transactions.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the difference is expected to reverse. Additionally, the impact of changes in the tax rates and laws on deferred taxes, if any, is reflected in the financial statements in the period of enactment.\nAs a result of the Restructuring, WOW Finance became a single member LLC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Restructuring is treated as a change in tax status related to WOW Finance, since a single member LLC is required to record current and deferred income taxes reflecting the results of its operations.\nFrom time to time, we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. Examples of such transactions include business acquisitions and dispositions, including dispositions designed to be tax free, issues related to consideration paid or received, investments and certain financing transactions. Significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. We prepare and file tax returns based on interpretation of tax laws and regulations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax, interest and penalty\nassessments by these taxing authorities. In determining our income tax provision for financial reporting purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain income tax positions unless such positions are determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits. That is, for financial reporting purposes, we only recognize tax benefits taken on the tax return that we believe are more likely than not of being sustained. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether positions taken on the tax return are more likely than not of being sustained.\nWe adjust our tax reserve estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations. The consolidated income tax provision of any given year includes adjustments to prior year income tax accruals that are considered appropriate and any related estimated interest. Our policy is to recognize, when applicable, interest and penalties on uncertain income tax positions as part of income tax provision.\nPost-Restructuring Valuation Allowance Calculation\nAs a result of the Restructuring, the Company files a single federal consolidated income tax return that reflects WideOpenWest, Inc. as the consolidated group parent. The Company's deferred taxes include income tax attributes of the legacy Members which merged into the Company as part of the Restructuring. These deferred taxes also include the recalculated tax basis differences of the assets and liabilities of WOW Finance that occurred as a result of the change in tax status of WOW Finance.\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements include a reported net deferred tax liability, excluding valuation allowance, of $176.7 and $194.8 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Included in this deferred tax liability are indefinite-lived credit items totaling $184.3 million and $247.1 million, respectively. The portion of the deferred tax liability related to indefinite-lived intangibles cannot be assured and thus will not be available as a source of taxable income to utilize the deferred tax assets. The Company recorded a deferred tax valuation allowance of $24.8 million and $60.5 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nHomes Passed and Customers\nWe report homes passed as the number of serviceable addresses, such as single residence homes, apartments and condominium units, and businesses passed by our broadband network and listed in our database. We report total subscribers as the number of subscribers that receive at least one of our HSD, Video or Telephony services, without regard to which or how many services they subscribe. We define each of the individual HSD subscribers, Video subscribers and Telephony subscribers as a revenue generating unit ( RGU\u201d). The following table summarizes homes passed, total subscribers and total RGUs for our services as of each respective date and does not make adjustment for any of the Company's acquisitions or divestitures:\n\n (1) Statistical reporting was standardized to a single reporting methodology beginning in the first quarter of 2018. Previously, the data was maintained and accumulated separately through independent processes and procedures. The", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is provided to assist in understanding our Company, operations and current business environment and should be considered a supplement to, and read in conjunction with, the accompanying consolidated and combined consolidated financial statements and notes included within Part II - Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, as well as the discussion of our business and related risk factors in Part I - Item 1 Business and Part I - Item 1A Risk Factors, respectively. We have restated our financial statements for 2017 and 2016 due to the correction of past errors in the accounting for deferred tax liabilities and goodwill that resulted from the 2006 Merger Transaction. Accordingly, the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth below reflect the effects of the restatements. Refer to further discussion at Part II - Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1, Ownership and Basis of Presentation\u201d.\nOverview\nWe provide high-speed data ( HSD\u201d), cable television ( Video\u201d), digital telephony ( Telephony\u201d), and business-class services to a service area that includes approximately 3.2 million homes and businesses. Our services are delivered across nineteen markets via our advanced HFC cable network. Our footprint includes the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee. Led by our robust HSD offering, our products are available either as a bundle or as an individual service to residential and business services customers. As of December 31, 2018, 808 thousand customers subscribed to our services.\nSince commencing operations in 2001, our focus has been to offer a competitive alternative cable service and establish a brand with a strong market position. We have scaled our business through (i) organic subscriber growth and increased penetration within our existing markets and footprint, (ii) edge-outs to grow our footprint, (iii) upgrades to introduce enhanced broadband services to networks we have acquired, (iv) entry into business services, with a broad range of HSD, Video and Telephony products, and (v) acquisitions and integration of cable systems.\nWe operate primarily in economically stable suburbs that are adjacent to large metropolitan areas as well as secondary and tertiary markets, which we believe have favorable competitive and demographic profiles and include businesses operating across a range of industries. We benefit from the ability to augment our footprint by pursuing value-accretive network extensions, or edge-outs, to increase our addressable market and grow our customer base. We have historically made selective capital investments in edge-outs to facilitate growth in residential and business services.\nWe are focused on efficient capital spending and maximizing adjusted earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d) through an Internet-centric growth strategy while maintaining a profitable video subscriber base. Based on our per subscriber economics, we believe that HSD represents the greatest opportunity to enhance profitability across our residential and business markets. We believe that our advanced network is designed to meet our current and future customers' HSD needs. We offer HSD speeds up to 1 GIG (1000 Mbps) in approximately 95% of our footprint.\nOur most significant competitors are other cable television operators, direct broadcast satellite providers and certain telephone companies that offer services that provide features and functionality similar to our HSD, Video and Telephony services. We believe that our strategy of operating primarily in suburban areas provides better operating and financial stability compared to the more competitive environments in large metropolitan markets. We have a history of successfully competing in chosen markets despite the presence of competing incumbent providers through attractive high value bundling of our services and investments in new service offerings.\nIn the following context, the terms we\u201d, us\u201d, WOW\u201d or the Company\u201d may refer, as the context requires, to WOW or, collectively, WOW and its subsidiaries. See further discussion in Part I. Item 1. Business\u201d.\nHurricane Michael\nOn October 10, 2018, Hurricane Michael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle, resulting in significant damage to our network infrastructure and widespread power outages and service disruptions for the majority of our customers in this service area. As a result, we issued service outage credits to impacted customers totaling $5.4 million as of December 31, 2018. In addition, we incurred $0.7 million of additional expenses primarily related to repair and maintenance costs associated with the restoration of the network and customer service, net of programming and other savings and insurance proceeds.\nFor several weeks after the storm, a portion of our workforce was dedicated to restoring services to our customers as quickly as possible. In less than 90 days, we restored approximately 430 miles of network infrastructure and as of January 4, 2019, completed our restoration of the Panama City, FL network. As of December 31, 2018, we incurred capital expenditures related to restoration of the network of approximately $26.4 million.\nSale of Chicago Fiber Network\nOn December 14, 2017, the Company sold a portion of its fiber network in the Chicago market to a subsidiary of Verizon for $225.0 million in cash. In addition, the Company and a subsidiary of Verizon entered into a construction service agreement pursuant to which we agreed to complete the build-out of the network in exchange for $50.0 million (which approximates our remaining estimate to complete the network build-out), recognized over time as the remaining network elements are completed and accepted. The final build-out of the network is expected to be completed during the first half of 2019.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn December 14, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our outstanding common stock. As of March 26, 2018, we completed the stock repurchase program with total common stock shares repurchased of 5.1 million for $50.0 million.\nOn May 10, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $25.0 million of our outstanding common stock. As of August 8, 2018, we completed the stock repurchase program with total common stock shares repurchased of 2.5 million for $25.0 million.\nInterest Rate Swap\nOn May 9, 2018, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount covering approximately 60% of the outstanding principal balance of our floating rate debt to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates.\nRedemption of 10.25% Senior Notes\nOn March 20, 2017, we utilized cash on hand to redeem $95.1 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of our previously issued 10.25% Senior Notes (the Senior Notes\u201d). In addition to the partial redemption, we paid accrued interest on the Senior Notes of $1.7 million and a call premium of $4.9 million. We recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $5.0 million, primarily representing the cash call premium paid.\nOn July 17, 2017, we used the proceeds of the new Term B loans, borrowed $180.0 million under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the IPO, and cash on hand to fully redeem all of the Company's remaining outstanding Senior Notes and to pay certain fees and expenses. In connection with the redemption of the Senior Notes, we satisfied and discharged the indenture governing the Senior Notes. We paid $729.9 million in principal amount, incurred prepayment fees of $18.7 million and paid accrued interest of $37.6 million. We recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $19.8 million related to the write-off of deferred issuance costs, premium, and prepayment fees.\nRedemption of 13.38% Senior Subordinated Notes\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we made two payments to partially redeem our previously issued 13.38% Senior Subordinated Notes. The final redemption payment was made on December 18, 2016.\nRefinancing of the Term B Loans and Revolving Credit Facility\nOn July 17, 2017, we entered into an eighth amendment ( Eighth Amendment\u201d) to our Credit Agreement, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent and revolver agent. Under the Eighth Amendment, (i) we borrowed new Term B loans in an aggregate principal amount of $230.5 million, for a total outstanding Term B loan principal amount of $2.28 billion and (ii) the revolving credit commitments were increased by an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million, for a total outstanding revolving credit commitment of $300.0 million available to us under the revolving credit facility. The new Term B loans will mature on August 19, 2023 and bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to ABR plus 2.25% or LIBOR plus 3.25%. Loans under the revolving credit facility will mature on May 31, 2022 and bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to ABR plus 2.00% or LIBOR plus 3.00%. The guarantees, collateral and covenants in the Eighth Amendment remain unchanged from those contained in the credit agreement prior to the Eighth Amendment. As a result of the refinancing, we recorded a $6.3 million loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and third party costs.\nOn May 31, 2017, we entered into a seventh amendment ( Seventh Amendment\u201d) to our Credit Agreement. The Seventh Amendment (i) refinanced the then existing $200.0 million of borrowings available to us under the revolving credit facility and (ii) extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to May 31, 2022, unless an earlier date was triggered under certain circumstances. The interest rate margins applicable to the revolving credit facility bore interest at a rate equal to ABR plus 2.00% or LIBOR plus 3.00%. Additionally, we entered into an Incremental Commitment Letter to our revolving credit facility that increased the available borrowings to $300.0 million that became available upon compliance with certain conditions (see discussion of the redemption of Senior Notes above, whereby such conditionality was subsequently achieved as a result of the Eighth Amendment). The guarantees, collateral and covenants in the Seventh Amendment remained unchanged from those contained in the credit agreement prior to the Seventh Amendment. As a result of the refinancing, we recorded a $1.0 million loss on early extinguishment of debt, primarily related to the write-off of unamortized deferred issuance costs and third party costs.\nSale of Lawrence, Kansas Systems\nOn January 12, 2017, we and Midcontinent Communications ( MidCo\u201d) entered into an agreement under which MidCo acquired our Lawrence, Kansas systems, for net proceeds of approximately $213.0 million in cash, subject to certain normal and customary purchase price adjustments set forth in the agreement. We and MidCo also entered into a Transition Services Agreement pursuant to which we provided certain services to MidCo on a transitional basis. Charges for the transition services allowed us to fully recover all allowed costs and allocated expenses incurred in connection with providing such services, generally without profit. The results of our Lawrence, Kansas system are included for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the first 12 days for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNuLink Acquisition\nOn September 9, 2016, we finalized our acquisition of HC Cable Opco, LLC d/b/a NuLink in Newnan, Georgia for $54.3 million, all of which we paid in cash. The acquisition extended our HSD, Video and Telephony service and award-winning customer support experience to more than 34 thousand additional homes and businesses. The results of our NuLink acquisition are included in our consolidated financial statements for the period September 9, 2016 through December 31, 2018.\nAvista and Crestview Investment\nOn December 18, 2015, Crestview Advisors, LLC ( Crestview\u201d) and our former Parent consummated a transaction whereby Crestview Partners III GP, L.P. became the beneficial owner of approximately 35% of the membership units of our former Parent. Under terms of the agreement, Crestview's funds purchased units held by Avista Capital Partners ( Avista\u201d) and other unit holders, and made a $125.0 million primary investment in newly-issued units.\nOn April 29, 2016, funds managed by Avista and Crestview made an additional $40.0 million investment in newly-issued membership units in our former Parent.\nAs of December 31, 2017, all the proceeds from the funds' investments of Avista and Crestview in the amount of $143.3 million, net of transaction costs, had been contributed to the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Crestview and Avista hold approximately 68% of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that are reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, which would potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because of the judgment necessary to account for these matters and the significant estimates involved, which are susceptible to change.\nValuation of Plant, Property and Equipment and Intangible Assets\nCarrying Value. The aggregate carrying value of our plant, property and equipment and intangible assets (including franchise operating rights and goodwill) comprised approximately 94% and 93% of our total assets at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nPlant, property and equipment are recorded at cost and include costs associated with the construction of cable transmission and distribution facilities and new service installations at customer locations. Capitalized costs include materials, labor and certain indirect costs attributable to the capitalization activity. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Upon sale or retirement of an asset, the cost and related depreciation are removed from the related accounts, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in operating results. We make judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be capitalized. We capitalize direct labor associated with capitalizable activities and indirect cost using standards developed from operational data, including the proportionate time to perform a new installation relative to the total technical operations activities and an evaluation of the nature of the indirect costs incurred to support capitalizable activities. Judgment is required to determine the extent to which indirect costs that have been incurred are related to capitalizable activities and, as a result, should be capitalized. Indirect costs include (i) employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct labor, (ii) direct variable cost of installation and construction vehicle costs, (iii) the direct variable costs of support personnel directly involved in assisting with installation activities, such as dispatchers and (iv) indirect costs directly attributable to capitalizable activities.\nIntangible assets consist primarily of acquired franchise operating rights, franchise-related customer relationships and goodwill. Franchise operating rights represent the value attributable to agreements with local franchising authorities, which allows access to homes in the public right of way. Our franchise operating rights were acquired through business combinations. We do not amortize cable franchise operating rights as we have determined that they have an indefinite life. Costs incurred in negotiating and renewing cable franchise agreements are expensed as incurred. Franchise-related customer relationships represent the value of the benefit to us of acquiring the existing cable subscriber base and are amortized over the estimated life of the subscriber base, generally four years, on a straight-line basis. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired in business combinations.\nWe conduct our cable operations under the authority of state cable television franchises, except in Alabama and parts of Michigan where we continue to operate under local franchises. Our franchises generally have service terms that last from five to 15 years, but we operate in some states that have perpetual terms. All of our term-limited franchise agreements are subject to renewal. The renewal process for our state franchises is specified by state law and tends to be a simple process, requiring the filing of a renewal application with information no more burdensome than that contained in our original application. Although renewal is not assured, there are provisions in the law that protect the Company from arbitrary or unreasonable denial. This is especially true for competitive cable providers like us. In most areas in which we operate, we are a competitive\u201d operator, meaning that we compete directly in the service area with at least one other franchised cable operator. The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 ( 1992 Cable Act\u201d) says that a franchising authority may not...unreasonably refuse to award an additional competitive franchise.\u201d The 1992 Cable Act also provides a formal renewal process that protects cable operators against arbitrary or unreasonable refusals to renew a franchise. In those few areas where we operate under local franchises, we can use this formal renewal process if needed.\nIn our experience, state and local franchising authorities encourage our entry into the market, as our competitive presence often leads to overall better service, more service options and lower prices. In our and our expert advisors' experience, it has not been the practice for a franchising authority to deny a cable franchise renewal. We have never had a renewal denied.\nAsset Impairments. Long-lived assets, including plant, property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the total of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset.\nFranchise Operating Rights. The net carrying value of franchise operating rights as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $809.2 million and $952.4 million, respectively. See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated and combined\nconsolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of how we value and evaluate franchise operating rights for impairment.\nThe estimates and assumptions made in our analysis are inherently subject to significant uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and there is no assurance that these results can be achieved. The primary assumptions for which there is a reasonable possibility of the occurrence of a variation that would significantly affect the measurement value include the assumptions regarding revenue growth, programming expense growth rates, the amount and timing of capital expenditures and the discount rate utilized.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our franchise operating rights at least annually on October 1, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. During the first quarter of 2018, we identified a triggering event that indicated our assets might be impaired. As a result of the interim impairment test, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $143.2 million.\nFor the annual assessment, we performed a qualitative and quantitative assessment which resulted in the fair value exceeding the carrying value for each of our reporting units. As such, no further impairment charges were recognized.\nGoodwill. The net carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $408.8 million and $481.9 million, respectively. See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated and combined consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of how we value and evaluate goodwill for impairment.\nSimilar to franchise operating rights, we evaluate the recoverability of our goodwill annually on October 1, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. During the first quarter of 2018, we identified a triggering event that indicated our assets might be impaired. As a result of the interim impairment test, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $73.1 million.\nFor the annual assessment, we performed a qualitative and quantitative assessment which resulted in the fair value exceeding the carrying value of our goodwill. As such, no further impairment charges were recognized.\nFair Value Measurements\nGAAP provides guidance for a framework for measuring fair value in the form of a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Financial assets and liabilities are classified by level in their entirety based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability due to the fact there is no market activity.\nWe record our interest rate swaps at fair value on the balance sheet and perform recurring fair value measurements with respect to these derivative financial instruments. The fair value measurements of our interest rate swaps are determined using cash flow valuation models. The inputs to the cash flow models consist of, or are derived from, observable data for substantially the full term of the swaps. This observable data includes interest and swap rates, yield curves and credit ratings, which are retrieved from available market data. The valuations are then adjusted for our own nonperformance risk as well as the counterparty as required by the provisions of the authoritative guidance. See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated and combined consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities.\nWe also have non-recurring valuations primarily associated with (i) the application of acquisition accounting and (ii) impairment assessments, both of which require that we make fair value determinations as of the applicable\nvaluation date. In making these determinations, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts, including, but not limited to, expected future cash flows, market comparables and discount rates, remaining useful lives of long-lived assets, replacement or reproduction costs of property and equipment and the amounts to be recovered in future periods from acquired NOL's and other deferred tax assets. To assist us in making these fair value determinations, we may engage third- party valuation specialists. Our estimates in this area impact, among other items, the amount of depreciation and amortization, and any impairment charges that we may report. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. A significant portion of our long-lived assets were initially recorded through the application of acquisition accounting and all of our long-lived assets are subject to periodic or event-driven impairment assessments.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nLegal and other contingencies have a high degree of uncertainty. When a loss from a contingency becomes estimable and probable, a reserve is established. The reserve reflects management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised as facts and circumstances change. A reserve is released when a matter is ultimately brought to closure or the statute of limitations lapses or facts and circumstances change. The actual costs of resolving a claim may be substantially different from the amount of reserve we recorded. In addition, in the normal course of business, we are subject to various other legal and regulatory claims and proceedings directed at or involving us, which in our opinion will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations or liquidity.\nProgramming Agreements\nWe exercise significant judgment in estimating programming expense associated with certain video programming contracts. Our policy is to record video programming costs based on our contractual agreements with our programming vendors, which are generally multi-year agreements that provide for us to make payments to the programming vendors at agreed upon market rates based on the number of customers to which we provide the programming service. If a programming contract expires prior to the parties' entry into a new agreement and we continue to distribute the service, we estimate the programming costs during the period there is no contract in place. In doing so, we consider the previous contractual rates, inflation and the status of the negotiations in determining our estimates. When the programming contract terms are finalized, an adjustment to programming expense is recorded, if necessary, to reflect the terms of the new contract. We also make estimates in the recognition of programming expense related to other items, such as the accounting for free periods, timing of rate increases and credits from service interruptions, as well as the allocation of consideration exchanged between the parties in multiple-element transactions.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the difference is expected to reverse. Additionally, the impact of changes in the tax rates and laws on deferred taxes, if any, is reflected in the financial statements in the period of enactment.\nAs a result of the Restructuring, WOW Finance became a single member LLC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Restructuring is treated as a change in tax status related to WOW Finance, since a single member LLC is required to record current and deferred income taxes reflecting the results of its operations.\nFrom time to time, we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. Examples of such transactions include business acquisitions and dispositions, including dispositions designed to be tax free, issues related to consideration paid or received, investments and certain financing transactions. Significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. We prepare and file tax returns based on interpretation of tax laws and regulations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax, interest and penalty\nassessments by these taxing authorities. In determining our income tax provision for financial reporting purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain income tax positions unless such positions are determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits. That is, for financial reporting purposes, we only recognize tax benefits taken on the tax return that we believe are more likely than not of being sustained. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether positions taken on the tax return are more likely than not of being sustained.\nWe adjust our tax reserve estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations. The consolidated income tax provision of any given year includes adjustments to prior year income tax accruals that are considered appropriate and any related estimated interest. Our policy is to recognize, when applicable, interest and penalties on uncertain income tax positions as part of income tax provision.\nPost-Restructuring Valuation Allowance Calculation\nAs a result of the Restructuring, the Company files a single federal consolidated income tax return that reflects WideOpenWest, Inc. as the consolidated group parent. The Company's deferred taxes include income tax attributes of the legacy Members which merged into the Company as part of the Restructuring. These deferred taxes also include the recalculated tax basis differences of the assets and liabilities of WOW Finance that occurred as a result of the change in tax status of WOW Finance.\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements include a reported net deferred tax liability, excluding valuation allowance, of $176.7 and $194.8 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Included in this deferred tax liability are indefinite-lived credit items totaling $184.3 million and $247.1 million, respectively. The portion of the deferred tax liability related to indefinite-lived intangibles cannot be assured and thus will not be available as a source of taxable income to utilize the deferred tax assets. The Company recorded a deferred tax valuation allowance of $24.8 million and $60.5 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nHomes Passed and Customers\nWe report homes passed as the number of serviceable addresses, such as single residence homes, apartments and condominium units, and businesses passed by our broadband network and listed in our database. We report total subscribers as the number of subscribers that receive at least one of our HSD, Video or Telephony services, without regard to which or how many services they subscribe. We define each of the individual HSD subscribers, Video subscribers and Telephony subscribers as a revenue generating unit ( RGU\u201d). The following table summarizes homes passed, total subscribers and total RGUs for our services as of each respective date and does not make adjustment for any of the Company's acquisitions or divestitures:\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease/\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDec 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSep. 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDec. 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMar. 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nJun. 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSep. 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDec. 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nvs.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2017(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDec 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHomes passed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,097,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,109,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,129,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,149,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,160,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,176,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n67,300\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal subscribers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n776,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n777,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n798,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n800,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n805,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n807,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n30,600\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHSD RGUs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n730,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n732,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n743,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n747,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n755,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n759,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,900\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nVideo RGUs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n442,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n432,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n429,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n419,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n412,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n406,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(26,500)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTelephony RGUs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n226,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n219,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n218,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n214,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n209,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n204,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(15,500)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal RGUs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,398,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,385,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,391,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,381,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,377,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,370,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(15,100)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Statistical reporting was standardized to a single reporting methodology beginning in the first quarter of 2018.
