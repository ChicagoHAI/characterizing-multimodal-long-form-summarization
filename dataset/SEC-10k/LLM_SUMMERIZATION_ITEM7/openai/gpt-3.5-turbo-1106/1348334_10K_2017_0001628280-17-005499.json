Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The last day of our fiscal year is February 28/29. Our fiscal quarters end on May 31, August 31, November 30 and February 28/29. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth above in the section titled \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nBarracuda designs and delivers powerful yet easy-to-use security and data protection solutions. We offer cloud-enabled solutions that empower customers to address security threats, improve network performance and protect and store their data. Our security platform helps customers simplify their IT operations and address their most pressing security needs even as they adopt new deployment models and move applications, data and workloads to the cloud. Our business model is built on the core values of speed and agility, which we apply to all aspects of our approach, including our technology innovations, the delivery and deployment of our solutions and responses to customer inquiries.\nWe derive revenue from sales of appliances and subscriptions. Revenue from the sale of our appliances includes hardware and a perpetual license. Subscription revenue is generated primarily from our subscription services such as our Barracuda Energize Updates and our cloud solutions. Subscription revenue also includes revenue from fixed term licenses of our managed service provider solutions, virtual appliance software, support and maintenance. Our subscriptions include monthly and annual terms ranging from one to five years, the substantial majority of which are for one-year periods. Subscriptions are billed in advance of the purchased subscription period. Renewal rates from subscriptions, on a dollars basis, have been 92%, 93% and 94% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Subscription annual recurring revenue, which is the annualized dollar amount of recurring subscription revenue in the final month of the fiscal year, increased to $286.3 million for fiscal 2017 from $255.0 million for fiscal 2016.\nThe growth of our business and our future success depend on many factors, including our ability to continue to expand our customer base, pursue cross-sale opportunities and grow revenues from our existing customer base, expand our distribution channels, particularly internationally, continue to develop new solutions to promptly respond to our customers' needs and successfully integrate acquisitions into our business. In aligning our investments, product portfolio and routes to market to address our customers' growing adoption of public cloud, SaaS and managed service IT deployment models, we provide a security platform that spans email, management, network and application security as well as data protection, all of which can be deployed and centrally managed across diverse and distributed architectures. As our existing customers' IT buying needs evolve, or as our customers realize the benefits of the solutions that they previously purchased, our platform provides us an opportunity to cross-sell additional solutions. To support our cross-sell efforts, we intend to continue adding higher touch sales and marketing field resources to liaise with our channel partners as we continue to grow our sales both domestically and internationally. We expect that our continued investment in resources to expand our cross-sell efforts to existing customers will result in longer-term revenue growth opportunities.\nIn addition to our cross-sell efforts, our sales and marketing initiatives are primarily focused on higher-growth segments within the security and data protection markets. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to timely identify these higher-growth segments and expand our sales within them. While these areas represent significant opportunities for us, they also pose risks and challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results.\nFurthermore, our business depends on the overall demand for security and data protection solutions. Weak global economic conditions, particularly market and financial uncertainty and instability in the United States and Europe, or a reduction in security and data protection solution spending even if general economic conditions are unaffected, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results in a number of ways. Additionally, we face significant competition across all of our market segments, and must continue to execute across all functions and add qualified personnel to succeed.\nOur Business Model\nWe generally invoice at the time of sale for the total price of the solutions we deliver, and we typically collect cash in 30 to 60 days. We refer to the total amount of invoices we issue in a period as gross billings. All of the gross billings we record are recognized as revenue ratably under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), once all revenue recognition\ncriteria have been met. Gross billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue, less reserves. The hardware appliance component of our gross billings is recognized ratably as revenue over the estimated customer relationship period, which is typically three years, commencing upon the activation of the unit by the end customer. The subscription component of our gross billings is recognized ratably as revenue over the contractual period of the subscription. Because we typically bill in advance for the entire term, substantially all of our new and renewal gross billings increase our deferred revenue balance, which contributes significantly to our cash flow.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from the sales of our appliances and subscriptions.\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Appliance Revenue. Revenue from the sale of our appliances includes hardware and a perpetual software license. We recognize hardware appliance revenue over the estimated customer relationship period of three years, commencing with the end-user's activation of the appliance and related subscription, provided all other criteria for the recognition of appliance revenue are met.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Subscription Revenue. Subscription revenue is generated primarily from our subscription services such as our Barracuda Energize Updates. Subscription revenue also includes revenue from fixed term licenses of our virtual appliance software, support and maintenance. Our subscription terms include monthly and annual terms ranging from one year to five years, the substantial majority of which are for one year periods. We recognize revenue from subscriptions, support and maintenance over the contractual service period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Cost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of costs related to our appliance and subscription revenue. Such costs include hardware, manufacturing, shipping and logistics, customer support, royalty, warranty, personnel costs, service delivery and data center costs and amortization of intangible assets related to acquired technology. We expect our cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars, although it may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period, as we continue to grow.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of total revenue, or gross margin, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including manufacturing costs, cost of technical support and the mix of our solutions sold. We expect our gross profit to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and travel-related expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs for facilities, IT and depreciation. We expect operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars, although they may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period, as we continue to grow. In particular, we expect our stock-based compensation expense to increase in absolute dollars as a result of our existing stock-based compensation expense to be recognized as options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") vest and as we issue additional stock-based awards to attract and retain employees.\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for employees and executives on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease-of-use of our appliance and subscription services, as well as the development of new products. We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future solutions, although our research and development expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Sales and marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising, as well as salaries, commissions, benefits and stock-based compensation for our employees and executives engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development and customer service functions. Our advertising expenses include the costs of cooperative marketing programs developed with our channel partners and other marketing programs such as online lead generation, promotional events and web seminars. We market and sell our subscription services worldwide\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nthrough our sales organization and distribution channels, such as strategic resellers and distributors. We capitalize and amortize the direct and incremental portion of our sales commissions over the period the related revenue is recognized. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to introduce marketing campaigns and invest in sales resources in key focus areas, although our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>General and administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our finance, legal, regulatory and compliance, human resources and other administrative employees and executives. In addition, general and administrative expenses include outside consulting, legal and accounting services and facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars due to professional services fees primarily related to outside legal, audit, investor relations and consulting services to support the business, although our general and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Other Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses, interest expense on our outstanding debt and interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as well as realized gains and losses from our marketable securities portfolio. We expect interest income will vary each reporting period depending on our average investment balances during the period, types and mix of investments and market interest rates.\nBenefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes\nOur benefit from (provision for) income taxes consists primarily of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves determining income tax expense together with calculating the deferred income tax expense related to temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, along with net operating loss and credits carryforwards, if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize our consolidated results of operations for the periods presented (dollars in thousands) and as a percentage of our total revenue for

The increase in active subscribers was primarily driven by our high level of customer retention and an increase in the number of customers purchasing subscriptions from us. Total appliance revenue decreased by $6.5 million, or 7%, primarily due to the continuing shift by our customers from traditional and solely on-premises deployments to include the cloud, which includes hybrid network architectures, public and/or private clouds, SaaS applications and managed service solutions.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended February 28/29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross\nMargin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross\nMargin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>268,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue increased for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 commensurate with the increase in total revenue for the comparable periods.

As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing expenses decreased year over year primarily due to the timing and nature of marketing campaigns.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $5.3 million, or 11%, in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to decreases of $4.2 million in legal and settlement costs, which included a $2.3 million settlement charge for intellectual property matters and a $1.5 million settlement of an export compliance matter in fiscal 2016, $1.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, $0.5 million in travel and other related costs, $0.4 million in consulting costs and $0.3 million in equipment and software expense, partially offset by increases of $0.5 million in bad debt expense, $0.5 million in compensation and personnel related costs, $0.4 million in depreciation expense and $0.1 million in payment processing costs. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased year over year due to the legal and settlement costs associated with the matters noted above not recurring in fiscal 2017.\nOther Expense, Net\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nFebruary 28/29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(70\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(262\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe change in other expense, net was due primarily to an increase of $1.1 million in realized gains from the sale of marketable securities, partially offset by an increase of $0.8 million in net foreign exchange losses during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.\nBenefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nFebruary 28/29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit from (provision for) income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,753\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,480\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recorded an income tax provision of $11.8 million for fiscal 2017 and an income tax benefit of $2.7 million for fiscal 2016.

In the three months ended February 28, 2017, our subscription revenue increased by $1.0 million, or 1%, from $68.3 million in the three months ended November 30, 2016 to $69.4 million in the three months ended February 28, 2017. Our subscription revenue has continued to grow, while our appliance revenue has declined primarily due to the continuing shift by our customers from traditional and solely on-premises deployments to include the cloud.\nOur total revenue has not been significantly impacted by seasonality.\nQuarterly Gross Margin Trends\nGross profit increased sequentially for all periods presented, except the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and the third quarter of fiscal 2016, and total gross margin was between 75% and 80% for all periods presented. Our cost of revenue has increased as a function of gross billings growth. The decrease in gross margins is primarily due to increased investments to support our cloud-based solutions, including the expansion of our data center infrastructure, product mix shifts and increased service delivery costs, warranty and royalty costs, and amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of Intronis.\nQuarterly Operating Expenses Trends\nAs a percentage of revenue, quarterly operating expenses decreased sequentially, except for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, primarily due to better leverage in our cost structure, our narrowing product focus and lower sales and marketing spend. The timing of acquisition and other charges also impacted our operating expenses. In fiscal 2016, we incurred charges associated with the resolution of a self-reported export compliance matter, the settlement of an intellectual property matter and transaction costs associated with our acquisitions, which primarily caused the higher operating expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Our sales and marketing expenses may experience variability based on the timing of our marketing programs and will be dependent on the timing of strategic initiatives and investment opportunities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended February 28/29,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(59,364\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(61,744\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(59,539\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,117\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20,396\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of February 28, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $120.2 million, of which approximately $16.2 million was held outside of the United States and not presently available to fund domestic operations and obligations. In addition, we held marketable securities of $79.9 million as of February 28, 2017. If we were to repatriate cash held outside of the United States, it could be subject to U.S. income taxes, less any previously paid foreign income taxes.\nFurthermore, we renewed our $25.0 million credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB\u201d) to expire in November 2017. The credit facility includes an option to request an increase of the available funds to $50.0 million and is secured by a security interest on substantially all of our assets and contains restrictive covenants. Upon drawing the credit facility, the financial covenants will require us to maintain a minimum adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility, and a minimum adjusted quick ratio. The credit facility also sets forth specified events of default. No amounts had been drawn under the credit facility through February 28, 2017.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our available credit facility and net cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, as well as to fund any principal and interest payments on notes payable and repurchases of our common stock, for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced solutions and service offerings and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, as described in the section \"Legal Proceedings\" we are currently involved in ongoing litigation. Any adverse settlements or judgments in any litigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash balances and cash flows in the period in which such events occur.\nOperating Activities\nOur primary source of cash from operating activities has been from cash collections from our customers. We expect cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increases in sales and timing of collections. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel costs and investment in sales and marketing and research and development infrastructure. We expect cash outflows from operating activities to be affected by increases in sales and increases in personnel costs as we grow our business.\nFor fiscal 2017, operating activities provided $65.2 million in cash as a result of non-cash charges of $49.1 million related to stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expenses, our net income of $10.2 million and a positive change of $6.6 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a $14.5 million increase in deferred revenue due to an increase in sales.\nFor fiscal 2016, operating activities provided $49.3 million in cash as a result of non-cash charges of $30.9 million and a net change of $22.8 million in our net operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a net loss of $4.4 million. Non-cash charges primarily included changes in deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation and depreciation, amortization and impairment expenses. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a $19.0 million increase in deferred revenue due to an increase in sales.\nFor fiscal 2015, operating activities provided $54.1 million in cash as a result of non-cash charges of $76.5 million and a net change of $45.1 million in our net operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a net loss of $67.5 million. Non-cash charges primarily included changes in deferred income taxes and stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expenses. The non-cash change in deferred income taxes was primarily due to a valuation allowance established against significant portion of our deferred tax assets, including U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, as well as certain foreign\ndeferred tax assets. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a $59.3 million increase in deferred revenue due to an increase in sales, which also resulted in an offsetting effect from increased accounts receivable of $12.9 million.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities have generally consisted of transactions related to marketable and non-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment and activity in connection with acquisitions. We expect to continue to purchase property and equipment to support the continued growth of our business as well as continue to invest in our data center infrastructure.\nFor fiscal 2017, cash used in investing activities was $59.4 million and primarily related to purchases of marketable securities of $74.5 million, acquisition related payments of $7.0 million, purchases of property and equipment of $6.3 million, purchases of intangible assets of $1.4 million, and purchases of non-marketable investments of $1.2 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of marketable securities of $31.1 million.\nFor fiscal 2016, cash used in investing activities was $61.7 million and primarily related to our acquisition of Intronis and other acquisition related payments of $56.9 million, purchases of marketable securities of $26.0 million, purchases of property and equipment of $7.8 million and investments of $1.4 million in non-marketable securities, partially offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of certain marketable securities of $30.4 million.\nFor fiscal 2015, cash used in investing activities was $59.5 million and primarily related to purchases of marketable and non-marketable securities of $43.2 million, purchases of property and equipment of $12.5 million and our acquisition of C2C and acquisition related escrow payments of $4.8 million.\nOur annual capital expenditures generally have varied between approximately 2% and 5% of annual total revenue. We believe future capital expenditures are likely to be consistent with historical experience with variations above or below the range depending upon specific strategic opportunities.\nFinancing Activities\nOur financing activities generally consist of equity related transactions, including proceeds from the exercises of employee stock options, excess tax benefits from equity incentive plans and tax payments associated with the net share settlements of equity awards and repurchases of common stock.\nFor fiscal 2017, cash used in financing activities was $4.1 million and primarily related to repurchases of our common stock of $7.6 million and tax payments of $7.1 million related to net share settlements of equity awards. These cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $8.9 million and excess tax benefits from equity compensation plans of $1.9 million.\nFor fiscal 2016, cash used in financing activities was $20.4 million and primarily related to repurchases of our common stock of $19.2 million, tax payments of $6.7 million related to net share settlements of equity awards and payments of $2.5 million related to remittances to tax authorities for employee equity transactions. These cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $4.8 million and excess tax benefits from equity compensation plans of $3.8 million.\nFor fiscal 2015, financing activities provided $21.7 million in cash primarily as a result of proceeds from exercises of employee stock options of $16.5 million and the excess tax benefits of $9.0 million associated with such transactions, partially offset by $5.4 million in taxes paid for the net settlement of equity awards.\nKey Metrics\nWe monitor the following key metrics to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets and assess operational efficiencies. In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP and operational measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance.\nThe following presents our key metrics and provides reconciliations of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to each non-GAAP financial measure (in thousands, except active subscribers and percentages).\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended February 28/29,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross billings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>402,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>377,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>364,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year-over-year percentage increase\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year-over-year percentage increase on a constant currency basis (1)\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow as a percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Active subscribers at period end\n</td> <td>321,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>278,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>243,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>In order to determine how our business performed exclusive of the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percentage change in our gross billings from one period to another using a constant currency.

Additionally, we have modified our historical presentation of adjusted free cash flow and will no longer adjust free cash flow for the cash payment impact of acquisition and other charges.

We define gross billings as total revenue plus the change in deferred revenue and other adjustments which primarily reflect returns and reserves during a particular period. We use gross billings as a performance measurement, based on our business model of invoicing our customers at the time of sale of our solutions and recognizing revenue ratably over subsequent periods. Accordingly, we believe gross billings provide valuable insight into the sales of our solutions and the performance of our business. The gross billings we record in any period reflect sales to new customers plus renewals and additional sales to existing customers adjusted for returns, rebates and other offsets, which we do not expect to be recognized as revenue in future periods. In many cases, these returns, rebates and other offsets occur in periods different from the period of sale and are unrelated to the marketing efforts leading to the initial sale, and therefore by adjusting for such offsets, we believe our computation of gross billings better reflects the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.\nThe following table reconciles total revenue to gross billings (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended February 28/29,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>352,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>320,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>277,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deferred revenue, end of period (1)\n</td> <td>407,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>392,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>372,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: total deferred revenue, beginning of period (1)\n</td> <td>(392,774\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(372,862\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(313,157\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: deferred revenue adjustments\n</td> <td>35,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total change in deferred revenue and adjustments\n</td> <td>49,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross billings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>402,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>377,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>364,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year-over-year percentage increase\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year-over-year percentage increase on a constant currency basis (2)\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The balances for the prior fiscal years' comparable periods presented exclude any amounts related to the acquisition date deferred revenue assumed from C2C Systems Limited (\"C2C\"), which closed in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.

For example, the rates in effect at February 29, 2016, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year, were used to convert current and comparable prior period gross billings rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective period.\nGross billings increased 7% from fiscal 2016 to 2017 and 4% from fiscal 2015 to 2016. The increases in gross billings were primarily driven by our continued ability to cross-sell additional solutions to existing customers and the growth in our renewal subscriptions as a result of our high level of customer retention as well as additional lead generation opportunities and associated new customer billings. In fiscal 2017, the increase was primarily due to increased sales of our core products, such as our NextGen Firewall and Web Application Firewall solutions and the Barracuda Essentials product suite, the addition of gross billings attributable to Intronis and increased sales of our managed service solutions due primarily to the expansion of our managed service provider channel through the addition of new partners and products to the Intronis platform. The decrease in the growth rate of gross billings for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was primarily driven by weakness experienced in EMEA and in our data protection business. Additionally, in fiscal 2017 and 2016, we observed a shift by our customers from traditional and solely on-premises deployments to include the cloud, which includes hybrid network architectures, public and/or private clouds, SaaS applications and managed service solutions. These trends have led to longer sales cycles and delays in buying decisions, as well as more customers electing one-year renewal terms rather than multi-year arrangements as they evaluated their long-term strategies. When evaluating our gross billings from period to period, we also evaluate our gross billings for the comparable period using a fixed exchange rate, thereby excluding the effect of currency fluctuations.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus non-cash and non-operating charges, which include: (i) other expense, net, (ii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iii) acquisition and other charges, (iv) stock-based compensation expense, (v) amortization of intangible assets, including certain losses on disposal and impairment of intangible assets, and (vi) depreciation expense, including certain losses on disposal of fixed assets. Because adjusted EBITDA excludes certain non-cash and non-operating charges, this measure enables us to eliminate the impact of items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance, and therefore provides a better indication of profitability from our operations, and provides a consistent measure of our performance from period to period. Prior period information has been recast to conform to the current period presentation and excludes changes in deferred revenue and associated deferred costs in our calculation of adjusted EBITDA.\nThe following table reconciles net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended February 28/29,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,422\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(67,498\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td>11,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,727\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense (1)\n</td> <td>16,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>32,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition and other charges (2)\n</td> <td>612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents expenses for the amortization of intangible assets and property and equipment, as well as certain losses on disposal and impairment of long-lived assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>In calculating adjusted EBITDA, we also adjust for acquisition and other charges that we are non-recurring, infrequent and/or unusual in nature, can vary significantly in amount and frequency and are unrelated to our ongoing operating performance.

Refer to the \"Acquisition and Other Charges\" section below for additional details regarding these charges.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Adjusted EBITDA increased from $27.1 million in fiscal 2015 to $40.2 million in fiscal 2016 and $71.8 million in fiscal 2016. The increases in adjusted EBITDA were primarily driven by better leverage in our cost structure, our narrowing product focus and lower sales and marketing spend.\nFree cash flow. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment. We consider free cash flow to be a useful liquidity measure that considers the investment in cloud and corporate infrastructure required to support our business. We use free cash flow to assess our business performance and evaluate the amount of cash generated by our business after adjusting for purchases of property and equipment. Prior period information has been recast to conform to the current period presentation of free cash flow and excludes the cash payment impact of acquisition and other charges.\nThe following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended February 28/29,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: purchases of property and equipment\n</td> <td>(6,335\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,818\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,517\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow as a percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFree cash flow was consistent from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 and increased from $41.4 million in fiscal 2016 to $58.9 million in fiscal 2017. The increase in free cash flow in fiscal 2017 was driven primarily by a $15.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities as we incurred lower sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2017 due to the timing and nature of certain marketing campaigns.\nActive subscribers. We define an active subscriber as a discrete appliance, virtual appliance or cloud-only service that has activated at least one valid subscription that has not been terminated. We monitor the total number of active subscribers as a measure of the growth in our installed base, the success of our sales and marketing activities and the value that our solutions bring to our customers. As of February 28, 2017, February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, we had 321,241, 278,398 and 243,578 active subscribers, respectively. The increase in active subscribers over these periods is primarily related to our ability to attract and acquire new customers. In fiscal 2017, we renewed 92% of the expiring subscriptions, on a dollar basis, as we continued to see more customers opt for ratable subscription form factors and shorter contract lengths.\nOur non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results under GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures versus their nearest GAAP equivalents. First, gross billings, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are not substitutes for total revenue, net income (loss) and cash provided by operating activities, respectively. Second, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. Finally, adjusted EBITDA excludes some costs, namely, non-cash stock-based compensation and depreciation, amortization and impairment expenses, which are recurring. Therefore adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the non-cash impact of stock-based compensation expense or working capital needs that will continue for the foreseeable future.\nAcquisition and Other Charges\nIn calculating adjusted EBITDA, we exclude certain expense items resulting from acquisitions and other charges, which we believe are non-recurring, infrequent and/or unusual in nature, can vary significantly in amount and frequency and are unrelated to our ongoing operating performance indicative of ongoing operating performance or do not expect to recur in our continuing operating results. We believe that adjusting for these charges allows us to better compare adjusted EBITDA from period to period in order to assess the ongoing operating results of our business. We refer to costs related to our acquisitions, export compliance and intellectual property settlement as our \"acquisition and other charges\" throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These costs consist of the following:\nAcquisition and other costs. Acquisition costs (including costs associated with prospective acquisitions) include acquisition-related expenses for legal, accounting and other professional fees, integration costs, fair value remeasurements of contingent consideration obligations and contingent consideration payments made under the terms of acquisition agreements. We believe these costs are unpredictable, can vary based on the size and complexity of each transaction, and are unrelated to our core operations or those of acquired businesses. Other costs include legal expenses incurred in connection with the C2C litigation matter involving R. David Hunt, as Seller Representative of the stockholders of C2C, and costs that are non-recurring, infrequent and/or unusual in nature and can vary significantly in amount and frequency. The acquisition and other costs are classified within operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.\nExport compliance. Export compliance costs include the settlement payments and the legal expenses incurred in connection with an internal investigation of our export controls compliance procedures and the submission and final resolution of all issues associated with our voluntary self-disclosures to the U.S. government in this regard. These costs are classified as general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.\nIntellectual property settlement. Intellectual property settlement costs represent the allocated charges for the resolution of any past intellectual property infringement claims and the settlement payments. These costs are classified as general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.\nThe following table presents the details of our acquisition and other charges and their impact on adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended February 28/29,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition and other costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Export compliance\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intellectual property settlement\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nQuarterly Key Metrics\nThe following table presents unaudited key metrics for each of the eight quarters through February 28, 2017.

Our quarterly gross billings results reflect some seasonality in sales of our solutions. We typically have seasonally higher gross billings in our first and fourth quarters, as the first quarter generally experiences stronger renewals and the fourth quarter is generally driven by demand related to calendar year-end budget needs. We experienced sequential quarterly growth in fiscal 2017, whereas in fiscal 2016, we experienced lower than expected growth rates due to weakness experienced in the EMEA region and in our data protection business. Additionally, in fiscal 2017 and 2016, we observed a shift by our customers from traditional and solely on-premises deployments to include the cloud, which includes hybrid network architectures, public and/or private clouds, SaaS applications and managed service solutions. These trends led to longer sales cycles and delays in buying decisions, as well as more customers electing one-year renewal terms rather than multi-year arrangements as they evaluated their long-term strategies. We have made strategic investments in our core product offerings, which drove the sequential increases in fiscal 2017 primarily related to our NextGen Firewall and Web Application Firewall solutions and the Barracuda Essentials solution suite.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is subject to quarterly changes based on investment objectives and the timing of sales and marketing expenses based on strategic initiatives. The trends in adjusted EBITDA from period to period were based primarily upon changes in gross billings and operating expenses. Generally, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue has decreased fiscal 2017 primarily related to better leverage in our cost structure, our narrowing product focus and lower sales and marketing spend.\nFree cash flow. Free cash flow is impacted by the seasonality trends in operating expenses discussed above. Additionally, free cash flow is subject to the timing of investments in capital expenditures, which principally relate to investment in cloud and corporate infrastructure required to support the growth of our business. While our management plans for these types of infrastructure investments, the timing of the investment is driven, most importantly, by customer need, and can vary from our plan. The trends in free cash flow during the periods presented were primarily impacted by the trends in our gross billings and adjusted EBITDA.\nActive Subscribers. To date, changes in active subscribers have not been materially impacted by seasonal trends. The increase and linearity of the active subscribers is related to our ability to maintain a high renewal rate of subscriptions. Active subscribers are also impacted by our ability to attract and acquire new customers. In fiscal 2017, we renewed 92% of the expiring subscriptions, on a dollar basis, as we continued to see more customers opt for ratable subscription form factors and shorter contract lengths.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of February 28, 2017:\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations (2)\n</td> <td>4,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payable associated with debt obligations (2)\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecognized purchase commitments (3)\n</td> <td>32,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Consists of contractual obligations from office space and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Consists of debt obligations related to our corporate headquarters.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Consists of future unrecognized contractual obligations, primarily for purchase commitments of goods and services related to inventory, advertising and marketing, royalty and licensing arrangements and data center operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The contractual obligation table above excludes tax liabilities of $10.0 million related to gross unrecognized tax benefits because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement, if any, of these future payments. Additionally, we agreed to make contingent consideration payments as part of certain acquisitions, which are not included in the table above. As of February 28, 2017, we estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities to be $0.9 million. Refer to Note 3 to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of February 28, 2017, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe typically provide access to our solutions through appliances and related subscription agreements, whereby the customer is charged an upfront fee for the appliance and is required to purchase a related subscription agreement. The subscription agreements are subject to customer renewal at the end of each subscription period. Our appliances contain hardware and embedded proprietary software. The subscriptions, referred to as Barracuda Energize Updates, provide hourly spam, anti-malware and security updates, and are required to be purchased to access our solutions. The subscriptions also entitle customers to phone support and software updates on a when and if available basis. We have determined that the elements of our customer arrangements, where an appliance and subscription are both purchased, do not qualify for treatment as a separate unit of accounting. Accordingly, all fees received under these customer agreements are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, and, except for any upfront fees for the appliance, such fees are recognized ratably on a daily basis over the term of the subscription agreement. Subscription revenue also includes revenue from fixed term licenses of our managed service provider solutions, virtual appliance software, support and maintenance. Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the license. Recognition of revenue commences when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed and determinable, collectability is deemed reasonably assured and the services have commenced.\nWe receive an upfront fee from customers for delivery and transfer of title for their appliance. No further fees related to the appliance are required to be paid by the customer in subsequent periods. Because the appliance does not have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and requires a subscription agreement to access our solutions, the delivery of the appliance does not represent the culmination of a separate earnings process associated with the payment of the upfront fee. Accordingly, the amount of the upfront fee is recorded as deferred revenue upon invoicing and the amount is recognized as revenue ratably on a daily basis over the estimated average customer relationship period of three years.\nCustomers have a 30-day right to return, after which time the arrangement is non-cancelable. We make estimates and maintain a reserve for expected customer cancellations. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and management judgment.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or in our tax returns. Deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to income tax expense. Potential for recovery of deferred tax assets is evaluated by estimating the future taxable profits expected from each subsidiary and considering prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.\nWe account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements by applying a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that\nit will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.\nThe factors used to assess the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets include our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Assumptions represent management's best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. Should actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nCritical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired developed technology and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ materially from estimates. Other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nIntangible and Long-Lived Assets\nIntangible assets consist of customer relationships, trade names, acquired technology, developed software, in-process research and development and patents. Intangible assets are recorded at fair values at the date of the acquisition and, for those assets having finite useful lives, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. We periodically review our intangible and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If not recoverable, an impairment loss would be calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment, long-term prepayments, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated from the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value.\nImpairment of Non-Marketable Securities\nWe periodically review our non-marketable securities for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. We consider factors such as the duration, severity and the reason for the decline in value, the potential recovery period and whether we intend to sell. For marketable debt securities, we also consider whether (i) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities before\nrecovery of their amortized cost basis, and (ii) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write-down the security to its fair value.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to \"Recent Accounting Pronouncements\" in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "summary": "This is a detailed report on Barracuda's financial condition and results of operations, which includes information on the company's revenue, cost of revenue, gross profit, operating expenses, other income (expense), net, benefit from (provision for) income taxes, and quarterly results of operations.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The last day of our fiscal year is February 28/29. Our fiscal quarters end on May 31, August 31, November 30 and February 28/29. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth above in the section titled \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nBarracuda designs and delivers powerful yet easy-to-use security and data protection solutions. We offer cloud-enabled solutions that empower customers to address security threats, improve network performance and protect and store their data. Our security platform helps customers simplify their IT operations and address their most pressing security needs even as they adopt new deployment models and move applications, data and workloads to the cloud. Our business model is built on the core values of speed and agility, which we apply to all aspects of our approach, including our technology innovations, the delivery and deployment of our solutions and responses to customer inquiries.\nWe derive revenue from sales of appliances and subscriptions. Revenue from the sale of our appliances includes hardware and a perpetual license. Subscription revenue is generated primarily from our subscription services such as our Barracuda Energize Updates and our cloud solutions. Subscription revenue also includes revenue from fixed term licenses of our managed service provider solutions, virtual appliance software, support and maintenance. Our subscriptions include monthly and annual terms ranging from one to five years, the substantial majority of which are for one-year periods. Subscriptions are billed in advance of the purchased subscription period. Renewal rates from subscriptions, on a dollars basis, have been 92%, 93% and 94% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Subscription annual recurring revenue, which is the annualized dollar amount of recurring subscription revenue in the final month of the fiscal year, increased to $286.3 million for fiscal 2017 from $255.0 million for fiscal 2016.\nThe growth of our business and our future success depend on many factors, including our ability to continue to expand our customer base, pursue cross-sale opportunities and grow revenues from our existing customer base, expand our distribution channels, particularly internationally, continue to develop new solutions to promptly respond to our customers' needs and successfully integrate acquisitions into our business. In aligning our investments, product portfolio and routes to market to address our customers' growing adoption of public cloud, SaaS and managed service IT deployment models, we provide a security platform that spans email, management, network and application security as well as data protection, all of which can be deployed and centrally managed across diverse and distributed architectures. As our existing customers' IT buying needs evolve, or as our customers realize the benefits of the solutions that they previously purchased, our platform provides us an opportunity to cross-sell additional solutions. To support our cross-sell efforts, we intend to continue adding higher touch sales and marketing field resources to liaise with our channel partners as we continue to grow our sales both domestically and internationally. We expect that our continued investment in resources to expand our cross-sell efforts to existing customers will result in longer-term revenue growth opportunities.\nIn addition to our cross-sell efforts, our sales and marketing initiatives are primarily focused on higher-growth segments within the security and data protection markets. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to timely identify these higher-growth segments and expand our sales within them. While these areas represent significant opportunities for us, they also pose risks and challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results.\nFurthermore, our business depends on the overall demand for security and data protection solutions. Weak global economic conditions, particularly market and financial uncertainty and instability in the United States and Europe, or a reduction in security and data protection solution spending even if general economic conditions are unaffected, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results in a number of ways. Additionally, we face significant competition across all of our market segments, and must continue to execute across all functions and add qualified personnel to succeed.\nOur Business Model\nWe generally invoice at the time of sale for the total price of the solutions we deliver, and we typically collect cash in 30 to 60 days. We refer to the total amount of invoices we issue in a period as gross billings. All of the gross billings we record are recognized as revenue ratably under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), once all revenue recognition\ncriteria have been met. Gross billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue, less reserves. The hardware appliance component of our gross billings is recognized ratably as revenue over the estimated customer relationship period, which is typically three years, commencing upon the activation of the unit by the end customer. The subscription component of our gross billings is recognized ratably as revenue over the contractual period of the subscription. Because we typically bill in advance for the entire term, substantially all of our new and renewal gross billings increase our deferred revenue balance, which contributes significantly to our cash flow.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from the sales of our appliances and subscriptions.\n \u2022 Appliance Revenue. Revenue from the sale of our appliances includes hardware and a perpetual software license. We recognize hardware appliance revenue over the estimated customer relationship period of three years, commencing with the end-user's activation of the appliance and related subscription, provided all other criteria for the recognition of appliance revenue are met. \n \u2022 Subscription Revenue. Subscription revenue is generated primarily from our subscription services such as our Barracuda Energize Updates. Subscription revenue also includes revenue from fixed term licenses of our virtual appliance software, support and maintenance. Our subscription terms include monthly and annual terms ranging from one year to five years, the substantial majority of which are for one year periods. We recognize revenue from subscriptions, support and maintenance over the contractual service period.  Cost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of costs related to our appliance and subscription revenue. Such costs include hardware, manufacturing, shipping and logistics, customer support, royalty, warranty, personnel costs, service delivery and data center costs and amortization of intangible assets related to acquired technology. We expect our cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars, although it may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period, as we continue to grow.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of total revenue, or gross margin, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including manufacturing costs, cost of technical support and the mix of our solutions sold. We expect our gross profit to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and travel-related expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs for facilities, IT and depreciation. We expect operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars, although they may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period, as we continue to grow. In particular, we expect our stock-based compensation expense to increase in absolute dollars as a result of our existing stock-based compensation expense to be recognized as options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") vest and as we issue additional stock-based awards to attract and retain employees.\n \u2022 Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for employees and executives on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease-of-use of our appliance and subscription services, as well as the development of new products. We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future solutions, although our research and development expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue. \n \u2022 Sales and marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising, as well as salaries, commissions, benefits and stock-based compensation for our employees and executives engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development and customer service functions. Our advertising expenses include the costs of cooperative marketing programs developed with our channel partners and other marketing programs such as online lead generation, promotional events and web seminars. We market and sell our subscription services worldwide \nthrough our sales organization and distribution channels, such as strategic resellers and distributors. We capitalize and amortize the direct and incremental portion of our sales commissions over the period the related revenue is recognized. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to introduce marketing campaigns and invest in sales resources in key focus areas, although our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\n \u2022 General and administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our finance, legal, regulatory and compliance, human resources and other administrative employees and executives. In addition, general and administrative expenses include outside consulting, legal and accounting services and facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars due to professional services fees primarily related to outside legal, audit, investor relations and consulting services to support the business, although our general and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.  Other Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses, interest expense on our outstanding debt and interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as well as realized gains and losses from our marketable securities portfolio. We expect interest income will vary each reporting period depending on our average investment balances during the period, types and mix of investments and market interest rates.\nBenefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes\nOur benefit from (provision for) income taxes consists primarily of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves determining income tax expense together with calculating the deferred income tax expense related to temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, along with net operating loss and credits carryforwards, if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize our consolidated results of operations for the periods presented (dollars in thousands) and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods.\n\n\nComparison of the Fiscal Years Ended February 28, 2017 and February 29, 2016\nRevenue\n\nTotal revenue increased $32.5 million, or 10%, for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Subscription revenue increased by $39.0 million, or 17%, primarily due to a 15% increase in active subscribers from 278,398 active subscribers as of February 29, 2016 to 321,241 active subscribers as of February 28, 2017. The increase in active subscribers was primarily driven by our high level of customer retention and an increase in the number of customers purchasing subscriptions from us. Total appliance revenue decreased by $6.5 million, or 7%, primarily due to the continuing shift by our customers from traditional and solely on-premises deployments to include the cloud, which includes hybrid network architectures, public and/or private clouds, SaaS applications and managed service solutions.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\n\nCost of revenue increased for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 commensurate with the increase in total revenue for the comparable periods. Gross margin decreased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to product mix shifts and increases of $3.5 million in service delivery costs, $3.5 million in warranty and royalty costs, $1.8 million in amortization of intangible assets and $1.1 million in depreciation expenses. Additionally, our gross margin is generally impacted by the timing of investments in our data center infrastructure and our technical support.\nOperating Expenses\n\nResearch and development expenses increased $3.8 million, or 5%, in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to increases of $3.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, $1.6 million in consulting costs and $0.7 million in compensation and personnel related costs, partially offset by decreases of $0.8 million in travel and other related costs, $0.5 million in equipment and service expenses, $0.4 million in IT-related infrastructure expenses and $0.1 million in depreciation expense. As a percentage of total revenue, research and development expenses remained relatively consistent year over year.\nSales and marketing expenses decreased $8.6 million, or 6%, in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to decreases of $15.2 million in marketing and channel partner program expenses, primarily attributable to lower search engine\nmarketing, sponsorship and advertising spend and event and trade show costs, $0.8 million in travel and other related costs and $0.3 million in IT-related infrastructure expenses, partially offset by increases of $5.0 million in compensation and personnel costs, primarily attributable to higher sales commission attainment, $1.5 million in stock-based compensation expense, $0.5 million in consulting costs and $0.4 million in license and service fees. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing expenses decreased year over year primarily due to the timing and nature of marketing campaigns.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $5.3 million, or 11%, in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to decreases of $4.2 million in legal and settlement costs, which included a $2.3 million settlement charge for intellectual property matters and a $1.5 million settlement of an export compliance matter in fiscal 2016, $1.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, $0.5 million in travel and other related costs, $0.4 million in consulting costs and $0.3 million in equipment and software expense, partially offset by increases of $0.5 million in bad debt expense, $0.5 million in compensation and personnel related costs, $0.4 million in depreciation expense and $0.1 million in payment processing costs. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased year over year due to the legal and settlement costs associated with the matters noted above not recurring in fiscal 2017.\nOther Expense, Net\n\nThe change in other expense, net was due primarily to an increase of $1.1 million in realized gains from the sale of marketable securities, partially offset by an increase of $0.8 million in net foreign exchange losses during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.\nBenefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes\n\nWe recorded an income tax provision of $11.8 million for fiscal 2017 and an income tax benefit of $2.7 million for fiscal 2016. We established a valuation allowance in fiscal 2015 against a significant portion of our deferred tax assets, including U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, as well as certain foreign deferred tax assets, because realization of these tax benefits through future taxable income does not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold. We intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal. The difference between the income tax provision that would be derived by applying the statutory rate to our income before tax and the income tax provision actually recorded for fiscal 2017 is primarily due to the temporary differences, which we do not expect to benefit from due to our valuation allowance, non-deductible stock-based compensation expense and other currently non-deductible items.\nComparison of the Fiscal Years Ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015\nRevenue\n\nTotal revenue increased $42.7 million, or 15%, for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Subscription revenue increased by $36.6 million, or 19%, primarily due to a 14% increase in active subscribers from 243,578 active subscribers as of February 28, 2015 to 278,398 active subscribers as of February 29, 2016. The increase in active subscribers was primarily driven by our high level of customer retention and an increase in the number of customers purchasing subscriptions from us. Total appliance revenue grew by $6.1 million, or 7%, due to increased demand for our solutions, however, the growth rate decreased from the previous period due to an increasing number of customers shifting from traditional and solely on-premises deployments to include the cloud.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\n\nCost of revenue increased for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 commensurate with the increase in appliance and subscription revenue for the comparable periods. Gross margin decreased slightly in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The slight decrease was primarily due to product mix shifts and increased amortization of intangible assets and depreciation expenses. Additionally, our gross margin is generally impacted by the timing of investments in our data center infrastructure and our technical support.\nOperating Expenses\n\nResearch and development expenses increased $12.5 million, or 21%, in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to increases of $5.9 million in compensation and personnel related costs primarily attributable to a 9% increase in the average research and development headcount throughout fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and our acquisition of Intronis in October 2015, $3.8 million in stock-based compensation expense, $0.9 million in consulting costs, $0.8 million in IT-related infrastructure expenses, $0.4 million in equipment and service expenses, $0.3 million in travel and other related costs and $0.2 million in license and service fees. As a percentage of total revenue, research and development expenses remained consistent year over year.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $12.8 million, or 10%, in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to increases of $7.6 million in compensation and personnel related costs, primarily attributable to an 18% increase in the average sales and marketing headcount throughout fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and our acquisition of Intronis, $2.8 million in stock-based compensation expense, $1.2 million in amortization expense associated with the acquisition of Intronis and impairment charges related to certain acquisition-related customer relationship assets and $0.7 million in IT-related infrastructure expenses. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing expenses slightly decreased year over year primarily due to a reversal of estimated contingent consideration obligations, which resulted in a $1.3 million reduction of compensation and personnel related costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $11.9 million, or 34%, in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to increases of $4.8 million in legal, compliance and consulting costs, which included a $2.3 million settlement charge for intellectual property matters and a $1.5 million settlement related to export compliance, $4.5 million in stock-based\ncompensation expense, $0.9 million in compensation and personnel related costs, primarily attributable to a 4% increase in the average general and administrative headcount throughout fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and our acquisition of Intronis, $0.6 million in equipment and software expense, $0.6 million in depreciation expense and $0.2 million in payment processing costs. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expenses slightly increased year over year primarily due to increased legal and settlement costs.\nOther Expense, Net\n\nThe change in other expense, net was due primarily to a decrease of $3.5 million in net foreign exchange losses during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nBenefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes\n\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $2.7 million for fiscal 2016 and an income tax provision of $62.9 million for fiscal 2015. We established a valuation allowance in fiscal 2015 against a significant portion of our deferred tax assets, including U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, as well as certain foreign deferred tax assets, because realization of these tax benefits through future taxable income does not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold. We intend to maintain the valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowances. The difference between the income tax benefit that would be derived by applying the statutory rate to our loss before tax and the income tax benefit actually recorded for fiscal 2016 is primarily due to the change in the valuation allowance, as well as non-deductible stock-based compensation expense and other currently non-deductible items, offset by the tax benefit from the tax credits.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended February 28, 2017, as well as the percentage that each line item represents of total revenue. The information for", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The last day of our fiscal year is February 28/29. Our fiscal quarters end on May 31, August 31, November 30 and February 28/29. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth above in the section titled \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nBarracuda designs and delivers powerful yet easy-to-use security and data protection solutions. We offer cloud-enabled solutions that empower customers to address security threats, improve network performance and protect and store their data. Our security platform helps customers simplify their IT operations and address their most pressing security needs even as they adopt new deployment models and move applications, data and workloads to the cloud. Our business model is built on the core values of speed and agility, which we apply to all aspects of our approach, including our technology innovations, the delivery and deployment of our solutions and responses to customer inquiries.\nWe derive revenue from sales of appliances and subscriptions. Revenue from the sale of our appliances includes hardware and a perpetual license. Subscription revenue is generated primarily from our subscription services such as our Barracuda Energize Updates and our cloud solutions. Subscription revenue also includes revenue from fixed term licenses of our managed service provider solutions, virtual appliance software, support and maintenance. Our subscriptions include monthly and annual terms ranging from one to five years, the substantial majority of which are for one-year periods. Subscriptions are billed in advance of the purchased subscription period. Renewal rates from subscriptions, on a dollars basis, have been 92%, 93% and 94% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Subscription annual recurring revenue, which is the annualized dollar amount of recurring subscription revenue in the final month of the fiscal year, increased to $286.3 million for fiscal 2017 from $255.0 million for fiscal 2016.\nThe growth of our business and our future success depend on many factors, including our ability to continue to expand our customer base, pursue cross-sale opportunities and grow revenues from our existing customer base, expand our distribution channels, particularly internationally, continue to develop new solutions to promptly respond to our customers' needs and successfully integrate acquisitions into our business. In aligning our investments, product portfolio and routes to market to address our customers' growing adoption of public cloud, SaaS and managed service IT deployment models, we provide a security platform that spans email, management, network and application security as well as data protection, all of which can be deployed and centrally managed across diverse and distributed architectures. As our existing customers' IT buying needs evolve, or as our customers realize the benefits of the solutions that they previously purchased, our platform provides us an opportunity to cross-sell additional solutions. To support our cross-sell efforts, we intend to continue adding higher touch sales and marketing field resources to liaise with our channel partners as we continue to grow our sales both domestically and internationally. We expect that our continued investment in resources to expand our cross-sell efforts to existing customers will result in longer-term revenue growth opportunities.\nIn addition to our cross-sell efforts, our sales and marketing initiatives are primarily focused on higher-growth segments within the security and data protection markets. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to timely identify these higher-growth segments and expand our sales within them. While these areas represent significant opportunities for us, they also pose risks and challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results.\nFurthermore, our business depends on the overall demand for security and data protection solutions. Weak global economic conditions, particularly market and financial uncertainty and instability in the United States and Europe, or a reduction in security and data protection solution spending even if general economic conditions are unaffected, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results in a number of ways. Additionally, we face significant competition across all of our market segments, and must continue to execute across all functions and add qualified personnel to succeed.\nOur Business Model\nWe generally invoice at the time of sale for the total price of the solutions we deliver, and we typically collect cash in 30 to 60 days. We refer to the total amount of invoices we issue in a period as gross billings. All of the gross billings we record are recognized as revenue ratably under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), once all revenue recognition\ncriteria have been met. Gross billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue, less reserves. The hardware appliance component of our gross billings is recognized ratably as revenue over the estimated customer relationship period, which is typically three years, commencing upon the activation of the unit by the end customer. The subscription component of our gross billings is recognized ratably as revenue over the contractual period of the subscription. Because we typically bill in advance for the entire term, substantially all of our new and renewal gross billings increase our deferred revenue balance, which contributes significantly to our cash flow.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from the sales of our appliances and subscriptions.\n \u2022 Appliance Revenue. Revenue from the sale of our appliances includes hardware and a perpetual software license. We recognize hardware appliance revenue over the estimated customer relationship period of three years, commencing with the end-user's activation of the appliance and related subscription, provided all other criteria for the recognition of appliance revenue are met. \n \u2022 Subscription Revenue. Subscription revenue is generated primarily from our subscription services such as our Barracuda Energize Updates. Subscription revenue also includes revenue from fixed term licenses of our virtual appliance software, support and maintenance. Our subscription terms include monthly and annual terms ranging from one year to five years, the substantial majority of which are for one year periods. We recognize revenue from subscriptions, support and maintenance over the contractual service period.  Cost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of costs related to our appliance and subscription revenue. Such costs include hardware, manufacturing, shipping and logistics, customer support, royalty, warranty, personnel costs, service delivery and data center costs and amortization of intangible assets related to acquired technology. We expect our cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars, although it may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period, as we continue to grow.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of total revenue, or gross margin, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including manufacturing costs, cost of technical support and the mix of our solutions sold. We expect our gross profit to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and travel-related expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs for facilities, IT and depreciation. We expect operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars, although they may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period, as we continue to grow. In particular, we expect our stock-based compensation expense to increase in absolute dollars as a result of our existing stock-based compensation expense to be recognized as options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") vest and as we issue additional stock-based awards to attract and retain employees.\n \u2022 Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for employees and executives on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease-of-use of our appliance and subscription services, as well as the development of new products. We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future solutions, although our research and development expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue. \n \u2022 Sales and marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising, as well as salaries, commissions, benefits and stock-based compensation for our employees and executives engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development and customer service functions. Our advertising expenses include the costs of cooperative marketing programs developed with our channel partners and other marketing programs such as online lead generation, promotional events and web seminars. We market and sell our subscription services worldwide \nthrough our sales organization and distribution channels, such as strategic resellers and distributors. We capitalize and amortize the direct and incremental portion of our sales commissions over the period the related revenue is recognized. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to introduce marketing campaigns and invest in sales resources in key focus areas, although our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\n \u2022 General and administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our finance, legal, regulatory and compliance, human resources and other administrative employees and executives. In addition, general and administrative expenses include outside consulting, legal and accounting services and facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars due to professional services fees primarily related to outside legal, audit, investor relations and consulting services to support the business, although our general and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.  Other Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses, interest expense on our outstanding debt and interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as well as realized gains and losses from our marketable securities portfolio. We expect interest income will vary each reporting period depending on our average investment balances during the period, types and mix of investments and market interest rates.\nBenefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes\nOur benefit from (provision for) income taxes consists primarily of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves determining income tax expense together with calculating the deferred income tax expense related to temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, along with net operating loss and credits carryforwards, if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize our consolidated results of operations for the periods presented (dollars in thousands) and as a percentage of our total revenue for

We established a valuation allowance in fiscal 2015 against a significant portion of our deferred tax assets, including U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, as well as certain foreign deferred tax assets, because realization of these tax benefits through future taxable income does not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold. We intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal. The difference between the income tax provision that would be derived by applying the statutory rate to our income before tax and the income tax provision actually recorded for fiscal 2017 is primarily due to the temporary differences, which we do not expect to benefit from due to our valuation allowance, non-deductible stock-based compensation expense and other currently non-deductible items.\nComparison of the Fiscal Years Ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015\nRevenue\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended February 28/29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Appliance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription\n</td> <td>230,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>194,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>320,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>277,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue increased $42.7 million, or 15%, for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.

Additionally, our gross margin is generally impacted by the timing of investments in our data center infrastructure and our technical support.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended February 28/29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>138,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>47,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>256,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>219,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses increased $12.5 million, or 21%, in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to increases of $5.9 million in compensation and personnel related costs primarily attributable to a 9% increase in the average research and development headcount throughout fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and our acquisition of Intronis in October 2015, $3.8 million in stock-based compensation expense, $0.9 million in consulting costs, $0.8 million in IT-related infrastructure expenses, $0.4 million in equipment and service expenses, $0.3 million in travel and other related costs and $0.2 million in license and service fees. As a percentage of total revenue, research and development expenses remained consistent year over year.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $12.8 million, or 10%, in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to increases of $7.6 million in compensation and personnel related costs, primarily attributable to an 18% increase in the average sales and marketing headcount throughout fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and our acquisition of Intronis, $2.8 million in stock-based compensation expense, $1.2 million in amortization expense associated with the acquisition of Intronis and impairment charges related to certain acquisition-related customer relationship assets and $0.7 million in IT-related infrastructure expenses. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing expenses slightly decreased year over year primarily due to a reversal of estimated contingent consideration obligations, which resulted in a $1.3 million reduction of compensation and personnel related costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $11.9 million, or 34%, in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to increases of $4.8 million in legal, compliance and consulting costs, which included a $2.3 million settlement charge for intellectual property matters and a $1.5 million settlement related to export compliance, $4.5 million in stock-based\ncompensation expense, $0.9 million in compensation and personnel related costs, primarily attributable to a 4% increase in the average general and administrative headcount throughout fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and our acquisition of Intronis, $0.6 million in equipment and software expense, $0.6 million in depreciation expense and $0.2 million in payment processing costs.

We established a valuation allowance in fiscal 2015 against a significant portion of our deferred tax assets, including U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, as well as certain foreign deferred tax assets, because realization of these tax benefits through future taxable income does not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold. We intend to maintain the valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowances. The difference between the income tax benefit that would be derived by applying the statutory rate to our loss before tax and the income tax benefit actually recorded for fiscal 2016 is primarily due to the change in the valuation allowance, as well as non-deductible stock-based compensation expense and other currently non-deductible items, offset by the tax benefit from the tax credits.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended February 28, 2017, as well as the percentage that each line item represents of total revenue.
