The forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include statements as to:\n\u2022our and our portfolio companies' future operating results and financial condition, including the ability of us and our portfolio companies to achieve our respective objectives;\n\u2022our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies;\n\u2022our relationships with third parties, including but not limited to lenders and venture capital investors, including other investors in our portfolio companies;\n\u2022the impact and timing of our unfunded commitments;\n\u2022the expected market for venture capital investments;\n\u2022the performance of our existing portfolio and other investments we may make in the future;\n\u2022the impact of investments that we expect to make;\n\u2022actual and potential conflicts of interest with TPC, the Adviser and its senior investment team and Investment Committee;\n\u2022our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties;\n\u2022the dependence of our future success on the U.S. and global economies, including with respect to the industries in which we invest;\n\u2022our expected financings and investments;\n\u2022the ability of the Adviser to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments;\n\u2022the ability of our Adviser to attract, retain and have access to highly talented professionals, including our Adviser's senior management team;\n\u2022our ability to maintain our qualification as a RIC and as a BDC;\n\u2022the adequacy of our available liquidity, cash resources and working capital and compliance with covenants under our borrowing arrangements; and\n\u2022the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies.\nThese statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation:\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations, changes in political, economic or industry conditions, and changes in the interest rate environment or other conditions affecting the financial and capital markets, including with respect to changes resulting from or in response to, or potentially even the absence of changes as a result of, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the length and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States as well as worldwide, and the magnitude of its impact and time required for economic recovery, including with respect to the impact of travel restrictions and other isolation and quarantine measures on the ability of the Adviser's investment professionals to conduct in-person diligence on, and otherwise monitor, existing and future investments;\n\u2022an economic downturn and the time period required for robust economic recovery therefrom, including relating to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already generally had a material impact on our portfolio companies' results of operations and financial condition and will likely continue to have a material impact on our portfolio companies' results of operations and financial condition for its duration, which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition;\n\u2022a contraction of available credit, an inability or unwillingness of our lenders to fund their commitments to us and/or an inability to access capital markets or additional sources of liquidity, including as a result of the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and impair our lending and investment activities;\n\u2022interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results, particularly given that we use leverage as part of our investment strategy;\n\u2022currency fluctuations could adversely affect the results of our investments in foreign companies, particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in foreign currency rather than U.S. dollars;\n\u2022risks associated with possible disruption in our or our portfolio companies' operations due to wars and other forms of conflict, terrorist acts, security operations and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and global health epidemics; and\n\u2022the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify in Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A, and in our other filings with the SEC that we make from time to time.\nAlthough we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include, without limitation, our ability to originate new loans and investments, borrowing costs and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our shares are currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE\u201d) under the symbol TPVG\u201d.\nWe were formed to expand the venture growth stage business segment of TPC's investment platform. TPC is widely recognized as a leading global financing provider devoted to serving venture capital-backed companies with creative, flexible and customized debt financing, equity capital and complementary services throughout their lifespan. TPC is located on Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley and has a primary focus in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries.\nOur investment objective is to maximize our total return to stockholders primarily in the form of current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by lending primarily with warrants to venture growth stage companies focused in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries backed by TPC's select group of leading venture capital investors.\nCOVID-19 Developments\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and the related effect on the U.S. and global economies, including the recent economic downturn and the uncertainty associated with the timing and likelihood of economic recovery, has had adverse consequences for the business operations of some of our portfolio companies and has adversely affected, and threatens to continue to adversely affect, our operations and the operations of the Adviser.\nWhile we have been monitoring, and continue to monitor, the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our and our portfolio companies' business, we have continued to raise capital, maintain appropriate levels of available liquidity, support and monitor our existing portfolio companies, fund existing unfunded commitments, and selectively deploy capital in new investment opportunities in venture capital-backed companies.\nWe have seen, and may continue to see, certain of our portfolio companies experience financial distress and, depending on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the extent of its disruption to operations, believe that there is an increased risk of certain of our portfolio companies defaulting on their financial obligations to us and their other capital providers. In addition, as a result of the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related disruption and financial distress, certain portfolio companies may seek to modify their loans from us, which could reduce the amount or extend the time for payment of principal, reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest, and/or increase the amount of PIK interest we receive with respect to such investment, among other things. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have also impeded, and may continue to impede, the ability of certain of our portfolio companies to raise additional capital and/or pursue asset sales or otherwise execute strategic transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on the valuation of our investments in such companies. Portfolio companies operating in certain industries may be more susceptible to these risks than other portfolio companies in other industries in light of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of our portfolio companies previously took steps to significantly reduce, modify, or alter business strategies and operations, and additional portfolio companies may take similar steps if subjected to prolonged and severe financial distress, which may impair their business on a permanent basis. In addition, as a result of the ongoing adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that future equity rounds completed by our portfolio companies will be at levels greater than or equal to previous rounds, which may result in net unrealized depreciation on our warrant and equity portfolio in future periods.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had one portfolio company in which our investment was on non-accrual status (which was generally caused by events unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic), with an aggregate cost and fair value of $29.5 million and $11.3 million, respectively. The various effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those discussed above, increase the risk that we will place additional investments on non-accrual status in the future. Any significant increase in aggregate unrealized depreciation of our investment portfolio or significant reductions in our net asset value as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise increases the risk of failing to meet the 1940 Act asset coverage requirements and breaching covenants under the Credit Facility, or under the governing agreements for the 2025 Notes and the 2026 Notes, or otherwise triggering an event of default under our borrowing arrangements. Any such breach of covenant or event of default, if we are not able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders or debt holders, would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. See Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A for more information. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act and with our covenants under the Credit Facility and under the governing agreements for the 2025 Notes and the 2026 Notes.\nWe will continue to monitor the evolving situation relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and related guidance from U.S. and international authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities. Given the dynamic nature of this situation and the fact that there may be developments outside of our control that require us or our portfolio companies to adjust plans of operation, we cannot reasonably estimate the full impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future. However, it could have a material adverse impact for a prolonged period of time on our future net investment income, particularly with respect to our interest income, the fair value of our portfolio investments, and the results of operations and financial condition of us and our portfolio companies. See Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A, and in our other filings with the SEC that we make from time to time, for more information.\nPortfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Asset Quality\nPortfolio Composition\nWe originate and invest primarily in venture growth stage companies. Companies at the venture growth stage have distinct characteristics differentiating them from venture capital-backed companies at other stages in their development lifecycle. We invest primarily in (i) growth capital loans that have a secured collateral position and that are generally used by venture growth stage companies to finance their continued expansion and growth, (ii) equipment financings, which may be structured as loans or leases, that have a secured collateral position on specified mission-critical equipment, (iii) on a select basis, revolving loans that have a secured collateral position and that are typically used by venture growth stage companies to advance against inventory, components, accounts receivable, contractual or future billings, bookings, revenues, sales or cash payments and collections including proceeds from a sale, financing or the equivalent and (iv) direct equity investments in venture growth stage companies. In connection with our growth capital loans, equipment financings and revolving loans, we generally receive warrant investments as part of the transaction that allow us to participate in any equity appreciation of our borrowers and enhance our overall investment returns.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 246 investments in 91 companies. Our investments included 107 debt investments, 92 warrant investments, and 47 direct equity and related investments. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate cost and fair value of these investments were $837.8 million and $865.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, 10 of our portfolio companies were publicly traded. As of December 31, 2021, the 107 debt investments had an aggregate fair value of $757.2 million and a weighted average loan to enterprise value ratio at the time of underwriting of 7.7%. Enterprise value of a portfolio company is estimated based on information available, including any information regarding the most recent rounds of equity funding, at the time of origination.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 195 investments in 69 companies. Our investments included 94 debt investments, 75 warrant investments, and 26 direct equity and related investments. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate cost and fair value of these investments were $662.4 million and $633.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, one of our portfolio companies was publicly traded. As of December 31, 2020, the 94 debt investments had an aggregate fair value of $583.3 million and a weighted average loan to enterprise value ratio at the time of underwriting of 8.9%. Enterprise value of a portfolio company is estimated based on information available, including any information regarding the most recent rounds of equity funding, at the time of origination.\nThe following tables show information on the cost and fair value of our investments in companies along with the number of companies in our portfolio as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments by Type\n(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Cost </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Unrealized Gains (losses) </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of\nInvestments </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of\nCompanies </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt investments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>774,652 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>757,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17,430) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warrant investments </td> <td> </td> <td>25,597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,159 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity investments </td> <td> </td> <td>37,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,762 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Investments in Portfolio Companies </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>837,849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>865,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n(1)Represents non-duplicative number of companies.\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments by Type\n(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Cost </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Unrealized Gains (losses) </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of\nInvestments </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of\nCompanies </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt investments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>613,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>583,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(30,010) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warrant investments </td> <td> </td> <td>20,525 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,231 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,706 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity investments </td> <td> </td> <td>28,553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,340) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Investments in Portfolio Companies </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>662,423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>633,779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(28,644) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td> </td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n</table> _______________\n(1)Represents non-duplicative number of companies.\nThe following tables show the fair value of the portfolio of investments, by industry and the percentage of the total investment portfolio, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments in Portfolio Companies by Industry\n(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>At Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of Total Investments </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business Applications Software </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>114,109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>E-Commerce -

During the three months ended December 31, 2020, portfolio company credit category changes, excluding fundings and repayments, consisted of the following: one portfolio company with a principal balance of $25.0 million was upgraded from White (2) to Clear (1); one portfolio company with a principal balance of $21.4 million was upgraded from Yellow (3) to White (2); one portfolio company with a principal balance of $10.0 million was removed from Yellow (3) as a result of prepayment in full; one portfolio company with a principal balance of $25.0 million was downgraded from White (2) to Yellow (3); and one portfolio company with a principal balance of $29.5 million was downgraded from Yellow (3) to Red (5).\nResults of Operations\nSet forth below is a comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The comparison of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 can be found within Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included in Part II of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nComparison of operating results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nAn important measure of our financial performance is net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income (loss), net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized gains (losses). Net investment income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating expenses including interest on borrowed funds. Net realized gains (losses) on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost. Net unrealized gains (losses) on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $76.6 million, which was comprised of $41.1 million of net investment income and $35.5 million of net realized and unrealized gains. On a per share basis for the year ended December 31, 2021, net investment income was $1.33 per share and the net increase in net assets from operations was $2.47 per share.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $35.3 million, which was comprised of $47.9 million of net investment income and $12.5 million of net realized and unrealized losses. On a per share basis for the year ended December 31, 2020, net investment income was $1.57 per share and the net increase in net assets from operations was $1.16 per share.\nInvestment Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, total investment income was $87.4 million as compared to $91.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020, is primarily due to a lower weighted average principal amount outstanding on our income-bearing debt investment portfolio, partially offset by increased prepayment activity.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized $4.6 million in other income consisting of $1.0 million due to the termination or expiration of unfunded commitments, and $3.6 million from the realization of certain fees paid and accrued from portfolio companies and other income related to prepayment activity. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $2.6 million in other income consisting of $1.4 million due to the termination or expiration of unfunded commitments, and $1.2 million from the realization of certain fees paid and accrued from portfolio companies and other income related to prepayment activity.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses consist of our base management fee, income incentive fee, capital gains incentive fee, interest expense and amortization of fees, administration agreement expenses, and general and administrative expenses. In determining the base management fee, our Adviser has agreed to exclude U.S. Treasury bill assets acquired at the end of each applicable quarter from the calculation of the gross assets. We anticipate operating expenses will increase over time as our portfolio continues to grow. However, we anticipate operating expenses, as a percentage of totals assets and net assets, will generally decrease over time as our portfolio and capital base expand. We expect base management and income incentive fees will increase as we grow our asset base and our earnings. The capital gains incentive fee will depend on realized and unrealized gains and losses. Interest expenses will generally increase as we utilize more of the Credit Facility and issue additional debt securities, and we generally expect expenses under the administration agreement and general and administrative expenses to increase over time to meet the additional requirements associated with servicing a larger portfolio.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, total operating expenses were $46.3 million as compared to $43.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nBase management fees totaled $12.5 million and $12.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Base management fees for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to December 31, 2020, increased primarily due to an increase in average assets during the applicable periods used in the calculation.\nIncome incentive fees totaled $10.3 million and $8.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our income incentive fee was reduced by $2.6 million due to the total return requirement under the income component of our incentive fee structure, which resulted in a corresponding increase of $2.6 million in net investment income.\nThere was no capital gains incentive fee expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nInterest expense and amortization of fees for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled $17.4 million and $15.5 million, respectively. Interest expense and amortization of fees for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to December 31, 2020, increased due to the issuance of the 2026 Notes, partially offset by a lower weighted-average outstanding principal balance under the Credit Facility as well as the redemption of the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 5.75% notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes\u201d).\nAdministration agreement and general and administrative expenses totaled $6.1 million and $6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to December 31, 2020, was primarily due to a lower allocation of administration expenses under the Administration Agreement as well as lower third-party expenses.\nNet Realized Gains and Losses and Net Unrealized Gains and Losses\nRealized gains and losses are included in net realized gains (losses) on investments\u201d in the consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized net realized losses of $20.0 million, consisting primarily of $15.6 million of realized losses from the sale of our investment in Knotel, Inc., which was rated Red (5) on our credit watch list, and its removal from our investment portfolio, a $2.1 million realized loss from the write-off of an equity investment, $2.2 million of realized losses from the termination of warrants, and $0.1 million of other net realized losses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized net realized gains of $8.6 million from the sale of investments, consisting of $28.8 million of realized gains from the sale of publicly traded shares held in CrowdStrike, Inc. and Medallia, Inc., and $0.8 million of realized gains from the sale of warrants in Freshly Inc., offset by $20.1 million of realized losses from the finalization of asset sales and removal from our investment portfolio of three obligors, Cambridge Broadband Network Limited, Harvest Power, Inc., and Munchery, Inc., which were rated Red (5) on our credit watch list, and $0.9 million of other net realized losses.\nUnrealized gains and losses are included in net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments\u201d in the consolidated statements of operations.\nNet change in unrealized gains during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $56.1 million, resulting primarily from $41.2 million of net unrealized gains from fair value adjustments on our warrant and equity portfolio, the reversal and recognition of $15.6 million of previously recorded unrealized losses associated with Knotel, Inc., and the reversal of $2.8 million of previously recorded net unrealized losses on other investments realized during the period, partially offset by $3.5 million of net unrealized losses on our debt investment portfolio resulting from fair value adjustments.\nNet change in unrealized losses during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $21.1 million, resulting primarily from the reversal and recognition of $14.3 million of previously recorded unrealized gains associated with the shares of CrowdStrike, Inc. and Medallia, Inc. that we sold during the year, as well as net unrealized losses on our investment portfolio during the year resulting from fair value adjustments, partially offset by the reversal and recognition of $19.4 million of previously recorded unrealized losses associated with three obligors rated Red (5) on our credit watch list.\nNet change in realized and unrealized gains or losses in subsequent periods may be volatile as such results depend on changes in the market, changes in the underlying performance of our portfolio companies and their respective industries, and other market factors.\nOn April 5, 2021, we redeemed the entire $74.75 million aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes in full. In connection with the redemption, we recognized a realized loss of $0.7 million, which is included in net realized loss on extinguishment of debt\u201d in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPortfolio Yield and Total Return\nInvestment income includes interest income on our debt investments utilizing the effective yield method including cash interest income as well as the amortization of any purchase premium, accretion of purchase discount, original issue discount, facilities fees, and the amortization and payment of the end-of-term ( EOT\u201d) payments. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, interest income totaled $82.8 million and $88.6 million, respectively, representing a weighted average annualized portfolio yield on total debt investments for the period held of 13.7% and 13.8%, respectively.\nWe calculate weighted average annualized portfolio yields for periods shown as the annualized rates of the interest income recognized during the period divided by the average amortized cost of debt investments in the portfolio during the period. The weighted average yields reported for these periods are annualized and reflect the weighted average yields to maturities. Should the portfolio companies choose to repay their loans earlier, our weighted average yields will increase for those debt investments affected but may reduce our weighted average yields on the remaining portfolio in future quarters.\nThe yield on our total debt portfolio, excluding the impact of prepayments, was 12.1% and 12.5% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe following table shows the weighted average annualized portfolio yield on our total debt portfolio for the periods presented, comprising of cash interest income, accretion of the net purchase discount, facilities fees and the value of warrant investments received, accretion of EOT payments and the accelerated receipt of EOT payments on prepayments:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratios\n(Percentages, on an annualized basis)(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average annualized portfolio yield on total debt investments(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coupon income </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accretion of discount </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accretion of end-of-term payments </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of prepayments during the period </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> _____________\n(1)Weighted average portfolio yields on total debt investments for periods shown are the annualized rates of interest income recognized during the period divided by the average amortized cost of debt investments in the portfolio during the period.\n(2)The weighted average portfolio yields on total debt investments reflected above do not represent actual investment returns to our stockholders.\nOur weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments may be higher than an investor's yield on an investment in shares of our common stock. Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments does not reflect operating expenses that may be incurred by us and, thus, by our stockholders. In addition, our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments and total return figures disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K do not consider the effect of any sales commissions or charges that may be incurred in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock. Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments and total return figures do not represent actual investment returns to stockholders. Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments and total return figures are subject to change and, in the future, may be greater or less than the rates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Total return based on NAV is the change in ending NAV per share plus distributions per share paid during the period assuming participation in our dividend reinvestment plan divided by the beginning NAV per share for such period. Total return based on stock price is the change in the ending stock price of our common stock plus distributions paid during the period assuming participation in our dividend reinvestment plan divided by the beginning stock price of our common stock for such period.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our total return during the period based on the change in NAV plus distributions reinvested as of the respective distribution dates was 19.9% and our total return during the period based on the change in stock price plus distributions reinvested as of the respective distribution dates was 52.8%. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our total return during the period based on the change in NAV plus distributions reinvested as of the respective distribution dates was 14.2% and our total return during the period based on the change in stock price plus distributions reinvested as of the respective distribution dates was 7.7%.\nThe table below shows our return on average total assets and return on average NAV for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Returns on Net Asset Value and Total Assets\n(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,854 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in net assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,307 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average net asset value(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>407,195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>408,182 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average total assets(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>723,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>706,019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income to average net asset value </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in net assets to average net asset value </td> <td> </td> <td>18.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income to average total assets </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in net assets to average total assets </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> _______________\n(1)The average net asset values and the average total assets are computed based on daily balances.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates, including with respect to the valuation of our investments, could cause actual results to differ.\nUnderstanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management's judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We describe our most significant accounting policies in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming the estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. We have identified the valuation of our investment portfolio, including our investment valuation policy (which has been approved by the Board), as our critical accounting policy and estimates. The critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with the risks described under Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A.\nInvestment Valuation\nInvestment transactions are recorded on a trade-date basis. Our investments are carried at fair value in accordance with the 1940 Act and ASC Topic 946 and measured in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, or ASC Topic 820,\u201d issued by the FASB. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of the market's participant who holds the financial instrument rather than an entity-specific measure. When market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions are set to reflect those that the Adviser believes market participants would use in pricing the financial instruments on the measurement date.\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial instrument and is affected by a variety of factors. To the extent the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Our valuation methodology is approved by the Board, and the Board is responsible for the fair values determined. As markets change, new types of investments are made, or pricing for certain investments becomes more or less observable, management, with oversight from the Board, may refine our valuation methodologies to best reflect the fair value of our investments appropriately.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our investment portfolio, valued at fair value in accordance with our Board-approved valuation policy, represented approximately 93.3% of our total assets, as compared to approximately 92.7% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020.\nSee Note 4. Investments\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our valuation process.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSet forth below is a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. A discussion of our liquidity and capital resources as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 can be found within Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included in Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand, our available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility and our anticipated cash flows from operations, including from contractual monthly portfolio company payments and cash flows, prepayments, and the ability to liquidate publicly traded investments, will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations. This Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section should be read in conjunction with COVID-19 Developments\u201d above and Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCash Flows\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities, consisting primarily of purchases, sales and repayments of investments and the items described in Results of Operations,\u201d was $144.7 million, and net cash provided by financing activities was $159.1 million due primarily to the issuance of the 2026 Notes, and net borrowings under the Credit Facility of $82.0 million, partially offset by the redemption of the 2022 Notes and $45.6 million in distributions paid. As of December 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, was $59.1 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities, consisting primarily of purchases, sales and repayments of investments and the items described in Results of Operations,\u201d was $60.6 million, and net cash used in financing activities was $42.3 million due to net repayments under the Credit Facility of $144.3 million, $42.5 million in distributions paid, and $2.8 million of deferred Credit Facility costs, partially offset by net proceeds received from our January 2020 public follow-on offering of common stock and the issuance of the 2025 Notes in March 2020. As of December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, was $44.7 million.\nCapital Resources and Borrowings\nAs a BDC, we generally have an ongoing need to raise additional capital for investment purposes. As a result, we expect, from time to time, to access the debt and equity markets when we believe it is necessary and appropriate to do so. In this regard, we continue to explore various options for obtaining additional debt or equity capital for investments. This may include expanding or extending the Credit Facility or the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or debt securities. If we are unable to obtain leverage or raise equity capital on terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to grow our portfolio could be substantially impacted.\nCredit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $350 million in total commitments available under the Credit Facility, subject to various covenants and borrowing base requirements. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature, which allows us to increase the size of the Credit Facility to up to $400 million under certain circumstances. The revolving period under the Credit Facility expires on November 30, 2022, and the maturity date of the Credit Facility is May 31, 2024 (unless otherwise terminated earlier pursuant to its terms). Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the sum of (i) a floating rate based on certain indices, including LIBOR and commercial paper rates (subject to a floor of 0.50%), plus (ii) a margin of 2.80% if facility utilization is greater than or equal to 75%, 2.90% if utilization is greater than or equal to 50%, 3.00% if utilization is less than 50% and 4.5% during the amortization period. See Note 6. Borrowings\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the terms of the Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had outstanding borrowings of $200.0 million and $118.0 million, respectively, under the Credit Facility, excluding deferred credit facility costs of $2.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively, which is included in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. We had $150.0 million and $207.0 million of remaining capacity on our Credit Facility as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n2022 Notes\nOn July 14, 2017, we completed a public offering of $65.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes and received net proceeds of $62.8 million, after the payment of fees and offering costs. On July 24, 2017, as a result of the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase additional 2022 Notes, we issued an additional $9.75 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes and received net proceeds of $9.5 million, after the payment of fees and offering costs. The interest on the 2022 Notes accrued at an annual rate of 5.75%, payable quarterly.\nOn March 5, 2021, we notified the trustee under the indenture governing the 2022 Notes of our election to redeem, in full, the $74.75 million aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes outstanding, and instructed the trustee to provide notice of such redemption to the holders of the 2022 Notes in accordance with the terms of the indenture. On April 5, 2021, the entire $74.75 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Notes was redeemed in full in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the 2022 Notes. In connection with the redemption, the 2022 Notes were delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. The redemption was accounted for as a debt extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments, which resulted in a realized loss of $0.7 million. See Note 6. Borrowings\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the 2022 Notes.\n2025 Notes\nOn March 19, 2020, we completed a private offering of $70.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes and received net proceeds of $69.1 million, after the payment of fees and offering costs. The interest on the 2025 Notes, which accrues at an annual rate of 4.50%, is payable semiannually on March 19 and September 19 each year. The maturity date of the 2025 Notes is scheduled for March 19, 2025.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we have recorded in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities our liability for the 2025 Notes, net of deferred issuance costs, of $69.3 million and $69.1 million, respectively. See Note 6. Borrowings\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the 2025 Notes.\n2026 Notes\nOn March 1, 2021, we completed a private offering of $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes and received net proceeds of $197.9 million, after the payment of fees and offering costs. The interest on the 2026 Notes, which accrues at an annual rate of 4.50%, is payable semiannually on March 19 and September 19 each year, beginning on September 19, 2021. The maturity date of the 2026 Notes is scheduled for March 1, 2026.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have recorded in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities our liability for the 2026 Notes, net of deferred issuance costs, of $198.2 million. See Note 6. Borrowings\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the 2026 Notes.\nAdviser Revolver\nOn May 6, 2020, we entered into an unsecured revolving loan agreement (the Adviser Revolver\u201d) with the Adviser, which had a maximum credit limit of $50.0 million. The Adviser Revolver expired on December 31, 2020 without us having drawn or otherwise borrowed any amounts thereunder.\nAsset Coverage Requirements\nOn June 21, 2018, our stockholders voted at a special meeting of stockholders to approve a proposal to authorize us to be subject to a reduced asset coverage ratio of at least 150% under the 1940 Act. As a result of the stockholder approval at the special meeting, effective June 22, 2018, our applicable minimum asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act has been decreased to 150% from 200%. Thus, we are permitted under the 1940 Act, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. As of December 31, 2021, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts was 192%.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table shows a summary of our payment obligations for repayment of debt as of December 31, 2021:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments Due By Period\n(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>200,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>200,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2025 Notes </td> <td> </td> <td>70,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2026 Notes </td> <td> </td> <td>200,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>200,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>470,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>200,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>270,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSenior Securities\nInformation about our senior securities is shown in the following table as of each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, $91.8 million in unfunded commitments expired or were terminated.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our unfunded commitments to 16 companies totaled $132.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $160.7 million in unfunded commitments expired or were terminated.\nOur credit agreements contain customary lending provisions that allow us relief from funding obligations for previously made commitments in instances where the underlying portfolio company experiences material adverse events that affect the financial condition or business outlook for the portfolio company. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for us. We generally expect 50% - 75% of our gross unfunded commitments to eventually be drawn before the expiration of their corresponding availability periods.\nThe fair value at the inception of the delay draw credit agreements with our portfolio companies is equal to the fees and/or warrants received to enter into these agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the relevant counterparty's credit profile. The unfunded commitment liability reflects the fair value of these future funding commitments. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value for these unfunded commitments totaled $3.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively, and was included in other accrued expenses and liabilities\u201d in our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities.\nDistributions\nWe have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code. To maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute at least 90% of our net ordinary income and net realized short-term capital gains in excess of our net realized long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders. In order to avoid a non-deductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on certain of our undistributed income, we would need to distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: (a) 98% of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for such calendar year; (b) 98.2% of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year (unless an election is made by us to use our taxable year); and (c) certain undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. For the tax years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we were subject to a 4% U.S. federal excise tax and we may be subject to this tax in future years. In such cases, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.\nTo the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for the year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders. Our Adviser monitors available taxable earnings, including net investment income and realized capital gains, to determine if a return of capital may occur for the year. We estimate the source of our distributions as required by Section 19(a) of the 1940 Act to determine whether payment of dividends are expected to be paid from any other source other than net investment income accrued for the current period or certain cumulative periods, but we will not be able to determine whether any specific distribution will be treated as made out of our taxable earnings or as a return of capital until after the end of our taxable year. Any amount treated as a return of capital will reduce a stockholder's adjusted tax basis in his or her common stock, thereby increasing his or her potential gain or reducing his or her potential loss on the subsequent sale or other disposition of his or her common stock. On a quarterly basis, for any payment of dividends estimated to be paid from any other source other than net investment income accrued for the current period or certain cumulative periods based on the Section 19(a) requirement, we post a Section 19(a) notice through the Depository Trust Company's Legal Notice System and our website, as well as send our registered stockholders a printed copy of such notice along with the dividend payment. The estimates of the source of the distribution are interim estimates based on GAAP that are subject to revision, and the exact character of the distributions for tax purposes cannot be determined until the final books and records are finalized for the calendar year. Therefore, these estimates are made solely in order to comply with the requirements of Section 19(a) of the 1940 Act and should not be relied upon for tax reporting or any other purposes and could differ significantly from the actual character of distributions for tax purposes.\nThe following table shows our cash distributions per share that have been authorized by our Board since our initial public offering to December 31, 2021. From March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2015, and during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, distributions represent ordinary income as our earnings exceeded distributions. Approximately $0.24 per share of the distributions during the year ended December 31, 2016 represented a return of capital. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, distributions represent ordinary income and long term capital gains. Depending on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the extent of its impact on our portfolio companies' operations and our net investment income, any future distributions to our stockholders may be for amounts less than our historical distributions, may be made less frequently than historical practices, and may be made in part cash and part stock (as per each stockholder's election), subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20% of the aggregate declared distribution.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

pricing of our initial public offering on March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations), through March 31, 2014.\n(2)Represents a special distribution.\n(3)Includes approximately $0.16 per share sourced from long-term capital gains. The Company initially estimated that the December 15, 2021 dividend payment had been sourced in part from long-term capital gains and that no portion of the September 15, 2021 dividend had been sourced from long-term capital gains. However, upon subsequent review, the Company has determined that the entirety of the December 15, 2021 dividend was sourced from ordinary income and that approximately $0.16 per share of the September 15, 2021 dividend was sourced from long-term capital gains.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, distributions paid were comprised of interest-sourced distributions (qualified interest income) in an amount equal to 68.2% of total distributions paid. As of December 31, 2021, we estimated that we had undistributed taxable earnings from net investment income (or Spillover Income\u201d) of $12.4 million, or $0.40 per share.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) ( ASU 2021-01\u201d). ASU 2021-01 is an update of ASU 2020-04, which is in response to concerns about structural risks of interbank offered rates, and particularly the risk of cessation of LIBOR; regulators have undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify alternative reference rates that are more observable or transaction based and less susceptible to manipulation. ASU 2020-04 provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. ASU 2020-04 is elective and applies to all entities, subject to meeting certain criteria, that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The ASU 2021-01 update clarifies that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. The amendments in this update are effective immediately through December 31, 2022, for all entities. The adoption of these rules did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Developments\nDistribution\nOn February 22, 2022, the Board declared a $0.36 per share regular quarterly distribution, payable on March 31, 2022 to stockholders of record on March 15, 2022.\nRecent Portfolio Activity\nFrom January 1, 2022 through March 1, 2022, we closed $27.7 million of additional debt commitments and funded $10.2 million in new investments. TPC's direct originations platform entered into $432.3 million of additional non-binding signed term sheets with venture growth stage companies. These investment opportunities for us are subject to due diligence, definitive documentation and investment committee approval, as well as compliance with TPC's allocation policy. From January 1, 2022 through March 1, 2022, we received $89.0 million of principal prepayments, which included principal prepayments from Casper Sleep Inc., Sonder Holdings Inc. and Virtual Instruments Corporation, generating over $3.0 million of accelerated income.\nIssuance of 5.00% Series 2022A Senior Notes Due 2027\nOn February 28, 2022, we issued $125,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of our 5.00% Series 2022A Senior Notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes\u201d). The 2027 Notes were issued in a private placement to certain qualified institutional investors, pursuant to the terms of the Second Supplement, dated as of February 28, 2022 (the Second Supplement\u201d), to the Note Purchase Agreement. The 2027 Notes bear a fixed interest rate of 5.00% per year and will mature on February 28, 2027, unless redeemed, purchased or prepaid by us prior to such date in accordance with their terms. In the event that a Below Investment Grade Event (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) occurs, the 2027 Notes will bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.00% per year from the date of the occurrence of the Below Investment Grade Event to and until the date on which the Below Investment Grade Event is no longer continuing.\nInterest on the 2027 Notes will be due semiannually on February 28 and August 28 each year, beginning on August 28, 2022. The 2027 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option at par plus accrued interest to the prepayment date and, if applicable, a make-whole premium. In addition, we are obligated to offer to prepay the 2027 Notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the date of prepayment, if certain change in control events occur. The 2027 Notes are our general unsecured obligations that rank pari passu with all outstanding and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness issued by us; provided, however, in the event that we create, incur, assume or permit to exist liens on or with respect to any of our property or assets in connection with future secured indebtedness of more than an aggregate principal amount of $25 million, the 2027 Notes, the 2026 Notes and the 2025 Notes will generally become secured concurrently therewith, equally and ratably with such indebtedness. The other terms and conditions applicable to the 2027 Notes under the Note Purchase Agreement, as modified by the Second Supplement, including events of default and affirmative and negative covenants, are substantially similar to the terms and conditions applicable to the 2026 Notes and the 2025 Notes.\nThe 2027 Notes were offered in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of Securities Act. The 2027 Notes have not and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act, as applicable.", "summary": "The report discusses the forward-looking statements, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company and its portfolio companies, and its investment objectives.

and\n\u2022the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify in Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A, and in our other filings with the SEC that we make from time to time.\nAlthough we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include, without limitation, our ability to originate new loans and investments, borrowing costs and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our shares are currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE\u201d) under the symbol TPVG\u201d.\nWe were formed to expand the venture growth stage business segment of TPC's investment platform. TPC is widely recognized as a leading global financing provider devoted to serving venture capital-backed companies with creative, flexible and customized debt financing, equity capital and complementary services throughout their lifespan. TPC is located on Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley and has a primary focus in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries.\nOur investment objective is to maximize our total return to stockholders primarily in the form of current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by lending primarily with warrants to venture growth stage companies focused in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries backed by TPC's select group of leading venture capital investors.\nCOVID-19 Developments\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and the related effect on the U.S. and global economies, including the recent economic downturn and the uncertainty associated with the timing and likelihood of economic recovery, has had adverse consequences for the business operations of some of our portfolio companies and has adversely affected, and threatens to continue to adversely affect, our operations and the operations of the Adviser.\nWhile we have been monitoring, and continue to monitor, the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our and our portfolio companies' business, we have continued to raise capital, maintain appropriate levels of available liquidity, support and monitor our existing portfolio companies, fund existing unfunded commitments, and selectively deploy capital in new investment opportunities in venture capital-backed companies.\nWe have seen, and may continue to see, certain of our portfolio companies experience financial distress and, depending on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the extent of its disruption to operations, believe that there is an increased risk of certain of our portfolio companies defaulting on their financial obligations to us and their other capital providers. In addition, as a result of the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related disruption and financial distress, certain portfolio companies may seek to modify their loans from us, which could reduce the amount or extend the time for payment of principal, reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest, and/or increase the amount of PIK interest we receive with respect to such investment, among other things. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have also impeded, and may continue to impede, the ability of certain of our portfolio companies to raise additional capital and/or pursue asset sales or otherwise execute strategic transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on the valuation of our investments in such companies. Portfolio companies operating in certain industries may be more susceptible to these risks than other portfolio companies in other industries in light of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of our portfolio companies previously took steps to significantly reduce, modify, or alter business strategies and operations, and additional portfolio companies may take similar steps if subjected to prolonged and severe financial distress, which may impair their business on a permanent basis. In addition, as a result of the ongoing adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that future equity rounds completed by our portfolio companies will be at levels greater than or equal to previous rounds, which may result in net unrealized depreciation on our warrant and equity portfolio in future periods.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had one portfolio company in which our investment was on non-accrual status (which was generally caused by events unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic), with an aggregate cost and fair value of $29.5 million and $11.3 million, respectively. The various effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those discussed above, increase the risk that we will place additional investments on non-accrual status in the future. Any significant increase in aggregate unrealized depreciation of our investment portfolio or significant reductions in our net asset value as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise increases the risk of failing to meet the 1940 Act asset coverage requirements and breaching covenants under the Credit Facility, or under the governing agreements for the 2025 Notes and the 2026 Notes, or otherwise triggering an event of default under our borrowing arrangements. Any such breach of covenant or event of default, if we are not able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders or debt holders, would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. See Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A for more information. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act and with our covenants under the Credit Facility and under the governing agreements for the 2025 Notes and the 2026 Notes.\nWe will continue to monitor the evolving situation relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and related guidance from U.S. and international authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities. Given the dynamic nature of this situation and the fact that there may be developments outside of our control that require us or our portfolio companies to adjust plans of operation, we cannot reasonably estimate the full impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future. However, it could have a material adverse impact for a prolonged period of time on our future net investment income, particularly with respect to our interest income, the fair value of our portfolio investments, and the results of operations and financial condition of us and our portfolio companies. See Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A, and in our other filings with the SEC that we make from time to time, for more information.\nPortfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Asset Quality\nPortfolio Composition\nWe originate and invest primarily in venture growth stage companies. Companies at the venture growth stage have distinct characteristics differentiating them from venture capital-backed companies at other stages in their development lifecycle. We invest primarily in (i) growth capital loans that have a secured collateral position and that are generally used by venture growth stage companies to finance their continued expansion and growth, (ii) equipment financings, which may be structured as loans or leases, that have a secured collateral position on specified mission-critical equipment, (iii) on a select basis, revolving loans that have a secured collateral position and that are typically used by venture growth stage companies to advance against inventory, components, accounts receivable, contractual or future billings, bookings, revenues, sales or cash payments and collections including proceeds from a sale, financing or the equivalent and (iv) direct equity investments in venture growth stage companies. In connection with our growth capital loans, equipment financings and revolving loans, we generally receive warrant investments as part of the transaction that allow us to participate in any equity appreciation of our borrowers and enhance our overall investment returns.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 246 investments in 91 companies. Our investments included 107 debt investments, 92 warrant investments, and 47 direct equity and related investments. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate cost and fair value of these investments were $837.8 million and $865.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, 10 of our portfolio companies were publicly traded. As of December 31, 2021, the 107 debt investments had an aggregate fair value of $757.2 million and a weighted average loan to enterprise value ratio at the time of underwriting of 7.7%. Enterprise value of a portfolio company is estimated based on information available, including any information regarding the most recent rounds of equity funding, at the time of origination.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 195 investments in 69 companies. Our investments included 94 debt investments, 75 warrant investments, and 26 direct equity and related investments. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate cost and fair value of these investments were $662.4 million and $633.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, one of our portfolio companies was publicly traded. As of December 31, 2020, the 94 debt investments had an aggregate fair value of $583.3 million and a weighted average loan to enterprise value ratio at the time of underwriting of 8.9%. Enterprise value of a portfolio company is estimated based on information available, including any information regarding the most recent rounds of equity funding, at the time of origination.\nThe following tables show information on the cost and fair value of our investments in companies along with the number of companies in our portfolio as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\n_______________\n(1)Represents non-duplicative number of companies.\n _______________\n(1)Represents non-duplicative number of companies.\nThe following tables show the fair value of the portfolio of investments, by industry and the percentage of the total investment portfolio, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n _______________\n*Amount represents less than 0.05% of the total portfolio investments.\n\n_______________\n*Amount represents less than 0.05% of the total portfolio investments.\nThe following table shows the financing product type of our debt investments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\nGrowth capital loans in which the borrower held a term loan facility, with or without an accompanying revolving loan, in priority to our senior lien represent 26.2% and 30.6% of our debt investments at fair value as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nInvestment Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we entered into commitments with 27 new portfolio companies and seven existing portfolio companies totaling $541.5 million, funded debt investments to 39 portfolio companies for $411.0 million in principal value, acquired warrant investments representing $8.5 million of value, and made equity investments of $5.2 million. Debt investments funded during the year ended December 31, 2021 carried a weighted average annualized portfolio yield of 13.5% at origination.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we entered into commitments with 11 new portfolio companies and 12 existing portfolio companies totaling $276.7 million, funded debt investments to 24 portfolio companies for $204.6 million in principal value, acquired warrant investments representing $3.8 million of value, and made equity investments of $2.3 million and sold equity in two portfolio companies for $29.9 million. Debt investments funded during the year ended December 31, 2020 carried a weighted average annualized portfolio yield of 13.5% at origination.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we received $160.9 million of principal prepayments and $61.9 million of scheduled principal amortization.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we received $138.1 million of principal prepayments, $17.0 million of early repayments, and $48.3 million of scheduled principal amortization.\nThe following table shows the total portfolio investment activity for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

TPC is located on Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley and has a primary focus in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries.\nOur investment objective is to maximize our total return to stockholders primarily in the form of current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by lending primarily with warrants to venture growth stage companies focused in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries backed by TPC's select group of leading venture capital investors.\nCOVID-19 Developments\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and the related effect on the U.S. and global economies, including the recent economic downturn and the uncertainty associated with the timing and likelihood of economic recovery, has had adverse consequences for the business operations of some of our portfolio companies and has adversely affected, and threatens to continue to adversely affect, our operations and the operations of the Adviser.\nWhile we have been monitoring, and continue to monitor, the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our and our portfolio companies' business, we have continued to raise capital, maintain appropriate levels of available liquidity, support and monitor our existing portfolio companies, fund existing unfunded commitments, and selectively deploy capital in new investment opportunities in venture capital-backed companies.\nWe have seen, and may continue to see, certain of our portfolio companies experience financial distress and, depending on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the extent of its disruption to operations, believe that there is an increased risk of certain of our portfolio companies defaulting on their financial obligations to us and their other capital providers. In addition, as a result of the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related disruption and financial distress, certain portfolio companies may seek to modify their loans from us, which could reduce the amount or extend the time for payment of principal, reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest, and/or increase the amount of PIK interest we receive with respect to such investment, among other things. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have also impeded, and may continue to impede, the ability of certain of our portfolio companies to raise additional capital and/or pursue asset sales or otherwise execute strategic transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on the valuation of our investments in such companies. Portfolio companies operating in certain industries may be more susceptible to these risks than other portfolio companies in other industries in light of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of our portfolio companies previously took steps to significantly reduce, modify, or alter business strategies and operations, and additional portfolio companies may take similar steps if subjected to prolonged and severe financial distress, which may impair their business on a permanent basis. In addition, as a result of the ongoing adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that future equity rounds completed by our portfolio companies will be at levels greater than or equal to previous rounds, which may result in net unrealized depreciation on our warrant and equity portfolio in future periods.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had one portfolio company in which our investment was on non-accrual status (which was generally caused by events unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic), with an aggregate cost and fair value of $29.5 million and $11.3 million, respectively. The various effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those discussed above, increase the risk that we will place additional investments on non-accrual status in the future. Any significant increase in aggregate unrealized depreciation of our investment portfolio or significant reductions in our net asset value as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise increases the risk of failing to meet the 1940 Act asset coverage requirements and breaching covenants under the Credit Facility, or under the governing agreements for the 2025 Notes and the 2026 Notes, or otherwise triggering an event of default under our borrowing arrangements. Any such breach of covenant or event of default, if we are not able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders or debt holders, would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. See Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A for more information. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act and with our covenants under the Credit Facility and under the governing agreements for the 2025 Notes and the 2026 Notes.\nWe will continue to monitor the evolving situation relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and related guidance from U.S. and international authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities. Given the dynamic nature of this situation and the fact that there may be developments outside of our control that require us or our portfolio companies to adjust plans of operation, we cannot reasonably estimate the full impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future. However, it could have a material adverse impact for a prolonged period of time on our future net investment income, particularly with respect to our interest income, the fair value of our portfolio investments, and the results of operations and financial condition of us and our portfolio companies. See Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A, and in our other filings with the SEC that we make from time to time, for more information.\nPortfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Asset Quality\nPortfolio Composition\nWe originate and invest primarily in venture growth stage companies. Companies at the venture growth stage have distinct characteristics differentiating them from venture capital-backed companies at other stages in their development lifecycle. We invest primarily in (i) growth capital loans that have a secured collateral position and that are generally used by venture growth stage companies to finance their continued expansion and growth, (ii) equipment financings, which may be structured as loans or leases, that have a secured collateral position on specified mission-critical equipment, (iii) on a select basis, revolving loans that have a secured collateral position and that are typically used by venture growth stage companies to advance against inventory, components, accounts receivable, contractual or future billings, bookings, revenues, sales or cash payments and collections including proceeds from a sale, financing or the equivalent and (iv) direct equity investments in venture growth stage companies. In connection with our growth capital loans, equipment financings and revolving loans, we generally receive warrant investments as part of the transaction that allow us to participate in any equity appreciation of our borrowers and enhance our overall investment returns.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 246 investments in 91 companies. Our investments included 107 debt investments, 92 warrant investments, and 47 direct equity and related investments. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate cost and fair value of these investments were $837.8 million and $865.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, 10 of our portfolio companies were publicly traded. As of December 31, 2021, the 107 debt investments had an aggregate fair value of $757.2 million and a weighted average loan to enterprise value ratio at the time of underwriting of 7.7%. Enterprise value of a portfolio company is estimated based on information available, including any information regarding the most recent rounds of equity funding, at the time of origination.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 195 investments in 69 companies. Our investments included 94 debt investments, 75 warrant investments, and 26 direct equity and related investments. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate cost and fair value of these investments were $662.4 million and $633.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, one of our portfolio companies was publicly traded. As of December 31, 2020, the 94 debt investments had an aggregate fair value of $583.3 million and a weighted average loan to enterprise value ratio at the time of underwriting of 8.9%. Enterprise value of a portfolio company is estimated based on information available, including any information regarding the most recent rounds of equity funding, at the time of origination.\nThe following tables show information on the cost and fair value of our investments in companies along with the number of companies in our portfolio as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments by Type\n(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Cost </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Unrealized Gains (losses) </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of\nInvestments </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of\nCompanies </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt investments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>774,652 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>757,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17,430) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warrant investments </td> <td> </td> <td>25,597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,159 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity investments </td> <td> </td> <td>37,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,762 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Investments in Portfolio Companies </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>837,849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>865,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n(1)Represents non-duplicative number of companies.\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments by Type\n(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Cost </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Unrealized Gains (losses) </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of\nInvestments </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of\nCompanies </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt investments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>613,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>583,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(30,010) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warrant investments </td> <td> </td> <td>20,525 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,231 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,706 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity investments </td> <td> </td> <td>28,553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,340) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Investments in Portfolio Companies </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>662,423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>633,779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(28,644) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td> </td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n</table> _______________\n(1)Represents non-duplicative number of companies.\nThe following tables show the fair value of the portfolio of investments, by industry and the percentage of the total investment portfolio, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments in Portfolio Companies by Industry\n(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>At Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of Total Investments </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business Applications Software </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>114,109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>E-Commerce -
