MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of several immunotherapy technologies and other cancer-targeting biologics. Our drug candidates, including antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates and other protein-based therapeutics, are derived from a broad set of complementary technologies which have the ability to engage the human immune system and/or directly inhibit tumors to treat specific types of cancer or other diseases.\nOur latest stage drug candidate, glembatumumab vedotin (also referred to as CDX-011) is a targeted antibody-drug conjugate in a randomized, Phase 2b study for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer and a Phase 2 study for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Varlilumab (also referred to as CDX-1127) is an immune modulating antibody that is designed to enhance a patient's immune response against cancer. We established proof of principle in a Phase 1 study with varlilumab, which supported the initiation of combination studies in various indications. CDX-3379, a human monoclonal antibody designed to block the activity of ErbB3 (HER3), is in Phase 2 development in combination with cetuximab for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. We also have a number of earlier stage drug candidates in clinical development, including CDX-014, an antibody-drug conjugate targeting renal and ovarian cancers; CDX-1140, a human monoclonal antibody targeted to CD40, a key activator of immune response; CDX-301, an immune cell mobilizing agent and dendritic cell growth factor; and CDX-1401, a targeted immunotherapeutic aimed at antigen presenting cells, or APCs, for cancer indications. Our drug candidates address market opportunities for which we believe current therapies are inadequate or non-existent.\nWe are building a fully integrated, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops important therapies for patients with unmet medical needs. Our program assets provide us with the strategic options to either retain full economic rights to our innovative therapies or seek favorable economic terms through advantageous commercial partnerships. This approach allows us to maximize the overall value of our technology and product portfolio while best ensuring the expeditious development of each individual product.\nThe following table reflects Celldex-sponsored clinical studies that we are actively pursuing at this time. All programs are currently fully owned by Celldex.\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Product (generic)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Indication/Field </th> <th> </th> <th>Status </th> <th> </th> <th>Sponsor </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Glembatumumab vedotin\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Triple negative breast cancer </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 2b </td> <td> </td> <td>Celldex </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Glembatumumab vedotin\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Metastatic melanoma (single-agent, with varlilumab or CPI(1) or CDX-301) </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>Celldex </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Varlilumab\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Multiple solid tumors (with Opdivo\u00ae) </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>Celldex(2) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CDX-3379\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Head and neck squamous cell cancer (with Erbitux\u00ae) </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>Celldex </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CDX-014\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Renal cell and ovarian carcinomas </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>Celldex </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CDX-1140\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Multiple solid tumors </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>Celldex </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)checkpoint inhibitor;\n(2)BMS collaboration\nWe also routinely work with external parties, such as government agencies, to collaboratively advance our drug candidates. The following pipeline reflects clinical trials of our drug candidates being actively pursued by outside organizations. In addition to the studies listed below, we also have an\nInvestigator Initiated Research (IIR) program with six studies ongoing with our drug candidates and additional studies currently under consideration.\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Product (generic)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Indication/Field </th> <th> </th> <th>Status </th> <th> </th> <th>Sponsor </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Glembatumumab vedotin </td> <td> </td> <td>Uveal melanoma </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>NCI (CRADA) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Glembatumumab vedotin </td> <td> </td> <td>Squamous cell lung cancer </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>PrECOG, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>CDX-1401/CDX-301 </td> <td> </td> <td>Malignant melanoma </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>NCI (CRADA) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>CDX-1401/Tecentriq\u00ae/SGI-110 </td> <td> </td> <td>Ovarian cancer </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>NCI (CRADA) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Varlilumab/Opdivo\u00ae </td> <td> </td> <td>B-cell malignancies </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>NCI (CRADA) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties. Completion of clinical trials may take several years or more, and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a drug candidate. It is not unusual for the clinical development of these types of drug candidates to each take five years or more, and for total development costs to exceed $100 million for each drug candidate. We estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following timelines:\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Clinical Phase\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Estimated\nCompletion\nPeriod </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Phase 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 2 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Phase 2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Phase 3\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 5 Years </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022 the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial;\n\u2022 the duration of patient follow-up that seems appropriate in view of results;\n\u2022 the number of clinical sites included in the trials;\n\u2022 the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects; and\n\u2022 the efficacy and safety profile of the drug candidate.\nWe test potential drug candidates in numerous preclinical studies for safety, toxicology and immunogenicity. We may then conduct multiple clinical trials for each drug candidate. As we obtain results from trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain drug candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising drug candidates.\nAn element of our business strategy is to pursue the research and development of a broad portfolio of drug candidates. This is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures. To the extent we are unable to maintain a broad range of drug candidates, our dependence on the success of one or a few drug candidates increases.\nRegulatory approval is required before we can market our drug candidates as therapeutic products. In order to proceed to subsequent clinical trial stages and to ultimately achieve regulatory approval, the regulatory agency must conclude that our clinical data are safe and effective. Historically, the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials (through Phase 2) have often not been predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials. A number of new drugs and biologics have shown promising results in early clinical trials but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals.\nFurthermore, our business strategy includes the option of entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our drug candidates. In the event that third parties take over the clinical trial process for one of our drug candidates, the estimated completion date would largely be under control of that third party rather than us. We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products, if any, will be subject to future collaborative arrangements, in whole or in part, and how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements. Our programs may also benefit from subsidies, grants, contracts or government or agency-sponsored studies that could reduce our development costs.\nAs a result of the uncertainties discussed above, among others, it is difficult to accurately estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when, if ever, and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product. Our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements, when appropriate, could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity. These uncertainties could force us to seek additional, external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy. Our inability to raise additional capital, or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us, would jeopardize the future success of our business.\nDuring the past five years through December 31, 2017, we incurred an aggregate of $470.9 million in research and development expenses. The following table indicates the amount incurred for each of our significant research programs and for other identified research and development activities during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The amounts disclosed in the following table reflect direct research and development costs, license fees associated with the underlying technology and an allocation of indirect research and development costs to each program.\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(In thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Glembatumumab vedotin\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>36,873 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>30,156 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>19,124 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Varlilumab\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,940 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,484 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CDX-3379\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CDX-014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,534 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,724 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CDX-1140\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,909 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CDX-1401\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,385 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CDX-301\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,053 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,206 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Anti-KIT Program\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TAM\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>438 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rintega\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,038 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Programs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,265 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,210 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total R&D Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>96,171 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>102,726 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>100,171 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nClinical Development Programs\nGlembatumumab Vedotin\nGlembatumumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, that consists of a fully human monoclonal antibody, CR011, linked to a potent cell-killing drug, monomethyl auristatin E, or MMAE. The CR011 antibody specifically targets glycoprotein NMB, referred to as gpNMB, that is over-expressed in a variety of cancers including breast cancer, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, uveal melanoma and osteosarcoma, among others. The ADC technology, comprised of MMAE and a stable linker system for attaching it to CR011, was licensed from Seattle Genetics, Inc. and is the same\nas that used in the marketed product Adcetris\u00ae. The ADC is designed to be stable in the bloodstream. Following intravenous administration, glembatumumab vedotin targets and binds to gpNMB, and upon internalization into the targeted cell, glembatumumab vedotin is designed to release MMAE from CR011 to produce a cell-killing effect. Glembatumumab vedotin is being studied across multiple indications in company-sponsored trials and in collaborative studies with external parties. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has granted fast track designation to glembatumumab vedotin for the treatment of advanced, refractory/resistant gpNMB-expressing breast cancer. A companion diagnostic is in development for certain indications, and we expect that, if necessary, such a companion diagnostic must be approved by the FDA or certain other foreign regulatory agencies before glembatumumab vedotin may be commercialized in those indications.\nTreatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer: Glembatumumab vedotin has been evaluated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in multiple studies including a single-arm Phase 1/2 study (Journal of Clinical Oncology, September 2014); a randomized, controlled Phase 2b study compared to Investigator's Choice chemotherapy in patients with gpNMB-positive MBC called EMERGE (Journal of Clinical Oncology, April 2015); and the ongoing randomized, controlled Phase 2b study in patients with triple negative, gpNMB overexpressing breast cancer, called METRIC. We expect to report topline primary endpoint data from the METRIC study during the second quarter of 2018.\nThe most recent data presented for glembatumumab vedotin in breast cancer are from the EMERGE study, the randomized, multi-center Phase 2b study in 124 patients with heavily pre-treated, advanced, gpNMB-positive breast cancer. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either glembatumumab vedotin or single-agent Investigator's Choice chemotherapy. Patients randomized to receive Investigator's Choice were allowed to cross over to receive glembatumumab vedotin following disease progression. Activity endpoints included response rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The final study results, as shown below, suggested that glembatumumab vedotin induced significant response rates compared to currently available therapies in patient subsets with advanced, refractory breast cancers with high gpNMB expression (expression in at least 25% of tumor cells) and in patients with triple negative breast cancer. The OS and PFS of patients treated with glembatumumab vedotin were also observed to be greatest in patients with high gpNMB expression and, in particular, in patients with triple negative breast cancer who also had high gpNMB expression. Adverse events prominent with the glembatumumab vedotin arm included rash and peripheral neuropathy, while hematologic toxicity was more frequent and severe in the Investigator's Choice arm.\nEMERGE: Overall Response Rate and Disease Control Data (Intent-to-Treat Population)\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>High gpNMB Expression </th> <th> </th> <th>Triple Negative\nand gpNMB\nOver-Expression </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Glembatumumab\nVedotin </th> <th> </th> <th>Investigator's\nChoice </th> <th> </th> <th>Glembatumumab\nVedotin </th> <th> </th> <th>Investigator's\nChoice </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(n=23) </th> <th> </th> <th>(n=11) </th> <th> </th> <th>(n=10) </th> <th> </th> <th>(n=6) </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Response Rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Disease Control Rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTumor response assessed by RECIST 1.1, inclusive of response observed at a single time point.\nEMERGE: Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) Data\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>High gpNMB Expression </th> <th> </th> <th>Triple Negative\nand gpNMB\nOver-Expression </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Glembatumumab\nVedotin </th> <th> </th> <th>Investigator's\nChoice </th> <th> </th> <th>Glembatumumab\nVedotin </th> <th> </th> <th>Investigator's\nChoice </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMedian PFS (months)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>p=0.18 </td> <td> </td> <td>p=0.0017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Median OS (months)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 10.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n5.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> 10.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n5.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>p=0.31 </td> <td> </td> <td>p=0.003\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn December 2013, we initiated METRIC, a randomized, controlled (2:1) Phase 2b study of glembatumumab vedotin versus Xeloda\u00ae in patients with triple negative breast cancer that over-expresses gpNMB. Clinical trial study sites were opened to enrollment across the U.S., Canada, Australia and the European Union. The METRIC protocol was amended in late 2014 based on feedback from clinical investigators conducting the study that the eligibility criteria for study entry were limiting their ability to enroll patients they felt were clinically appropriate. In addition, we had spoken to country-specific members of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and believed an opportunity existed to expand the study into the EU. The amendment expanded patient entry criteria to position it for the possibility of full marketing approval with global regulators, including the EMA, and to support improved enrollment in the study. The primary endpoint of the study is PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the earlier of disease progression or death due to any cause. PFS is an established endpoint for full approval registration studies in this patient population in both the U.S. and the EU. The sample size (n=300) and the secondary endpoint of OS remained unchanged. Since implementation of these changes, both the FDA and central European regulatory authorities have reviewed the protocol design, and we believe the METRIC study could potentially support marketing approval in both the U.S. and Europe dependent upon data results and review.\nEnrollment (n=327) in METRIC was completed in August 2017. The study calls for 203 progression events for evaluation of the primary endpoint, which will be assessed based on an independent, central reading of patient scans. The sum of the data, including the secondary endpoints of response rate, OS, DOR and safety, will be important in assessing clinical benefit. Based on the current rate of progression events in the study, the Company projects that topline primary endpoint data should be available in the second quarter of 2018.\nEfforts to ensure delivery of manufactured drug that is ready for commercialization and a companion diagnostic are underway. While we have made and continue to make progress on these fronts, we have made the decision to stage some of the more costly work in these areas to begin after we have received results from the study. While this step will extend the timeline to complete our regulatory submissions, we believe this is the most prudent use of our funds as we seek to advance our pipeline overall. Assuming positive data, we plan to work with the FDA on a regulatory strategy that would support submitting a Biologics License Application (BLA) in the second half of 2019.\nTreatment of Metastatic Melanoma: Glembatumumab vedotin has been evaluated for the treatment of unresectable stage III or IV metastatic melanoma in two studies including a single-arm Phase 1/2 open-label study and an ongoing multi-cohort Phase 2 study. Results from the Phase 1/2 study were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in September 2014.\nThe most recent data for glembatumumab vedotin in metastatic melanoma are from the ongoing Phase 2 study. This study currently includes four single arm cohorts: (1) a single-agent cohort (enrollment completed; data presented at ASCO 2017), (2) a combination cohort with varlilumab (enrollment completed; data presented at SITC 2017), (3) a combination cohort with an approved\ncheckpoint inhibitor (i.e., Opdivo\u00ae or Keytruda\u00ae) following progression on the checkpoint inhibitor alone (enrollment completed; follow-up continues), and (4) a combination cohort with CDX-301 (enrollment ongoing).\nThe primary endpoint for each cohort is ORR, except the fourth cohort which is assessing safety and tolerability in anticipation of additional combinations. Secondary endpoints include analyses of PFS, DOR, OS, retrospective investigation of whether the anticancer activity of glembatumumab vedotin is dependent upon the degree of gpNMB expression in tumor tissue and safety of both the monotherapy and combination regimens.\nWe presented mature data from the single-agent cohort in an oral presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June 2017. The cohort enrolled 62 evaluable patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma. All patients had been heavily pre-treated (median prior therapies = 3; range 1-8) and had progressed during or after checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and almost all patients had received both ipilimumab (n=58; 94%) and anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 (n=58; 94%) therapy. Twelve patients presented with BRAF mutation, and fifteen had prior treatment with BRAF or BRAF/MEK targeted agents. Median OS for all patients was 9.0 months (95% CI: 6.1, 13.0). The primary endpoint of the cohort (threshold of 6 or more objective responses in 52 evaluable patients) was exceeded. 7 of 62 (11%) patients experienced a confirmed response. One patient experienced a complete response (CR), and six patients experienced partial responses (PR). An additional three patients also experienced single timepoint PRs. The median DOR was 6.0 months. A 52% disease control rate (patients without progression for greater than three months) was demonstrated, and median PFS for all patients was 4.4 months. Consistent with previous studies in melanoma and breast cancer, early development of rash was associated with greater clinical benefit, including more prolonged PFS and OS. The safety profile was consistent with prior studies of glembatumumab vedotin with rash, neutropenia and neuropathy experienced as the most significant adverse events. Pre-treatment tumor tissue was available for 59 patients. All samples were gpNMB positive, and 78% of patients had tumors with 100% of their epithelial cells expressing gpNMB. Given both the high level of expression and the intensity of expression across this patient population, identifying a potential population for gpNMB enrichment is not feasible; therefore, all patients with metastatic melanoma could be evaluated as potential candidates for treatment with glembatumumab vedotin in future studies.\nData from the second cohort, combining glembatumumab vedotin and varlilumab, were presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer's (SITC) 32nd Annual Meeting in November 2017. The cohort enrolled 34 patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma. All patients had been heavily pre-treated (median prior therapies = 3; range 1-8) and had progressed during or after checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy (median prior CPI therapies = 2; range 1-4). Almost all patients had received ipilimumab (n=26; 76%) and/or anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 (n=34; 100%) therapy. Nine patients presented with BRAF mutation, and eleven had prior treatment with BRAF or BRAF/MEK targeted agents. Median PFS for all patients was 2.6 months (95% CI: 1.4, 2.8), and median OS for all patients was 6.4 months (95% CI: 3.2, 8.3). One of 31 patients eligible for response evaluation experienced a confirmed partial response (3%), and an additional two patients also experienced single timepoint partial responses. 52% of patients experienced stable disease (minimum of six or more weeks). A 19% disease control rate (patients without progression for greater than three months) was demonstrated. The safety profile was consistent with prior studies of glembatumumab vedotin, and there was no evidence of additive toxicity associated with the combination. Biological effects of varlilumab were consistent with prior observations and did not appear to be impacted by the addition of an ADC. Modest clinical benefit in the combination could be due to multiple factors, including potential lack of sensitivity to immunotherapy in patients with checkpoint refractory disease, many of whom progressed so rapidly that they experienced a very short duration of varlilumab treatment (median 2 doses); a possible dearth of antigen presenting cells in tumors; and the potential for immune checkpoint molecules to remain unblocked without checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Future cohorts are designed to\naddress some of these potential factors. No significant correlation between rash and outcome was observed but will continue to be monitored in future cohorts.\nTreatment of Other Indications: We have entered into a collaborative relationship with PrECOG, LLC, which represents a research network established by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), under which PrECOG, LLC, is conducting an open-label Phase 1/2 study in patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV, gpNMB-expressing, advanced or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung, who have progressed on prior platinum-based chemotherapy. This study opened to enrollment in April 2016 and is ongoing. The study includes a dose-escalation phase followed by a two-stage Phase 2 portion (Simon two-stage design). The Phase 1, dose-escalation portion of the study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of glembatumumab vedotin at varying dose levels. The first stage of the Phase 2 portion plans to enroll approximately 20 patients, and if at least two patients achieve a partial response or complete response, a second stage may enroll an additional 15 patients. The primary objective of the Phase 2 portion of the study is to assess the anti-tumor activity of glembatumumab vedotin in squamous cell lung cancer as measured by ORR. Secondary objectives of the study include analyses of safety and tolerability and further assessment of anti-tumor activity across a broad range of endpoints.\nWe have also entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, with the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, under which NCI is sponsoring a Phase 2 study of glembatumumab vedotin in uveal melanoma. The study is a single-arm, open-label study in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic uveal melanoma. The study has a two-stage design with a pre-specified activity threshold necessary in the first stage to progress enrollment to the second stage. The primary outcome measure is ORR. Secondary outcome measures include change in gpNMB expression on tumor tissue via immunohistochemistry, safety, OS and PFS. Data from this study were presented at the 9th World Congress of Melanoma in October 2017. Two (6%) objective responses were observed in 31 patients to date, and 35% of patients experienced stable disease greater than 100 days (median 5.5 months). The disease control rate (response rate + stable disease) for all patients on study was noteworthy at 61%. Median PFS was 3.2 months, and median OS was 11.8 months. For patients who experienced either a partial response or stable disease, median PFS was 5.5 months, and median OS had not yet been reached. The NCI is conducting exploratory immune correlates to provide insight into target saturation, antigen release and potential combination strategies.\nVarlilumab\nVarlilumab is a fully human monoclonal agonist antibody that binds to and activates CD27, a critical co-stimulatory molecule in the immune activation cascade. We believe varlilumab works primarily by stimulating T cells, an important component of a person's immune system, to attack cancer cells. Restricted expression and regulation of CD27 enables varlilumab specifically to activate T cells, resulting in an enhanced immune response with the potential for a favorable safety profile. In preclinical studies, varlilumab has been shown to directly kill or inhibit the growth of CD27 expressing lymphomas and leukemias in in vitro and in vivo models. We have entered into license agreements with the University of Southampton, UK for intellectual property to use anti-CD27 antibodies and with Medarex (acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS) for access to the UltiMab technology to develop and commercialize human antibodies to CD27. Varlilumab was initially studied as a single-agent to establish a safety profile and assess immunologic and clinical activity in patients with cancer, but we believe the greatest opportunity for varlilumab is as an immune activator in combination with other agents. Currently, we are focusing our efforts on a Phase 1/2 clinical trial being conducted in collaboration with BMS and their PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, Opdivo. Varlilumab has also been explored in other combination studies, including with glembatumumab vedotin, and is being studied in ongoing and planned investigator-sponsored and collaborative studies.\nSingle-Agent Phase 1 Study: In an open-label Phase 1 study of varlilumab in patients with selected malignant solid tumors or hematologic cancers, varlilumab demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and induced immunologic activity in patients that is consistent with both its proposed mechanism of action and data in preclinical models. A total of 90 patients received varlilumab in the study at multiple clinical sites in the U.S. In both the solid tumor and hematologic dose escalations, the pre-specified maximum dose level (10 mg/kg) was reached without identification of a MTD. The majority of adverse events, or AEs, related to treatment have been mild to moderate (Grade 1/2) in severity, and no significant immune-mediated adverse events typically associated with checkpoint blockade have been observed. Durable, multi-year clinical benefit was demonstrated in select patients without additional anticancer therapy, including a complete response in a patient with Hodgkin lymphoma (ongoing at last follow-up at 2.8 years) and a partial response in a patient with renal cell carcinoma (ongoing at last follow-up at 3.7 years). In addition, a patient with renal cell carcinoma that experienced significant stable disease (4+ years) subsequently achieved a partial response maintained through last follow-up at 4.6+ years without additional anticancer therapy. Twelve patients experienced stable disease up to 14 months. Final results from the study in patients with solid tumors were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in April 2017.\nPhase 1/2 Varlilumab/Opdivo\u00ae Combination Study: In 2014, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of varlilumab and Opdivo, Bristol-Myers Squibb's PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, in a Phase 1/2 study. Under the terms of this clinical trial collaboration, Bristol-Myers Squibb made a one-time payment to us of $5.0 million, and the companies amended the terms of our existing license agreement with Medarex (acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb) related to our CD27 program whereby certain future milestone payments were waived and future royalty rates were reduced that may have been due from us to Medarex. In return, Bristol-Myers Squibb was granted a time-limited right of first negotiation if we wish to out-license varlilumab. The companies also agreed to work exclusively with each other to explore anti-PD-1 antagonist antibody and anti-CD27 agonist antibody combination regimens. The clinical trial collaboration provides that the companies will share development costs and that we will be responsible for conducting the Phase 1/2 study.\nThe Phase 1/2 study was initiated in January 2015 and is being conducted in adult patients with multiple solid tumors to assess the safety and tolerability of varlilumab at varying doses when administered with Opdivo, followed by a Phase 2 expansion to evaluate the activity of the combination in disease specific cohorts.\nData (n=36) from the Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the study were presented in an oral presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting in June 2017. The majority of patients had PD-L1 negative tumor at baseline and presented with stage IV, heavily pre-treated disease. 80% of patients enrolled presented with refractory or recurrent colorectal (n=21) or ovarian cancer (n=8), a population expected to have minimal response to checkpoint blockade. The primary objective of the Phase 1 portion of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination. The combination was well tolerated at all varlilumab dose levels tested without any evidence of increased autoimmunity or inappropriate immune activation. Marked changes in the tumor microenvironment including increased infiltrating CD8+ T cells and increased PD-L1 expression, which have been shown to correlate with a greater magnitude of treatment effect from checkpoint inhibitors in other clinical studies, were observed. Additional evidence of immune activity, such as increase in inflammatory chemokines and decrease in T regulatory cells, was also noted. Notable disease control was also observed (stable disease or better for at least 3 months), considering the stage IV patient population contained mostly (80%) colorectal and ovarian cases: 0.1 mg/kg varlilumab + 240 mg Opdivo: 1/5 (20%), 1 mg/kg varlilumab + 240 mg Opdivo: 5/15 (33%) and 10 mg/kg varlilumab + 240 mg Opdivo: 6/15 (40%).\nThree partial responses (PR) were observed. A patient with PD-L1 negative, MMR proficient (MSI-low) colorectal cancer, typically unlikely to respond to checkpoint blockade monotherapy, achieved a confirmed PR (95% decrease in target lesions) and following completion of combination treatment, continues to receive treatment with Opdivo monotherapy at 31+ months. A patient with low PD-L1 (5% expression) squamous cell head and neck cancer achieved a confirmed PR (59% shrinkage) and experienced PFS of 6.7 months. A patient with PD-L1 negative ovarian cancer experienced a single timepoint PR (49% shrinkage) but discontinued treatment to a dose-limiting toxicity (immune hepatitis, an event known to be associated with checkpoint inhibition therapy). A subgroup analysis was conducted in patients with ovarian cancer based on an observed increase of PD-L1 and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in this patient population. In patients with paired baseline and on-treatment biopsies (n=13), only 15% were PD-L1 positive (\u00b3 1% tumor cells) at baseline compared to 77% during treatment (p=0.015). Patients with increased tumor PD-L1 expression and tumor CD8 T cells correlated with better clinical outcome with treatment (stable disease or better).\nThe Phase 2 portion of the study opened to enrollment in April 2016 and completed enrollment in January 2018 with cohorts in colorectal cancer (n=21), ovarian cancer (n=58), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (n=24), renal cell carcinoma (n=14) and glioblastoma (n=22). The primary objective of the Phase 2 cohorts is ORR, except glioblastoma, where the primary objective is the rate of 12-month OS. Secondary objectives include pharmacokinetic assessments, determining the immunogenicity of varlilumab when given in combination with Opdivo, evaluating alternate dosing schedules of varlilumab and further assessing the anti-tumor activity of combination treatment. We plan to work with BMS to present data from the study at future medical meetings in 2018.\nThird-Party Sponsored Studies: We have also entered into a CRADA with the NCI under which NCI is sponsoring a Phase 2 study of varlilumab in combination with nivolumab in relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Patients receive either nivolumab alone or the combination. The primary outcome measure is ORR. Secondary outcome measures include DOR, safety, PFS and OS. The study opened to enrollment in January 2018 and is expected to enroll 106 patients.\nCDX-3379\nCDX-3379 is a human monoclonal antibody with half-life extension designed to block the activity of ErbB3 (HER3). We believe ErbB3 may be an important receptor regulating cancer cell growth and survival as well as resistance to targeted therapies and is expressed in many cancers, including head and neck, thyroid, breast, lung and gastric cancers, as well as melanoma. We believe the proposed mechanism of action for CDX-3379 sets it apart from other drugs in development in this class due to its ability to block both ligand-independent and ligand-dependent ErbB3 signaling by binding to a unique epitope. It has a favorable pharmacologic profile, including a longer half-life and slower clearance relative to other drug candidates in this class. We believe CDX-3379 also has potential to enhance anti-tumor activity and/or overcome resistance in combination with other targeted and cytotoxic therapies to directly kill tumor cells. Tumor cell death and the ensuing release of new tumor antigens has the potential to serve as a focus for combination therapy with immuno-oncology approaches, even in refractory patients. CDX-3379 has been evaluated in three Phase 1 studies for the treatment of multiple solid tumors that express ErbB3 and is currently being evaluated is a Phase 2 study in combination with cetuximab in cetuximab-resistant, advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.\nThe most recent data for CDX-3379 were reported from a Phase 1a/1b study conducted in solid tumors. The study included a single-agent, dose-escalation portion and combination expansion cohorts. The single-agent, dose-escalation portion of the study did not identify an MTD, and there were no dose limiting toxicities. The most common adverse events included rash and diarrhea and were predominantly grade 1 or 2. Four combination arms across multiple tumor types were added to evaluate CDX-3379 with several drugs that target EGFR, HER2 or BRAF. They include combinations\nwith Erbitux\u00ae (n=16), Tarceva\u00ae (n=8), Zelboraf\u00ae (n=9) and Herceptin\u00ae (n=10). Patients had advanced disease and were generally heavily pretreated. Across the combination arms, the most frequent adverse events were diarrhea, nausea, rash and fatigue. Objective responses were observed in the Erbitux and Zelboraf combination arms. In the Erbitux arm, there was one durable complete response in a patient with head and neck cancer, who had been previously treated with Erbitux and was refractory. In the Zelboraf arm, there were two partial responses in patients who had lung cancer, one of whom had been previously treated with Tafinlar\u00ae and was considered refractory, as well as a single timepoint partial response in a patient with thyroid cancer. Initial data were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting in June 2016.\nWe have initiated an open-label Phase 2 study in combination with Erbitux in approximately 30 patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) negative, Erbitux-resistant, advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who have previously been treated with an anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor, a population with limited options and a particularly poor prognosis. We opened the study to enrollment in November 2017. The primary objective of the study is objective response rate. Second objectives include assessments of clinical benefit response (CBR), DOR, PFS and OS, and safety and pharmacokinetics associated with the combination.\nCDX-014\nCDX-014 is a human monoclonal ADC that targets T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1, or TIM-1. TIM-1 expression is upregulated in several cancers, most notably renal cell and ovarian carcinomas, and is associated with a more malignant phenotype of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and tumor progression. TIM-1 has restricted expression in healthy tissues, making it potentially amenable to an ADC approach. The TIM-1 antibody is linked to MMAE using Seattle Genetics' proprietary technology. The ADC is designed to be stable in the bloodstream but to release MMAE upon internalization into TIM-1-expressing tumor cells, resulting in a targeted cell-killing effect. CDX-014 has shown anti-tumor activity in preclinical models of ovarian and renal cancers.\nIn July 2016, we announced that enrollment had opened in a Phase 1/2 study of CDX-014 to patients with both clear cell and papillary RCC. In January 2018, we amended the protocol, converting the study to Phase 1, expanding enrollment to include patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma and enabling the evaluation of alternate dosing regimens. Enrollment is ongoing. The study includes a dose-escalation portion across three separate cohorts to determine the MTD followed by expansion cohorts of up to 15 patients each to assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of CDX-014, as measured by objective response rate. Secondary objectives include safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and additional measures of anti-tumor activity.\nCDX-1140\nCDX-1140 is a fully human antibody targeted to CD40, a key activator of immune response which is found on dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells and is also expressed on many cancer cells. Potent CD40 agonist antibodies have shown encouraging results in early clinical studies; however, systemic toxicity associated with broad CD40 activation has limited their dosing. CDX-1140 has unique properties relative to other CD40 agonist antibodies: potent agonist activity is independent of Fc receptor interaction, contributing to more consistent, controlled immune activation; CD40L binding is not blocked, leading to potential synergistic effects of agonist activity near activated T cells in lymph nodes and tumors; and the antibody does not promote cytokine production in whole blood assays. CDX-1140 has shown direct anti-tumor activity in preclinical models of lymphoma. Preclinical studies of CDX-1140 clearly demonstrate strong immune activation effects and low systemic toxicity and support the design of the Phase 1 study to rapidly identify the dose for characterizing single-agent and combination activity.\nWe initiated a Phase 1 study of CDX-1140 in November 2017. This study, which is expected to enroll up to approximately 105 patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, is designed to determine the MTD during a dose-escalation phase (0.01 to 3.0 mg/kg once every four weeks until confirmed progression or intolerance) and to recommend a dose level for further study in a subsequent expansion phase. The expansion is designed to further evaluate the tolerability and biologic effects of selected dose(s) of CDX-1140 in specific tumor types. Secondary objectives include assessments of safety and tolerability, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and additional measures of anti-tumor activity, including clinical benefit rate. We believe that the potential for CDX-1140 will be best defined in combination studies with other immunotherapies or conventional cancer treatments.\nCDX-301\nCDX-301, a recombinant FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand, or Flt3L, is a hematopoietic cytokine that uniquely expands dendritic cells and hematopoietic stem cells in combination with other agents to potentiate the anti-tumor response. Depending on the setting, cells expanded by CDX-301 promote either enhanced or permissive immunity. CDX-301 is in clinical development for multiple cancers, in combination with vaccines, adjuvants and other treatments that release tumor antigens. We licensed CDX-301 from Amgen Inc. in March 2009 and believe CDX-301 may hold significant opportunity for synergistic development in combination with other proprietary molecules in our portfolio.\nA Phase 1 study of CDX-301 evaluated seven different dosing regimens of CDX-301 to determine the appropriate dose for further development based on safety, tolerability and biological activity. The data from the study were consistent with previous clinical experience and demonstrated that CDX-301 has an acceptable safety profile to date and can mobilize hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations in healthy volunteers.\nCDX-301's potential activity is being explored in investigator sponsored and collaborative studies. A Phase 2 study of CDX-301 in combination with CDX-1401 is being conducted in malignant melanoma by the Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network (CITN) under a CRADA with the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program of the NCI. This study was designed to determine the activity of CDX-1401 with or without CDX-301 in melanoma. The primary outcome measure of the study is immune response to NY-ESO-1. Secondary outcome measures include analysis and characterization of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (dendritic cells, T cells, natural killer cells, etc.), additional immune monitoring, safety and clinical outcomes (survival and time to tumor recurrence). Enrollment is complete, and initial results were presented at the 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. The data confirmed that CDX-1401 is capable of driving NY-ESO-1 immunity and further demonstrated the potential of CDX-301 as a combination agent for enhancing tumor specific immune responses. The NCI and CITN are planning to enroll additional cohorts to investigate alternative regimens of CDX-301.\nCDX-301 is also being studied in a combination cohort with glembatumumab vedotin in a Phase 2 study in metastatic melanoma (opened to enrollment in January 2018) and is being studied in ongoing and planned investigator-sponsored and collaborative studies.\nCDX-1401\nCDX-1401, developed from our APC Targeting Technology, is an NY-ESO-1-antibody fusion protein for immunotherapy in multiple solid tumors. CDX-1401, which is administered with an adjuvant, is composed of the cancer-specific antigen NY-ESO-1 fused to a fully human antibody that binds to DEC-205 for efficient delivery to dendritic cells. Delivery of tumor-specific proteins directly to dendritic cells in vivo elicits potent, broad, anti-tumor immune responses across populations with different genetic backgrounds. In humans, NY-ESO-1 has been detected in 20% to 30% of melanoma,\nlung, esophageal, liver, gastric, ovarian and bladder cancers, and up to 70% of synovial sarcomas, thus representing a broad opportunity. CDX-1401 is being developed for the treatment of malignant melanoma and a variety of solid tumors which express the cancer antigen NY-ESO-1. Preclinical studies have shown that CDX-1401 treatment results in activation of human T cell responses against NY-ESO-1.\nWe completed a Phase 1 study of CDX-1401 which assessed the safety, immunogenicity and clinical activity of escalating doses of CDX-1401 with TLR agonists (resiquimod and/or poly-ICLC) in 45 patients with advanced malignancies refractory to all available therapies. Results were published in Science Translational Medicine in April 2014.\nCDX-1401's potential activity is being explored in investigator sponsored and collaborative studies. A Phase 2 study of CDX-1401 in combination with CDX-301 is being conducted in malignant melanoma by the CITN under a CRADA with the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program of the NCI. This study was designed to determine the activity of CDX-1401 with or without CDX-301 in melanoma. The primary outcome measure of the study is immune response to NY-ESO-1. Enrollment is complete, and initial results were presented at the 2016 ASCO Annual Meeting. The data confirmed that CDX-1401 is capable of driving NY-ESO-1 immunity and further demonstrated the potential of CDX-301 as a combination agent for enhancing tumor specific immune responses. The NCI and CITN are planning to enroll additional cohorts to investigate alternative regimens of CDX-301.\nIn September 2017, a randomized, open-label Phase 1/2 study of CDX-1401 in combination with atezolizumab and SGI-110 opened to enrollment in recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. This study is being conducted under a CRADA with the NCI Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis and is designed to determine the activity of atezolizumab alone, atezolizumab plus SGI-110 and atezolizumab plus SGI-110 plus CDX-1401. The primary outcome of the Phase 1 dose-escalation study is safety and only evaluates atezolizumab alone and in combination with SGI-110. The Phase 2 portion of the study is expected to add CDX-1401. The primary outcome of the Phase 2 portion of the study is a comparison of PFS between the three cohorts.\nOther studies are ongoing and planned through investigator-sponsored and collaborative agreements.\nAnti-KIT Program: CDX-0158 and CDX-0159\nKIT activation is implicated in many disease processes including some cancers, neurofibromatosis, mast cell-related diseases and autoimmune diseases. We conducted a Phase 1 dose-escalation study of CDX-0158, a humanized monoclonal antibody that is a potent inhibitor of wildtype KIT, in 28 patients with advanced refractory GIST and other KIT positive tumors with doses up to 15 mg/kg. No evidence of myelosuppression, an effect commonly associated with KIT inhibition, was observed in this study. Approximately two-thirds of the patients on study had infusion reactions that were manageable with pre-medication and longer infusion times. The biomarker data showed evidence of dose-related KIT engagement, and two patients experienced partial metabolic responses on fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET scan; however, these PET responses were not associated with tumor shrinkage.\nGiven the infusion reactions, modifications have been introduced into the Fc portion of the CDX-0158 antibody to prevent these interactions, which should eliminate the potential for Fc receptor mediated agonist activity. This second-generation version, called CDX-0159, also includes modifications to increase the half-life of the antibody, giving it an additional advantage over CDX-0158. CDX-0159 is being fully developed in-house with the intention of replacing CDX-0158 in clinical development. We expect manufacturing and IND-enabling efforts for CDX-0159 will be completed in 2018.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We believe our most critical accounting policies include accounting for business combinations, revenue recognition, intangible and long-lived assets, research and development expenses and stock-based compensation expense.\nThe methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could materially change our reported results. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our financial statements:\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. We record the fair value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. We assess the fair value of assets, including intangible assets such as IPR&D, using a variety of methods including present-value models. Each asset is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant. The method used to estimate the fair values of IPR&D assets incorporates significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset, including a market participant's assumptions regarding the probability of completing IPR&D projects, which would require obtaining regulatory approval for marketing of the associated drug candidate; a market participant's estimates regarding the timing of and the expected costs to complete IPR&D projects; a market participant's estimates of future cash flows from potential product sales; and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant. Transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with the transaction are expensed as incurred.\nThe difference between the purchase price and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination is recorded to goodwill. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis during the third quarter, or earlier if impairment indicators are present. We performed an annual impairment test of the goodwill asset as of July 1, 2017 and concluded that the goodwill asset was not impaired.\nWe record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We determine the fair value of the contingent consideration based primarily on the following factors:\n\u2022 timing and probability of success of clinical events or regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 timing and probability of success of meeting clinical and commercial milestones; and\n\u2022 discount rates.\nOur contingent consideration liabilities arose in connection with our acquisition of Kolltan. On a quarterly basis, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings. Changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates, accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time, changes in our estimates of the likelihood or timing of achieving development or commercial milestones, changes in\nthe probability of certain clinical events or changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval.\nThe assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment, and any changes in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.\nWe have entered into and in the future may enter into biopharmaceutical product development agreements with collaborative partners for the research and development of therapeutic drug candidates. The terms of the agreements may include nonrefundable signing and licensing fees; funding for research, development and manufacturing; milestone payments; and royalties on any product sales derived from collaborations. These multiple element arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting. In accounting for these transactions, we allocate revenue to the various elements based on their relative fair value. The fair value of a revenue generating element can be based on current selling prices offered by us or another party for current products or our best estimate of a selling price for future products. Revenue allocated to an individual element is recognized when all other revenue recognition criteria are met for that element.\nThese collaborative and other agreements may contain milestone payments. Revenues from milestones, if they are considered substantive, are recognized upon successful accomplishment of the milestones. Determining whether a milestone is substantive involves judgment, including an assessment of our involvement in achieving the milestones and whether the amount of the payment is commensurate to our performance. If not considered substantive, milestones are initially deferred and recognized over the remaining period of the performance obligation.\nPayments received to fund certain research activities are recognized as revenue in the period in which the research activities are performed. Revenue from contracts and grants is recognized as the services are performed and recorded as effort is expended on the contracted work and billed to the government or our contractual partner. Payments received in advance that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue when the research projects are performed.\nProduct royalty revenue consists of payments received from licensees for a portion of sales proceeds from products that utilize our licensed technologies and is recognized when the amount of and basis for such royalty payments are reported to us in accurate and appropriate form and in accordance with the related license agreement.\nIntangible and Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, and finite-lived intangible assets when circumstances indicate that an event of impairment may have occurred. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written-down to their estimated fair values.\nIPR&D assets acquired in a business combination initially are recorded at fair value and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets. These assets are capitalized on our balance sheets until either the project underlying them is completed or the assets become impaired. If a project is completed, the\ncarrying value of the related intangible asset is amortized over the remaining estimated life of the asset beginning in the period in which the project is completed. If a project becomes impaired or is abandoned, the carrying value of the related intangible asset is written down to its fair value and an impairment charge is taken in the period in which the impairment occurs. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these tests, and the models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:\n\u2022 timing and costs to complete the in-process projects;\n\u2022 timing and probability of success of clinical events or regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 estimated future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and\n\u2022 discount rates\nEach IPR&D asset is assessed for impairment at least annually or when impairment indicators are present. During the third quarter of 2017, we recorded a partial impairment charge of $13.0 million related to changes in projected development and regulatory timelines regarding the anti-KIT program. The remaining IPR&D assets were assessed for impairment during 2017 and were determined not to be impaired.\nIntangible assets acquired in a business combination with a finite life are recorded at fair value and amortized over the greater of economic consumption or on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs, including internal and contract research costs, are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist mainly of clinical trial costs, manufacturing of clinical material, toxicology and other preclinical studies, personnel costs, depreciation, license fees and funding of outside contracted research.\nClinical trial expenses include expenses associated with clinical research organization, or CRO, services. Contract manufacturing expenses include expenses associated with contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, services. The invoicing from CROs and CMOs for services rendered can lag several months. We accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with CRO and CMO activities based on our estimate of costs incurred. We maintain regular communication with our CROs and CMOs to assess the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual expenses and estimated expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nWe record stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors based on the estimated fair values of the stock-based awards expected to vest at the grant date and adjust, if necessary, to reflect actual forfeitures. Our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of future uncertain events. Significant assumptions include the use of historical volatility to estimate the expected stock price volatility. We also estimate expected term based on historical exercise patterns. Actual volatility and lives of options may be significantly different from our estimates. Compensation expense for all stock-based awards to employees and directors is recognized using the straight-line method over the term of vesting or performance.\nWe record stock-based compensation expense for stock options granted to non-employees based on the fair value of the stock options which is re-measured over the vesting term resulting in periodic adjustments to stock-based compensation expense.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared with Year Ended December 31, 2016\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

primarily the result of a decrease in research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses and increases in contract revenues. The non-cash income tax benefit impacting net loss was partially offset by the non-cash in-process research and development impairment charge.\nRevenue\nThe $1.0 million increase in product development and licensing agreements revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to an increase in reimbursable clinical trial expenses related to our BMS agreement. The $5.0 million increase in contracts and grants revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily related to our International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and Frontier Biotechnologies, Inc. agreements executed in 2017.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of (i) personnel expenses, (ii) laboratory supply expenses relating to the development of our technology, (iii) facility expenses, (iv) license fees and (v) product development expenses associated with our drug candidates as follows:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>Increase/ (Decrease) </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(In thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>36,470 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>36,070 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Laboratory Supplies\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>817 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> License Fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(937 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (58 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product Development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,852 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,141 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (22 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPersonnel expenses primarily include salary, benefits, stock-based compensation and payroll taxes. The $0.4 million increase in personnel expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to an increase in salaries expense and headcount related to the Kolltan acquisition partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expenses. We expect personnel expenses to remain relatively consistent over the next twelve months, although there may be fluctuations on a quarterly basis.\nLaboratory supplies expenses include laboratory materials and supplies, services, and other related expenses incurred in the development of our technology. The $0.8 million increase in laboratory supply expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to higher laboratory materials and supplies purchases. We expect laboratory supplies expenses to remain relatively consistent over the next twelve months, although there may be fluctuations on a quarterly basis.\nFacility expenses include depreciation, amortization, utilities, rent, maintenance and other related expenses incurred at our facilities. The $2.3 million increase in facility expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to the addition of our New Haven, CT facility that we acquired with the Kolltan acquisition and higher depreciation expense of $1.3 million. In March 2017, we terminated our lease in Branford, CT and consolidated our Connecticut operations in our New Haven facility. We expect facility expenses to remain relatively consistent over the next twelve months, although there may be fluctuations on a quarterly basis\nLicense fee expenses include annual license maintenance fees and milestone payments due upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. The $0.9 million decrease in license fee expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was due to the timing of certain development and/or regulatory milestones achieved by our drug candidates. We expect license fee expense to remain relatively consistent over the next twelve months, although there may be fluctuations on a quarterly basis.\nProduct development expenses include clinical investigator site fees, external trial monitoring costs, data accumulation costs, contracted research and outside clinical drug product manufacturing. The $10.1 million decrease in product development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to lower contract manufacturing and clinical trial costs of $9.9 and $7.6 million, respectively, related to varlilumab and Rintega. These decreases were partially offset by increases in (i) glembatumumab vedotin contract manufacturing expenses of $2.7 million and (ii) glembatumumab vedotin, anti-KIT and CDX-3379 clinical trial costs of $3.6 million. The amount of product development expenses incurred over the next twelve months will\nbe impacted by our clinical data results from our METRIC clinical study and their impact on our pace of commercial manufacturing.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nThe $11.0 million decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to lower commercial planning costs of $4.5 million, lower stock-based compensation of $1.9 million and lower severance expense related to the Kolltan acquisition of $2.6 million. The amount of general and administrative expenses incurred over the next twelve months will be impacted by our clinical data results from our METRIC clinical study and their impact on the rate of expansion of our commercial operations.\nIn-Process Research and Development Impairment\nWe recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $13.0 million on the anti-KIT program IPR&D assets acquired from Kolltan during the year ended December 31, 2017. This impairment charge was related to changes in projected development and regulatory timelines regarding the anti-KIT program.\nGain on Fair Value Remeasurement of Contingent Consideration\nThe $0.8 million gain on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to a reduction in fair value attributed to milestones related to our anti-KIT and TAM programs, partially offset by losses related to changes in discount rates, passage of time and probabilities affecting remaining milestones. See Note 4 to the financial statements included herein for a discussion of the contingent consideration that may be payable related to the Kolltan acquisition.\nAmortization Expense\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was relatively consistent with the year ended December 31, 2016. We expect amortization expense of acquired intangible assets to remain consistent over the next twelve months.\nInvestment and Other Income, Net\nThe $0.2 million decrease in investment and other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to lower levels of cash and investment balances, partially offset by higher interest rates on fixed income investments. We anticipate investment income to decrease over the next twelve months due to lower levels of cash and investment balances.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nWe recorded a non-cash income tax benefit of $19.1 million related to decreases in net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA). In addition, we recorded a non-cash income tax benefit of $5.2 million related to the partial impairment of the anti-KIT program IPR&D assets.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 compared with Year Ended

loss for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily the result of an increase in research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses, offset by an increase in investment and other income and revenue.\nRevenue\nThe $0.7 million increase in product development and licensing agreements revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily related to our BMS agreement. The $0.6 million increase in contracts and grants revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily related to an increase in grant revenue of $1.2 million, partially offset by a decrease of $0.7 million in revenue from our Rockefeller University agreement pursuant to which we perform research and development services for Rockefeller.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of (i) personnel expenses, (ii) laboratory supply expenses relating to the development of our technology, (iii) facility expenses, (iv) license fees and (v) product development expenses associated with our drug candidates as follows:\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>Increase/\n(Decrease) </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(In thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>36,070 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>29,774 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>6,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Laboratory Supplies\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(658 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (15 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> License Fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>896 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>718 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product Development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,852 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,776 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,924 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (11 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $6.3 million increase in personnel expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily due to Kolltan-related severance expense and higher stock-based compensation of $0.7 million and $1.6 million, respectively, and increased headcount.\nThe $0.7 million decrease in laboratory supply expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily due to lower manufacturing supply purchases.\nThe $0.6 million increase in facility expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily due to an increase in rent.\nThe $0.7 million increase in license fee expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was due to the timing of certain development and/or regulatory milestones achieved by our drug candidates.\nThe $5.9 million decrease in product development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily due to a $19.9 million decrease in Rintega program costs. That decrease was partially offset by increases in glembatumumab vedotin and varlilumab program costs of $4.6 million and $9.6 million, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nThe $2.1 million increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily due to Kolltan-related severance expense, restructuring expense related to our decision to not occupy our Needham, MA expansion space and higher stock-based compensation of $2.4 million, $1.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively. Those increases were partially offset by lower commercial planning costs of $2.8 million.\nAmortization Expense\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was consistent compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInvestment and Other Income, Net\nThe $2.0 million increase in investment and other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily due to higher other income of $1.8 million related to our sale of New Jersey tax benefits.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase and consist primarily of investments in money market mutual funds with commercial banks and financial institutions. We maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits. We do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances. We invest our excess cash balances in marketable securities, including municipal bond securities, U.S. government agency securities and high-grade corporate bonds that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. Our investment policy seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity.\nThe use of our cash flows for operations has primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees; facility and facility-related costs for our offices, laboratories and manufacturing facility; fees paid in connection with preclinical studies, clinical studies, contract manufacturing, laboratory supplies and services; and consulting, legal and other professional fees. To date, the primary sources of cash flows from operations have been payments received from our collaborative partners and from government entities. The timing of any new collaboration agreements, government contracts or grants and any payments under these agreements, contracts or grants cannot be easily predicted and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nAt December 31, 2017, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $139.4 million. We have had recurring losses and incurred a loss of $93.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $99.9 million. We believe that the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2017 combined with the (i) $6.1 million in net proceeds from sales of our common stock under the Cantor agreement from January 1, 2018 through February 28, 2018 and (ii) anticipated proceeds from future sales of our common stock under the Cantor agreement, are sufficient to meet estimated working capital requirements and fund planned operations through 2019. This could be impacted by our clinical data results from our METRIC clinical study and their impact on our pace of commercial manufacturing and the rate of expansion of our commercial operations. This could also be impacted if we elected to pay Kolltan contingent milestones, if any, in cash.\nDuring the next twelve months, we will take further steps to raise additional capital to meet our liquidity needs. Our capital raising activities may include, but may not be limited to, one or more of the following: the licensing of drug candidates with existing or new collaborative partners, possible business combinations, issuance of debt, or the issuance of common stock or other securities via private placements or public offerings. While we may seek capital through a number of means, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and our negotiating position in capital-raising efforts may worsen as existing resources are used. There is also no assurance that we will be able to enter into further collaborative relationships. Additional equity financings may be dilutive to our stockholders; debt financing, if available, may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate as a business; and licensing or strategic collaborations may result in royalties or other terms which reduce our economic potential from products under development. Our ability to continue funding our planned operations into and beyond twelve months from the issuance date is also dependent on the timing and manner of payment of future contingent milestones from the Kolltan acquisition, in the event that we achieve the drug candidate milestones related to those payments. We may decide to pay those milestone payments in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof. If we are unable to raise the funds necessary to meet our liquidity needs, we may have to delay or discontinue the development of one or more programs, discontinue or delay ongoing or anticipated clinical trials, license out programs earlier than expected, raise funds at a significant discount or on other unfavorable terms, if at all, or sell all or a part of our business.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $99.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $113.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in revenue and decreases in both general and administrative and research and development expenses. We expect that cash used in operating activities will decrease over the next twelve months, although there may be fluctuations on a quarterly basis.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $113.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $98.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net loss of $1.3 million and changes in working capital.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs in the area of research and development, including preclinical and clinical trials and clinical drug product manufacturing as our drug candidates are developed. We plan to spend significant amounts to progress our current drug candidates through the clinical trial and commercialization processes as well as to develop additional drug candidates. As our drug candidates progress through the clinical trial process, we may be obligated to make significant milestone payments.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $46.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $68.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to net sales and maturities of marketable securities for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $48.3 million as compared to net sales and maturities of marketable securities of $68.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. We expect that cash provided by investing activities will decrease over the next twelve months as we decrease cash used in operations which is funded mainly through the combination of net proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities, cash provided by financing activities and/or new partnerships, although there may be significant fluctuations on a quarterly basis.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $68.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net cash used by investing activities of $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to net sales and maturities of marketable securities for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $68.9 million as compared to net purchases of marketable securities of $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net proceeds from stock issuances, including stock issued pursuant to employee benefit plans, were $51.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $193.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net proceeds from stock issuances, including stock issued pursuant to employee benefit plans, were $14.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $193.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nEquity Offerings\nIn December 2013, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register for sale any combination of the types of securities described in the shelf registration statement. In December 2016, we filed a new shelf registration statement with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission to register for sale any combination of the types of securities described in the shelf registration statement up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $250.0 million. Such registration statement was declared effective on February 13, 2017.\nIn May 2016, we entered into an agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (\"Cantor\") to allow us to issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $60.0 million from time to time through Cantor, acting as agent. In November 2017, we filed a prospectus supplement registering the offer and sale of shares of common stock of up to an additional $75.0 million under the agreement with Cantor. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we issued 17,722,863 and 3,303,800 shares of common stock, respectively, under this controlled equity offering sales agreement with Cantor resulting in net proceeds of $51.0 million and $13.9 million, respectively, after deducting commission and offering expenses. At December 31, 2017, we had $67.6 million remaining in aggregate gross offering price available under the Cantor agreement. From January 1, 2018 through February 28, 2018, we issued 2,401,847 shares of our common stock resulting in net proceeds of $6.1 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we issued 8,337,500 shares of our common stock in underwritten public offerings resulting in net proceeds to us of $188.8 million after deducting underwriting fees and offering expenses.\nAGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nWe have entered into license agreements whereby we have received licenses or options to license technology, specified patents and/or patent applications. These license and collaboration agreements generally provide for royalty payments equal to specified percentages of product sales, annual license maintenance fees, continuing patent prosecution costs and potential future milestone payments to third parties upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones had not occurred as of December 31, 2017 such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements. We expect to incur approximately $0.2 million of license and milestone payments in 2018.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations (not including contingent royalty and milestone payments as described above) at December 31, 2017 and the effect such obligations and commercial commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future years. These obligations, commitments and supporting arrangements represent expected payments based on current operating forecasts, which are subject to change:\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>2018 </th> <th> </th> <th>2019 - 2020 </th> <th> </th> <th>2021 - 2022 </th> <th> </th> <th>Thereafter </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(In thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual obligations:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>11,561 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>4,591 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>6,970 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other contractual obligations(2)(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>22,891 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>15,921 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>6,970 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Such amounts primarily consist of payments for our facility leases and do not assume the exercise of renewal terms or early termination provisions.\n(2)We enter into agreements in the normal course of business with contract research organizations for clinical trials, contract manufacturing organizations, vendors for preclinical research studies and other services and products for operating purposes.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of several immunotherapy technologies and other cancer-targeting biologics. Our drug candidates, including antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates and other protein-based therapeutics, are derived from a broad set of complementary technologies which have the ability to engage the human immune system and/or directly inhibit tumors to treat specific types of cancer or other diseases.\nOur latest stage drug candidate, glembatumumab vedotin (also referred to as CDX-011) is a targeted antibody-drug conjugate in a randomized, Phase 2b study for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer and a Phase 2 study for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Varlilumab (also referred to as CDX-1127) is an immune modulating antibody that is designed to enhance a patient's immune response against cancer. We established proof of principle in a Phase 1 study with varlilumab, which supported the initiation of combination studies in various indications. CDX-3379, a human monoclonal antibody designed to block the activity of ErbB3 (HER3), is in Phase 2 development in combination with cetuximab for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. We also have a number of earlier stage drug candidates in clinical development, including CDX-014, an antibody-drug conjugate targeting renal and ovarian cancers; CDX-1140, a human monoclonal antibody targeted to CD40, a key activator of immune response; CDX-301, an immune cell mobilizing agent and dendritic cell growth factor; and CDX-1401, a targeted immunotherapeutic aimed at antigen presenting cells, or APCs, for cancer indications. Our drug candidates address market opportunities for which we believe current therapies are inadequate or non-existent.\nWe are building a fully integrated, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops important therapies for patients with unmet medical needs. Our program assets provide us with the strategic options to either retain full economic rights to our innovative therapies or seek favorable economic terms through advantageous commercial partnerships. This approach allows us to maximize the overall value of our technology and product portfolio while best ensuring the expeditious development of each individual product.\nThe following table reflects Celldex-sponsored clinical studies that we are actively pursuing at this time. All programs are currently fully owned by Celldex.\n\n(1)checkpoint inhibitor;\n(2)BMS collaboration\nWe also routinely work with external parties, such as government agencies, to collaboratively advance our drug candidates. The following pipeline reflects clinical trials of our drug candidates being actively pursued by outside organizations. In addition to the studies listed below, we also have an\nInvestigator Initiated Research (IIR) program with six studies ongoing with our drug candidates and additional studies currently under consideration.\n\nThe expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties. Completion of clinical trials may take several years or more, and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a drug candidate. It is not unusual for the clinical development of these types of drug candidates to each take five years or more, and for total development costs to exceed $100 million for each drug candidate. We estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following timelines:\n\nThe duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022 the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial;\n\u2022 the duration of patient follow-up that seems appropriate in view of results;\n\u2022 the number of clinical sites included in the trials;\n\u2022 the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects; and\n\u2022 the efficacy and safety profile of the drug candidate.\nWe test potential drug candidates in numerous preclinical studies for safety, toxicology and immunogenicity. We may then conduct multiple clinical trials for each drug candidate. As we obtain results from trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain drug candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising drug candidates.\nAn element of our business strategy is to pursue the research and development of a broad portfolio of drug candidates. This is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures. To the extent we are unable to maintain a broad range of drug candidates, our dependence on the success of one or a few drug candidates increases.\nRegulatory approval is required before we can market our drug candidates as therapeutic products. In order to proceed to subsequent clinical trial stages and to ultimately achieve regulatory approval, the regulatory agency must conclude that our clinical data are safe and effective. Historically, the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials (through Phase 2) have often not been predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials. A number of new drugs and biologics have shown promising results in early clinical trials but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals.\nFurthermore, our business strategy includes the option of entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our drug candidates. In the event that third parties take over the clinical trial process for one of our drug candidates, the estimated completion date would largely be under control of that third party rather than us. We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products, if any, will be subject to future collaborative arrangements, in whole or in part, and how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements. Our programs may also benefit from subsidies, grants, contracts or government or agency-sponsored studies that could reduce our development costs.\nAs a result of the uncertainties discussed above, among others, it is difficult to accurately estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when, if ever, and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product. Our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements, when appropriate, could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity. These uncertainties could force us to seek additional, external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy. Our inability to raise additional capital, or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us, would jeopardize the future success of our business.\nDuring the past five years through December 31, 2017, we incurred an aggregate of $470.9 million in research and development expenses. The following table indicates the amount incurred for each of our significant research programs and for other identified research and development activities during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The amounts disclosed in the following table reflect direct research and development costs, license fees associated with the underlying technology and an allocation of indirect research and development costs to each program.\n\nClinical Development Programs\nGlembatumumab Vedotin\nGlembatumumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, that consists of a fully human monoclonal antibody, CR011, linked to a potent cell-killing drug, monomethyl auristatin E, or MMAE. The CR011 antibody specifically targets glycoprotein NMB, referred to as gpNMB, that is over-expressed in a variety of cancers including breast cancer, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, uveal melanoma and osteosarcoma, among others. The ADC technology, comprised of MMAE and a stable linker system for attaching it to CR011, was licensed from Seattle Genetics, Inc. and is the same\nas that used in the marketed product Adcetris\u00ae. The ADC is designed to be stable in the bloodstream. Following intravenous administration, glembatumumab vedotin targets and binds to gpNMB, and upon internalization into the targeted cell, glembatumumab vedotin is designed to release MMAE from CR011 to produce a cell-killing effect. Glembatumumab vedotin is being studied across multiple indications in company-sponsored trials and in collaborative studies with external parties. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has granted fast track designation to glembatumumab vedotin for the treatment of advanced, refractory/resistant gpNMB-expressing breast cancer. A companion diagnostic is in development for certain indications, and we expect that, if necessary, such a companion diagnostic must be approved by the FDA or certain other foreign regulatory agencies before glembatumumab vedotin may be commercialized in those indications.\nTreatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer: Glembatumumab vedotin has been evaluated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in multiple studies including a single-arm Phase 1/2 study (Journal of Clinical Oncology, September 2014); a randomized, controlled Phase 2b study compared to Investigator's Choice chemotherapy in patients with gpNMB-positive MBC called EMERGE (Journal of Clinical Oncology, April 2015); and the ongoing randomized, controlled Phase 2b study in patients with triple negative, gpNMB overexpressing breast cancer, called METRIC. We expect to report topline primary endpoint data from the METRIC study during the second quarter of 2018.\nThe most recent data presented for glembatumumab vedotin in breast cancer are from the EMERGE study, the randomized, multi-center Phase 2b study in 124 patients with heavily pre-treated, advanced, gpNMB-positive breast cancer. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either glembatumumab vedotin or single-agent Investigator's Choice chemotherapy. Patients randomized to receive Investigator's Choice were allowed to cross over to receive glembatumumab vedotin following disease progression. Activity endpoints included response rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The final study results, as shown below, suggested that glembatumumab vedotin induced significant response rates compared to currently available therapies in patient subsets with advanced, refractory breast cancers with high gpNMB expression (expression in at least 25% of tumor cells) and in patients with triple negative breast cancer. The OS and PFS of patients treated with glembatumumab vedotin were also observed to be greatest in patients with high gpNMB expression and, in particular, in patients with triple negative breast cancer who also had high gpNMB expression. Adverse events prominent with the glembatumumab vedotin arm included rash and peripheral neuropathy, while hematologic toxicity was more frequent and severe in the Investigator's Choice arm.\nEMERGE: Overall Response Rate and Disease Control Data (Intent-to-Treat Population)\n\nTumor response assessed by RECIST 1.1, inclusive of response observed at a single time point.\nEMERGE: Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) Data\n\nIn December 2013, we initiated METRIC, a randomized, controlled (2:1) Phase 2b study of glembatumumab vedotin versus Xeloda\u00ae in patients with triple negative breast cancer that over-expresses gpNMB. Clinical trial study sites were opened to enrollment across the U.S., Canada, Australia and the European Union. The METRIC protocol was amended in late 2014 based on feedback from clinical investigators conducting the study that the eligibility criteria for study entry were limiting their ability to enroll patients they felt were clinically appropriate. In addition, we had spoken to country-specific members of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and believed an opportunity existed to expand the study into the EU. The amendment expanded patient entry criteria to position it for the possibility of full marketing approval with global regulators, including the EMA, and to support improved enrollment in the study. The primary endpoint of the study is PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the earlier of disease progression or death due to any cause. PFS is an established endpoint for full approval registration studies in this patient population in both the U.S. and the EU. The sample size (n=300) and the secondary endpoint of OS remained unchanged. Since implementation of these changes, both the FDA and central European regulatory authorities have reviewed the protocol design, and we believe the METRIC study could potentially support marketing approval in both the U.S. and Europe dependent upon data results and review.\nEnrollment (n=327) in METRIC was completed in August 2017. The study calls for 203 progression events for evaluation of the primary endpoint, which will be assessed based on an independent, central reading of patient scans. The sum of the data, including the secondary endpoints of response rate, OS, DOR and safety, will be important in assessing clinical benefit. Based on the current rate of progression events in the study, the Company projects that topline primary endpoint data should be available in the second quarter of 2018.\nEfforts to ensure delivery of manufactured drug that is ready for commercialization and a companion diagnostic are underway. While we have made and continue to make progress on these fronts, we have made the decision to stage some of the more costly work in these areas to begin after we have received results from the study. While this step will extend the timeline to complete our regulatory submissions, we believe this is the most prudent use of our funds as we seek to advance our pipeline overall. Assuming positive data, we plan to work with the FDA on a regulatory strategy that would support submitting a Biologics License Application (BLA) in the second half of 2019.\nTreatment of Metastatic Melanoma: Glembatumumab vedotin has been evaluated for the treatment of unresectable stage III or IV metastatic melanoma in two studies including a single-arm Phase 1/2 open-label study and an ongoing multi-cohort Phase 2 study. Results from the Phase 1/2 study were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in September 2014.\nThe most recent data for glembatumumab vedotin in metastatic melanoma are from the ongoing Phase 2 study. This study currently includes four single arm cohorts: (1) a single-agent cohort (enrollment completed; data presented at ASCO 2017), (2) a combination cohort with varlilumab (enrollment completed; data presented at SITC 2017), (3) a combination cohort with an approved\ncheckpoint inhibitor (i.e., Opdivo\u00ae or Keytruda\u00ae) following progression on the checkpoint inhibitor alone (enrollment completed; follow-up continues), and (4) a combination cohort with CDX-301 (enrollment ongoing).\nThe primary endpoint for each cohort is ORR, except the fourth cohort which is assessing safety and tolerability in anticipation of additional combinations. Secondary endpoints include analyses of PFS, DOR, OS, retrospective investigation of whether the anticancer activity of glembatumumab vedotin is dependent upon the degree of gpNMB expression in tumor tissue and safety of both the monotherapy and combination regimens.\nWe presented mature data from the single-agent cohort in an oral presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June 2017. The cohort enrolled 62 evaluable patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma. All patients had been heavily pre-treated (median prior therapies = 3; range 1-8) and had progressed during or after checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and almost all patients had received both ipilimumab (n=58; 94%) and anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 (n=58; 94%) therapy. Twelve patients presented with BRAF mutation, and fifteen had prior treatment with BRAF or BRAF/MEK targeted agents. Median OS for all patients was 9.0 months (95% CI: 6.1, 13.0). The primary endpoint of the cohort (threshold of 6 or more objective responses in 52 evaluable patients) was exceeded. 7 of 62 (11%) patients experienced a confirmed response. One patient experienced a complete response (CR), and six patients experienced partial responses (PR). An additional three patients also experienced single timepoint PRs. The median DOR was 6.0 months. A 52% disease control rate (patients without progression for greater than three months) was demonstrated, and median PFS for all patients was 4.4 months. Consistent with previous studies in melanoma and breast cancer, early development of rash was associated with greater clinical benefit, including more prolonged PFS and OS. The safety profile was consistent with prior studies of glembatumumab vedotin with rash, neutropenia and neuropathy experienced as the most significant adverse events. Pre-treatment tumor tissue was available for 59 patients. All samples were gpNMB positive, and 78% of patients had tumors with 100% of their epithelial cells expressing gpNMB. Given both the high level of expression and the intensity of expression across this patient population, identifying a potential population for gpNMB enrichment is not feasible; therefore, all patients with metastatic melanoma could be evaluated as potential candidates for treatment with glembatumumab vedotin in future studies.\nData from the second cohort, combining glembatumumab vedotin and varlilumab, were presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer's (SITC) 32nd Annual Meeting in November 2017. The cohort enrolled 34 patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma. All patients had been heavily pre-treated (median prior therapies = 3; range 1-8) and had progressed during or after checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy (median prior CPI therapies = 2; range 1-4). Almost all patients had received ipilimumab (n=26; 76%) and/or anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 (n=34; 100%) therapy. Nine patients presented with BRAF mutation, and eleven had prior treatment with BRAF or BRAF/MEK targeted agents. Median PFS for all patients was 2.6 months (95% CI: 1.4, 2.8), and median OS for all patients was 6.4 months (95% CI: 3.2, 8.3). One of 31 patients eligible for response evaluation experienced a confirmed partial response (3%), and an additional two patients also experienced single timepoint partial responses. 52% of patients experienced stable disease (minimum of six or more weeks). A 19% disease control rate (patients without progression for greater than three months) was demonstrated. The safety profile was consistent with prior studies of glembatumumab vedotin, and there was no evidence of additive toxicity associated with the combination. Biological effects of varlilumab were consistent with prior observations and did not appear to be impacted by the addition of an ADC. Modest clinical benefit in the combination could be due to multiple factors, including potential lack of sensitivity to immunotherapy in patients with checkpoint refractory disease, many of whom progressed so rapidly that they experienced a very short duration of varlilumab treatment (median 2 doses); a possible dearth of antigen presenting cells in tumors; and the potential for immune checkpoint molecules to remain unblocked without checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Future cohorts are designed to\naddress some of these potential factors. No significant correlation between rash and outcome was observed but will continue to be monitored in future cohorts.\nTreatment of Other Indications: We have entered into a collaborative relationship with PrECOG, LLC, which represents a research network established by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), under which PrECOG, LLC, is conducting an open-label Phase 1/2 study in patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV, gpNMB-expressing, advanced or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung, who have progressed on prior platinum-based chemotherapy. This study opened to enrollment in April 2016 and is ongoing. The study includes a dose-escalation phase followed by a two-stage Phase 2 portion (Simon two-stage design). The Phase 1, dose-escalation portion of the study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of glembatumumab vedotin at varying dose levels. The first stage of the Phase 2 portion plans to enroll approximately 20 patients, and if at least two patients achieve a partial response or complete response, a second stage may enroll an additional 15 patients. The primary objective of the Phase 2 portion of the study is to assess the anti-tumor activity of glembatumumab vedotin in squamous cell lung cancer as measured by ORR. Secondary objectives of the study include analyses of safety and tolerability and further assessment of anti-tumor activity across a broad range of endpoints.\nWe have also entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, with the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, under which NCI is sponsoring a Phase 2 study of glembatumumab vedotin in uveal melanoma. The study is a single-arm, open-label study in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic uveal melanoma. The study has a two-stage design with a pre-specified activity threshold necessary in the first stage to progress enrollment to the second stage. The primary outcome measure is ORR. Secondary outcome measures include change in gpNMB expression on tumor tissue via immunohistochemistry, safety, OS and PFS. Data from this study were presented at the 9th World Congress of Melanoma in October 2017. Two (6%) objective responses were observed in 31 patients to date, and 35% of patients experienced stable disease greater than 100 days (median 5.5 months). The disease control rate (response rate + stable disease) for all patients on study was noteworthy at 61%. Median PFS was 3.2 months, and median OS was 11.8 months. For patients who experienced either a partial response or stable disease, median PFS was 5.5 months, and median OS had not yet been reached. The NCI is conducting exploratory immune correlates to provide insight into target saturation, antigen release and potential combination strategies.\nVarlilumab\nVarlilumab is a fully human monoclonal agonist antibody that binds to and activates CD27, a critical co-stimulatory molecule in the immune activation cascade. We believe varlilumab works primarily by stimulating T cells, an important component of a person's immune system, to attack cancer cells. Restricted expression and regulation of CD27 enables varlilumab specifically to activate T cells, resulting in an enhanced immune response with the potential for a favorable safety profile. In preclinical studies, varlilumab has been shown to directly kill or inhibit the growth of CD27 expressing lymphomas and leukemias in in vitro and in vivo models. We have entered into license agreements with the University of Southampton, UK for intellectual property to use anti-CD27 antibodies and with Medarex (acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS) for access to the UltiMab technology to develop and commercialize human antibodies to CD27. Varlilumab was initially studied as a single-agent to establish a safety profile and assess immunologic and clinical activity in patients with cancer, but we believe the greatest opportunity for varlilumab is as an immune activator in combination with other agents. Currently, we are focusing our efforts on a Phase 1/2 clinical trial being conducted in collaboration with BMS and their PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, Opdivo. Varlilumab has also been explored in other combination studies, including with glembatumumab vedotin, and is being studied in ongoing and planned investigator-sponsored and collaborative studies.\nSingle-Agent Phase 1 Study: In an open-label Phase 1 study of varlilumab in patients with selected malignant solid tumors or hematologic cancers, varlilumab demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and induced immunologic activity in patients that is consistent with both its proposed mechanism of action and data in preclinical models. A total of 90 patients received varlilumab in the study at multiple clinical sites in the U.S. In both the solid tumor and hematologic dose escalations, the pre-specified maximum dose level (10 mg/kg) was reached without identification of a MTD. The majority of adverse events, or AEs, related to treatment have been mild to moderate (Grade 1/2) in severity, and no significant immune-mediated adverse events typically associated with checkpoint blockade have been observed. Durable, multi-year clinical benefit was demonstrated in select patients without additional anticancer therapy, including a complete response in a patient with Hodgkin lymphoma (ongoing at last follow-up at 2.8 years) and a partial response in a patient with renal cell carcinoma (ongoing at last follow-up at 3.7 years). In addition, a patient with renal cell carcinoma that experienced significant stable disease (4+ years) subsequently achieved a partial response maintained through last follow-up at 4.6+ years without additional anticancer therapy. Twelve patients experienced stable disease up to 14 months. Final results from the study in patients with solid tumors were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in April 2017.\nPhase 1/2 Varlilumab/Opdivo\u00ae Combination Study: In 2014, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of varlilumab and Opdivo, Bristol-Myers Squibb's PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, in a Phase 1/2 study. Under the terms of this clinical trial collaboration, Bristol-Myers Squibb made a one-time payment to us of $5.0 million, and the companies amended the terms of our existing license agreement with Medarex (acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb) related to our CD27 program whereby certain future milestone payments were waived and future royalty rates were reduced that may have been due from us to Medarex. In return, Bristol-Myers Squibb was granted a time-limited right of first negotiation if we wish to out-license varlilumab. The companies also agreed to work exclusively with each other to explore anti-PD-1 antagonist antibody and anti-CD27 agonist antibody combination regimens. The clinical trial collaboration provides that the companies will share development costs and that we will be responsible for conducting the Phase 1/2 study.\nThe Phase 1/2 study was", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of several immunotherapy technologies and other cancer-targeting biologics. Our drug candidates, including antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates and other protein-based therapeutics, are derived from a broad set of complementary technologies which have the ability to engage the human immune system and/or directly inhibit tumors to treat specific types of cancer or other diseases.\nOur latest stage drug candidate, glembatumumab vedotin (also referred to as CDX-011) is a targeted antibody-drug conjugate in a randomized, Phase 2b study for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer and a Phase 2 study for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Varlilumab (also referred to as CDX-1127) is an immune modulating antibody that is designed to enhance a patient's immune response against cancer. We established proof of principle in a Phase 1 study with varlilumab, which supported the initiation of combination studies in various indications. CDX-3379, a human monoclonal antibody designed to block the activity of ErbB3 (HER3), is in Phase 2 development in combination with cetuximab for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. We also have a number of earlier stage drug candidates in clinical development, including CDX-014, an antibody-drug conjugate targeting renal and ovarian cancers; CDX-1140, a human monoclonal antibody targeted to CD40, a key activator of immune response; CDX-301, an immune cell mobilizing agent and dendritic cell growth factor; and CDX-1401, a targeted immunotherapeutic aimed at antigen presenting cells, or APCs, for cancer indications. Our drug candidates address market opportunities for which we believe current therapies are inadequate or non-existent.\nWe are building a fully integrated, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops important therapies for patients with unmet medical needs. Our program assets provide us with the strategic options to either retain full economic rights to our innovative therapies or seek favorable economic terms through advantageous commercial partnerships. This approach allows us to maximize the overall value of our technology and product portfolio while best ensuring the expeditious development of each individual product.\nThe following table reflects Celldex-sponsored clinical studies that we are actively pursuing at this time. All programs are currently fully owned by Celldex.\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Product (generic)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Indication/Field </th> <th> </th> <th>Status </th> <th> </th> <th>Sponsor </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Glembatumumab vedotin\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Triple negative breast cancer </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 2b </td> <td> </td> <td>Celldex </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Glembatumumab vedotin\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Metastatic melanoma (single-agent, with varlilumab or CPI(1) or CDX-301) </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>Celldex </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Varlilumab\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Multiple solid tumors (with Opdivo\u00ae) </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>Celldex(2) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CDX-3379\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Head and neck squamous cell cancer (with Erbitux\u00ae) </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>Celldex </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CDX-014\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Renal cell and ovarian carcinomas </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>Celldex </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CDX-1140\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Multiple solid tumors </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>Celldex </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)checkpoint inhibitor;\n(2)BMS collaboration\nWe also routinely work with external parties, such as government agencies, to collaboratively advance our drug candidates. The following pipeline reflects clinical trials of our drug candidates being actively pursued by outside organizations. In addition to the studies listed below, we also have an\nInvestigator Initiated Research (IIR) program with six studies ongoing with our drug candidates and additional studies currently under consideration.\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Product (generic)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Indication/Field </th> <th> </th> <th>Status </th> <th> </th> <th>Sponsor </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Glembatumumab vedotin </td> <td> </td> <td>Uveal melanoma </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>NCI (CRADA) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Glembatumumab vedotin </td> <td> </td> <td>Squamous cell lung cancer </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>PrECOG, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>CDX-1401/CDX-301 </td> <td> </td> <td>Malignant melanoma </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>NCI (CRADA) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>CDX-1401/Tecentriq\u00ae/SGI-110 </td> <td> </td> <td>Ovarian cancer </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>NCI (CRADA) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Varlilumab/Opdivo\u00ae </td> <td> </td> <td>B-cell malignancies </td> <td> </td> <td>Phase 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>NCI (CRADA) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties. Completion of clinical trials may take several years or more, and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a drug candidate. It is not unusual for the clinical development of these types of drug candidates to each take five years or more, and for total development costs to exceed $100 million for each drug candidate. We estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following timelines:\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Clinical Phase\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Estimated\nCompletion\nPeriod </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Phase 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 2 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Phase 2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Phase 3\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 5 Years </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022 the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial;\n\u2022 the duration of patient follow-up that seems appropriate in view of results;\n\u2022 the number of clinical sites included in the trials;\n\u2022 the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects; and\n\u2022 the efficacy and safety profile of the drug candidate.\nWe test potential drug candidates in numerous preclinical studies for safety, toxicology and immunogenicity. We may then conduct multiple clinical trials for each drug candidate. As we obtain results from trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain drug candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising drug candidates.\nAn element of our business strategy is to pursue the research and development of a broad portfolio of drug candidates. This is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures. To the extent we are unable to maintain a broad range of drug candidates, our dependence on the success of one or a few drug candidates increases.\nRegulatory approval is required before we can market our drug candidates as therapeutic products. In order to proceed to subsequent clinical trial stages and to ultimately achieve regulatory approval, the regulatory agency must conclude that our clinical data are safe and effective. Historically, the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials (through Phase 2) have often not been predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials. A number of new drugs and biologics have shown promising results in early clinical trials but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals.\nFurthermore, our business strategy includes the option of entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our drug candidates. In the event that third parties take over the clinical trial process for one of our drug candidates, the estimated completion date would largely be under control of that third party rather than us. We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products, if any, will be subject to future collaborative arrangements, in whole or in part, and how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements. Our programs may also benefit from subsidies, grants, contracts or government or agency-sponsored studies that could reduce our development costs.\nAs a result of the uncertainties discussed above, among others, it is difficult to accurately estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when, if ever, and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product. Our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements, when appropriate, could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity. These uncertainties could force us to seek additional, external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy. Our inability to raise additional capital, or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us, would jeopardize the future success of our business.\nDuring the past five years through December 31, 2017, we incurred an aggregate of $470.9 million in research and development expenses. The following table indicates the amount incurred for each of our significant research programs and for other identified research and development activities during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The amounts disclosed in the following table reflect direct research and development costs, license fees associated with the underlying technology and an allocation of indirect research and development costs to each program.\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(In thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Glembatumumab vedotin\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>36,873 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>30,156 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>19,124 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Varlilumab\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,940 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,484 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CDX-3379\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CDX-014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,534 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,724 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CDX-1140\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,909 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CDX-1401\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,385 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CDX-301\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,053 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,206 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Anti-KIT Program\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TAM\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>438 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rintega\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,038 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Programs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,265 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,210 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total R&D Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>96,171 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>102,726 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>100,171 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nClinical Development Programs\nGlembatumumab Vedotin\nGlembatumumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, that consists of a fully human monoclonal antibody, CR011, linked to a potent cell-killing drug, monomethyl auristatin E, or MMAE. The CR011 antibody specifically targets glycoprotein NMB, referred to as gpNMB, that is over-expressed in a variety of cancers including breast cancer, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, uveal melanoma and osteosarcoma, among others. The ADC technology, comprised of MMAE and a stable linker system for attaching it to CR011, was licensed from Seattle Genetics, Inc. and is the same\nas that used in the marketed product Adcetris\u00ae. The ADC is designed to be stable in the bloodstream. Following intravenous administration, glembatumumab vedotin targets and binds to gpNMB, and upon internalization into the targeted cell, glembatumumab vedotin is designed to release MMAE from CR011 to produce a cell-killing effect. Glembatumumab vedotin is being studied across multiple indications in company-sponsored trials and in collaborative studies with external parties. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has granted fast track designation to glembatumumab vedotin for the treatment of advanced, refractory/resistant gpNMB-expressing breast cancer. A companion diagnostic is in development for certain indications, and we expect that, if necessary, such a companion diagnostic must be approved by the FDA or certain other foreign regulatory agencies before glembatumumab vedotin may be commercialized in those indications.\nTreatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer: Glembatumumab vedotin has been evaluated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in multiple studies including a single-arm Phase 1/2 study (Journal of Clinical Oncology, September 2014); a randomized, controlled Phase 2b study compared to Investigator's Choice chemotherapy in patients with gpNMB-positive MBC called EMERGE (Journal of Clinical Oncology, April 2015); and the ongoing randomized, controlled Phase 2b study in patients with triple negative, gpNMB overexpressing breast cancer, called METRIC. We expect to report topline primary endpoint data from the METRIC study during the second quarter of 2018.\nThe most recent data presented for glembatumumab vedotin in breast cancer are from the EMERGE study, the randomized, multi-center Phase 2b study in 124 patients with heavily pre-treated, advanced, gpNMB-positive breast cancer. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either glembatumumab vedotin or single-agent Investigator's Choice chemotherapy. Patients randomized to receive Investigator's Choice were allowed to cross over to receive glembatumumab vedotin following disease progression. Activity endpoints included response rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The final study results, as shown below, suggested that glembatumumab vedotin induced significant response rates compared to currently available therapies in patient subsets with advanced, refractory breast cancers with high gpNMB expression (expression in at least 25% of tumor cells) and in patients with triple negative breast cancer. The OS and PFS of patients treated with glembatumumab vedotin were also observed to be greatest in patients with high gpNMB expression and, in particular, in patients with triple negative breast cancer who also had high gpNMB expression. Adverse events prominent with the glembatumumab vedotin arm included rash and peripheral neuropathy, while hematologic toxicity was more frequent and severe in the Investigator's Choice arm.\nEMERGE: Overall Response Rate and Disease Control Data (Intent-to-Treat Population)\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>High gpNMB Expression </th> <th> </th> <th>Triple Negative\nand gpNMB\nOver-Expression </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Glembatumumab\nVedotin </th> <th> </th> <th>Investigator's\nChoice </th> <th> </th> <th>Glembatumumab\nVedotin </th> <th> </th> <th>Investigator's\nChoice </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(n=23) </th> <th> </th> <th>(n=11) </th> <th> </th> <th>(n=10) </th> <th> </th> <th>(n=6) </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Response Rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Disease Control Rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTumor response assessed by RECIST 1.1, inclusive of response observed at a single time point.\nEMERGE: Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) Data\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>High gpNMB Expression </th> <th> </th> <th>Triple Negative\nand gpNMB\nOver-Expression </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Glembatumumab\nVedotin </th> <th> </th> <th>Investigator's\nChoice </th> <th> </th> <th>Glembatumumab\nVedotin </th> <th> </th> <th>Investigator's\nChoice </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMedian PFS (months)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>p=0.18 </td> <td> </td> <td>p=0.0017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Median OS (months)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 10.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n5.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> 10.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n5.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>p=0.31 </td> <td> </td> <td>p=0.003\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn December 2013, we initiated METRIC, a randomized, controlled (2:1) Phase 2b study of glembatumumab vedotin versus Xeloda\u00ae in patients with triple negative breast cancer that over-expresses gpNMB. Clinical trial study sites were opened to enrollment across the U.S., Canada, Australia and the European Union. The METRIC protocol was amended in late 2014 based on feedback from clinical investigators conducting the study that the eligibility criteria for study entry were limiting their ability to enroll patients they felt were clinically appropriate. In addition, we had spoken to country-specific members of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and believed an opportunity existed to expand the study into the EU. The amendment expanded patient entry criteria to position it for the possibility of full marketing approval with global regulators, including the EMA, and to support improved enrollment in the study. The primary endpoint of the study is PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the earlier of disease progression or death due to any cause. PFS is an established endpoint for full approval registration studies in this patient population in both the U.S. and the EU. The sample size (n=300) and the secondary endpoint of OS remained unchanged. Since implementation of these changes, both the FDA and central European regulatory authorities have reviewed the protocol design, and we believe the METRIC study could potentially support marketing approval in both the U.S. and Europe dependent upon data results and review.\nEnrollment (n=327) in METRIC was completed in August 2017. The study calls for 203 progression events for evaluation of the primary endpoint, which will be assessed based on an independent, central reading of patient scans. The sum of the data, including the secondary endpoints of response rate, OS, DOR and safety, will be important in assessing clinical benefit. Based on the current rate of progression events in the study, the Company projects that topline primary endpoint data should be available in the second quarter of 2018.\nEfforts to ensure delivery of manufactured drug that is ready for commercialization and a companion diagnostic are underway. While we have made and continue to make progress on these fronts, we have made the decision to stage some of the more costly work in these areas to begin after we have received results from the study. While this step will extend the timeline to complete our regulatory submissions, we believe this is the most prudent use of our funds as we seek to advance our pipeline overall. Assuming positive data, we plan to work with the FDA on a regulatory strategy that would support submitting a Biologics License Application (BLA) in the second half of 2019.\nTreatment of Metastatic Melanoma: Glembatumumab vedotin has been evaluated for the treatment of unresectable stage III or IV metastatic melanoma in two studies including a single-arm Phase 1/2 open-label study and an ongoing multi-cohort Phase 2 study. Results from the Phase 1/2 study were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in September 2014.\nThe most recent data for glembatumumab vedotin in metastatic melanoma are from the ongoing Phase 2 study. This study currently includes four single arm cohorts: (1) a single-agent cohort (enrollment completed; data presented at ASCO 2017), (2) a combination cohort with varlilumab (enrollment completed; data presented at SITC 2017), (3) a combination cohort with an approved\ncheckpoint inhibitor (i.e., Opdivo\u00ae or Keytruda\u00ae) following progression on the checkpoint inhibitor alone (enrollment completed; follow-up continues), and (4) a combination cohort with CDX-301 (enrollment ongoing).\nThe primary endpoint for each cohort is ORR, except the fourth cohort which is assessing safety and tolerability in anticipation of additional combinations. Secondary endpoints include analyses of PFS, DOR, OS, retrospective investigation of whether the anticancer activity of glembatumumab vedotin is dependent upon the degree of gpNMB expression in tumor tissue and safety of both the monotherapy and combination regimens.\nWe presented mature data from the single-agent cohort in an oral presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June 2017. The cohort enrolled 62 evaluable patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma. All patients had been heavily pre-treated (median prior therapies = 3; range 1-8) and had progressed during or after checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and almost all patients had received both ipilimumab (n=58; 94%) and anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 (n=58; 94%) therapy. Twelve patients presented with BRAF mutation, and fifteen had prior treatment with BRAF or BRAF/MEK targeted agents. Median OS for all patients was 9.0 months (95% CI: 6.1, 13.0). The primary endpoint of the cohort (threshold of 6 or more objective responses in 52 evaluable patients) was exceeded. 7 of 62 (11%) patients experienced a confirmed response. One patient experienced a complete response (CR), and six patients experienced partial responses (PR). An additional three patients also experienced single timepoint PRs. The median DOR was 6.0 months. A 52% disease control rate (patients without progression for greater than three months) was demonstrated, and median PFS for all patients was 4.4 months. Consistent with previous studies in melanoma and breast cancer, early development of rash was associated with greater clinical benefit, including more prolonged PFS and OS. The safety profile was consistent with prior studies of glembatumumab vedotin with rash, neutropenia and neuropathy experienced as the most significant adverse events. Pre-treatment tumor tissue was available for 59 patients. All samples were gpNMB positive, and 78% of patients had tumors with 100% of their epithelial cells expressing gpNMB. Given both the high level of expression and the intensity of expression across this patient population, identifying a potential population for gpNMB enrichment is not feasible; therefore, all patients with metastatic melanoma could be evaluated as potential candidates for treatment with glembatumumab vedotin in future studies.\nData from the second cohort, combining glembatumumab vedotin and varlilumab, were presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer's (SITC) 32nd Annual Meeting in November 2017. The cohort enrolled 34 patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma. All patients had been heavily pre-treated (median prior therapies = 3; range 1-8) and had progressed during or after checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy (median prior CPI therapies = 2; range 1-4). Almost all patients had received ipilimumab (n=26; 76%) and/or anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 (n=34; 100%) therapy. Nine patients presented with BRAF mutation, and eleven had prior treatment with BRAF or BRAF/MEK targeted agents. Median PFS for all patients was 2.6 months (95% CI: 1.4, 2.8), and median OS for all patients was 6.4 months (95% CI: 3.2, 8.3). One of 31 patients eligible for response evaluation experienced a confirmed partial response (3%), and an additional two patients also experienced single timepoint partial responses. 52% of patients experienced stable disease (minimum of six or more weeks). A 19% disease control rate (patients without progression for greater than three months) was demonstrated. The safety profile was consistent with prior studies of glembatumumab vedotin, and there was no evidence of additive toxicity associated with the combination. Biological effects of varlilumab were consistent with prior observations and did not appear to be impacted by the addition of an ADC. Modest clinical benefit in the combination could be due to multiple factors, including potential lack of sensitivity to immunotherapy in patients with checkpoint refractory disease, many of whom progressed so rapidly that they experienced a very short duration of varlilumab treatment (median 2 doses); a possible dearth of antigen presenting cells in tumors; and the potential for immune checkpoint molecules to remain unblocked without checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Future cohorts are designed to\naddress some of these potential factors. No significant correlation between rash and outcome was observed but will continue to be monitored in future cohorts.\nTreatment of Other Indications: We have entered into a collaborative relationship with PrECOG, LLC, which represents a research network established by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), under which PrECOG, LLC, is conducting an open-label Phase 1/2 study in patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV, gpNMB-expressing, advanced or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung, who have progressed on prior platinum-based chemotherapy. This study opened to enrollment in April 2016 and is ongoing. The study includes a dose-escalation phase followed by a two-stage Phase 2 portion (Simon two-stage design). The Phase 1, dose-escalation portion of the study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of glembatumumab vedotin at varying dose levels. The first stage of the Phase 2 portion plans to enroll approximately 20 patients, and if at least two patients achieve a partial response or complete response, a second stage may enroll an additional 15 patients. The primary objective of the Phase 2 portion of the study is to assess the anti-tumor activity of glembatumumab vedotin in squamous cell lung cancer as measured by ORR. Secondary objectives of the study include analyses of safety and tolerability and further assessment of anti-tumor activity across a broad range of endpoints.\nWe have also entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, with the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, under which NCI is sponsoring a Phase 2 study of glembatumumab vedotin in uveal melanoma. The study is a single-arm, open-label study in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic uveal melanoma. The study has a two-stage design with a pre-specified activity threshold necessary in the first stage to progress enrollment to the second stage. The primary outcome measure is ORR. Secondary outcome measures include change in gpNMB expression on tumor tissue via immunohistochemistry, safety, OS and PFS. Data from this study were presented at the 9th World Congress of Melanoma in October 2017. Two (6%) objective responses were observed in 31 patients to date, and 35% of patients experienced stable disease greater than 100 days (median 5.5 months). The disease control rate (response rate + stable disease) for all patients on study was noteworthy at 61%. Median PFS was 3.2 months, and median OS was 11.8 months. For patients who experienced either a partial response or stable disease, median PFS was 5.5 months, and median OS had not yet been reached. The NCI is conducting exploratory immune correlates to provide insight into target saturation, antigen release and potential combination strategies.\nVarlilumab\nVarlilumab is a fully human monoclonal agonist antibody that binds to and activates CD27, a critical co-stimulatory molecule in the immune activation cascade. We believe varlilumab works primarily by stimulating T cells, an important component of a person's immune system, to attack cancer cells. Restricted expression and regulation of CD27 enables varlilumab specifically to activate T cells, resulting in an enhanced immune response with the potential for a favorable safety profile. In preclinical studies, varlilumab has been shown to directly kill or inhibit the growth of CD27 expressing lymphomas and leukemias in in vitro and in vivo models. We have entered into license agreements with the University of Southampton, UK for intellectual property to use anti-CD27 antibodies and with Medarex (acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS) for access to the UltiMab technology to develop and commercialize human antibodies to CD27. Varlilumab was initially studied as a single-agent to establish a safety profile and assess immunologic and clinical activity in patients with cancer, but we believe the greatest opportunity for varlilumab is as an immune activator in combination with other agents. Currently, we are focusing our efforts on a Phase 1/2 clinical trial being conducted in collaboration with BMS and their PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, Opdivo. Varlilumab has also been explored in other combination studies, including with glembatumumab vedotin, and is being studied in ongoing and planned investigator-sponsored and collaborative studies.\nSingle-Agent Phase 1 Study: In an open-label Phase 1 study of varlilumab in patients with selected malignant solid tumors or hematologic cancers, varlilumab demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and induced immunologic activity in patients that is consistent with both its proposed mechanism of action and data in preclinical models. A total of 90 patients received varlilumab in the study at multiple clinical sites in the U.S. In both the solid tumor and hematologic dose escalations, the pre-specified maximum dose level (10 mg/kg) was reached without identification of a MTD. The majority of adverse events, or AEs, related to treatment have been mild to moderate (Grade 1/2) in severity, and no significant immune-mediated adverse events typically associated with checkpoint blockade have been observed. Durable, multi-year clinical benefit was demonstrated in select patients without additional anticancer therapy, including a complete response in a patient with Hodgkin lymphoma (ongoing at last follow-up at 2.8 years) and a partial response in a patient with renal cell carcinoma (ongoing at last follow-up at 3.7 years). In addition, a patient with renal cell carcinoma that experienced significant stable disease (4+ years) subsequently achieved a partial response maintained through last follow-up at 4.6+ years without additional anticancer therapy. Twelve patients experienced stable disease up to 14 months. Final results from the study in patients with solid tumors were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in April 2017.\nPhase 1/2 Varlilumab/Opdivo\u00ae Combination Study: In 2014, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of varlilumab and Opdivo, Bristol-Myers Squibb's PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, in a Phase 1/2 study. Under the terms of this clinical trial collaboration, Bristol-Myers Squibb made a one-time payment to us of $5.0 million, and the companies amended the terms of our existing license agreement with Medarex (acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb) related to our CD27 program whereby certain future milestone payments were waived and future royalty rates were reduced that may have been due from us to Medarex. In return, Bristol-Myers Squibb was granted a time-limited right of first negotiation if we wish to out-license varlilumab. The companies also agreed to work exclusively with each other to explore anti-PD-1 antagonist antibody and anti-CD27 agonist antibody combination regimens. The clinical trial collaboration provides that the companies will share development costs and that we will be responsible for conducting the Phase 1/2 study.\nThe Phase 1/2 study was"}
