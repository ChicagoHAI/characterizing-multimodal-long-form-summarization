MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nAccounting guidance requires that we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the positions will not be sustained when challenged by taxing authorities. We have no reason to believe that we have any future obligations associated with unrecognized tax benefits, therefore, as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, we have not recorded any liabilities related to uncertain tax positions. Any significant changes to the estimates and judgments with respect to the interpretations, timing or deductibility could result in a material change to earnings and cash flows.\nTo the extent that NJNG invests in property that qualifies for ITCs, the ITC is deferred and amortized to income over the life of the equipment in accordance with regulatory treatment. For our unregulated subsidiaries, we recognize ITCs as a reduction to income tax expense when the property is placed in service.\nTo the extent that the Company invests in property that qualifies for PTCs, the PTC is recognized as a reduction to current federal income tax expense as the PTCs are generated through the production activities of the assets.\nChanges to the federal statutes related to ITCs and PTCs, which have the effect of reducing or eliminating the credits, could have a negative impact on earnings and cash flows.\nEnvironmental Costs\nAt the end of each fiscal year, NJNG, with the assistance of an independent consulting firm, updates the environmental review of its MGP sites, including its potential liability for investigation and remedial action. From this review, NJNG estimates expenditures necessary to remediate and monitor these MGP sites. As of September 30, 2017, NJNG estimated these expenditures will range from approximately $117.6 million to $205.2 million. NJNG's estimate of these liabilities is developed from then currently available facts, existing technology and current laws and regulations.\nIn accordance with accounting standards for contingencies, NJNG's policy is to record a liability when it is probable that the cost will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated. NJNG will determine a range of liabilities and will record the most likely amount. If no point within the range is more likely than any other, NJNG will accrue the lower end of the range. Since we believe that recovery of these expenditures, as well as related litigation costs, is possible through the regulatory process, we have recorded a regulatory asset corresponding to the related accrued liability. Accordingly, NJNG recorded an MGP remediation liability and a corresponding regulatory asset of $149 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which is based on the most likely amount. This was reduced from $172 million in fiscal 2016, due to the completion of remediation work at certain sites and a reduction to the remediation scope of work at another site.\nThe actual costs to be incurred by NJNG are dependent upon several factors, including final determination of remedial action, changing technologies and governmental regulations, the ultimate ability of other responsible parties to pay, as well as the potential impact of any litigation and any insurance recoveries. As of September 30, 2017 and 2016, $28.5 million and $19.6 million of previously incurred remediation costs, net of recoveries from customers and insurance proceeds received, are included in regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively.\nIf there are changes in the regulatory position surrounding these costs, or should actual expenditures vary significantly from estimates in that these costs are disallowed for recovery by the BPU, such costs would be charged to income in the period of such determination.\nPostemployment Employee Benefits\nOur costs of providing postemployment employee benefits are dependent upon numerous factors, including actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Postemployment employee benefit costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age, compensation levels and employment periods, the level of contributions made to the plans, changes in long-term interest rates and the return on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans or healthcare legislation may also impact current and future postemployment employee benefit costs. Postemployment employee benefit costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, changes in mortality tables, health care cost trends and discount rates used in determining the PBO. In determining the PBO and cost amounts, assumptions can change from period to period and could result in material changes to net postemployment employee benefit periodic costs and the related liability recognized by us.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nOur postemployment employee benefit plan assets consist primarily of U.S. equity securities, international equity securities and fixed-income investments, with a targeted allocation of 40 percent, 20 percent and 40 percent, respectively. Fluctuations in actual market returns, as well as changes in interest rates, may result in increased or decreased postemployment employee benefit costs in future periods. Postemployment employee benefit expenses are included in O&M expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following is a summary of a sensitivity analysis for each actuarial assumption:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension Plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actuarial Assumptions\n</td> <td>Increase/\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>Estimated\nIncrease/(Decrease) on PBO\n(Thousands)\n</td> <td>Estimated\nIncrease/(Decrease) to Expense\n(Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38,398\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,875\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>(1.00\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,493\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>(1.00\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Postemployment Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actuarial Assumptions\n</td> <td>Increase/\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>Estimated\nIncrease/(Decrease) on PBO\n(Thousands)\n</td> <td>Estimated\nIncrease/(Decrease) to Expense\n(Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25,977\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,447\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>(1.00\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(615\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>(1.00\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actuarial Assumptions\n</td> <td>Increase/\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>Estimated\nIncrease/(Decrease) on PBO\n(Thousands)\n</td> <td>Estimated\nIncrease/(Decrease) to Expense\n(Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health care cost trend rate\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health care cost trend rate\n</td> <td>(1.00\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25,466\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,624\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn October 1, 2016, we changed our approach used to measure the service and interest cost components of its net periodic benefit costs. Previously, the Company estimated service cost and interest cost based on a single weighted-average discount rate from the yield curve used to measure its projected benefit obligation. Effective October 1, 2016, we determine our service and interest cost based upon duration specific spot rates that are aligned to each year's future benefit payments. Under the new approach, net periodic benefit costs will be lower during periods of low interest rates and upward-sloping yield curves. Conversely, in a downward sloping-yield curve environment, costs could increase. Refer to Note 11. Employee Benefit Plans in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our change in method.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe recognize AROs related to the costs associated with cutting and capping NJNG's main and service gas distribution mains, which is required by New Jersey law when taking such gas distribution mains out of service. We also recognize AROs associated with Clean Energy Ventures' solar and wind assets when there are decommissioning provisions in lease agreements that require removal of the asset at the end of the lease term.\nAROs are initially recognized when the legal obligation to retire an asset has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The discounted fair value is recognized as an ARO liability with a corresponding amount capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the underlying asset. The obligation is subsequently accreted to the future value of the expected retirement cost and the corresponding asset retirement cost is depreciated over the life of the related asset. Accretion expense associated with Clean Energy Ventures' ARO is recognized as a component of operations and maintenance expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior to October 1, 2016, accretion amounts associated with NJNG's ARO were not reflected as an expense, but rather were deferred as a regulatory asset and netted against NJNG's regulatory liabilities for presentation purposes. Through NJNG's new base rates settlement, effective October 1, 2016, accretion is recognized as part of its depreciation expense and the corresponding regulatory asset and liability will be shown gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nEstimating future removal costs requires management to make significant judgments because most of the removal obligations span long time frames and removal may be conditioned upon future events. Asset removal technologies are also constantly changing, which makes it difficult to estimate removal costs. Accordingly, inherent in the estimate of our AROs are various assumptions including the ultimate settlement date, expected cash outflows, inflation rates, credit-adjusted risk-free rates and consideration of potential outcomes where settlement of the ARO can be conditioned upon events. In the latter case, we develop possible retirement scenarios and assign probabilities based on management's reasonable judgment and knowledge of industry practice. Accordingly, AROs are subject to change.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recently issued accounting standards.\nManagement's Overview\nConsolidated\nNJR is an energy services holding company providing retail natural gas service in New Jersey and wholesale natural gas and related energy services to customers in the United States and Canada. In addition, we invest in clean energy projects, midstream assets and provide various repair, sales and installations services. A more detailed description of our organizational structure can be found in Item 1. Business.\nReporting Segments\nWe have four primary reporting segments as presented in the chart below:\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nIn addition to our four reporting segments, we have non-utility operations that either provide corporate support services or do not meet the criteria to be treated as a separate reporting segment. These operations, which comprise Home Services and Other, include: appliance repair services, sales and installations at NJRHS; and commercial real estate holdings at CR&R.\nA summary of our consolidated results in net income and assets by reporting segment and operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, is as follows:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Income\n</td> <td>Assets\n</td> <td>Net Income\n</td> <td>Assets\n</td> <td>Net Income\n</td> <td>Assets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural Gas Distribution\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,519,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,517,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,305,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clean Energy Ventures\n</td> <td>24,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>771,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>665,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>504,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy Services\n</td> <td>476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>398,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>327,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>260,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Midstream\n</td> <td>12,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>232,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home Services and Other\n</td> <td>6,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intercompany (1)\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(108,295\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(87,899\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(672\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(56,729\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,928,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,718,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,284,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Consists of transactions between subsidiaries that are eliminated in consolidation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Income\nThe primary drivers of the changes noted above, which are described in more detail in the individual segment discussions, are discussed below.\nThe increase in net income of $393,000 during fiscal 2017, compared with fiscal 2016, was primarily driven by increased gross margin at our Natural Gas Distribution segment due primarily to increased base rates which were effective October 1, 2016, increased other income at Home Services and Other due to the sale of available for sale securities and increased equity in earnings of affiliates at Midstream. These increases were partially offset by decreased operating income at Energy Services due primarily to a decrease of $16.4 million related to changes in the value of financial hedges and a decrease at Clean Energy Ventures due primarily to increased depreciation, operating and interest expenses, partially offset by increased revenues and increased PTCs.\nThe decrease in net income of $49.3 million during fiscal 2016, compared with fiscal 2015, was primarily driven by a decrease at Energy Services related to lower operating income due primarily to a decrease of $59.7 million related to changes in the value of financial hedges. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $8.3 million at Clean Energy Ventures due primarily to operating revenue related to higher SREC and electricity sales, partially offset by increased costs related to depreciation, O&M and interest expense.\nAssets\nThe increase in assets during fiscal 2017, compared with fiscal 2016, was due primarily to additional solar expenditures at Clean Energy Ventures, the acquisition of Talen's wholesale and retail energy contract assets at Energy Services, increased PennEast capital contributions and an increase in the market value of our DM Common Units at Midstream, along with additional utility plant expenditures at our Natural Gas Distribution segment. The increase in assets during fiscal 2016, compared with fiscal 2015, was due primarily to additional utility plant expenditures at Natural Gas Distribution and additional solar expenditures at Clean Energy Ventures, as well as increased broker margin and gas in storage at Energy Services.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur management uses NFE, a non-GAAP financial measure, when evaluating our operating results. Energy Services economically hedges its natural gas inventory with financial derivative instruments. NFE is a measure of the earnings based on eliminating timing differences surrounding the recognition of certain gains or losses, to effectively match the earnings effects of the economic hedges with the physical sale of gas and, therefore, eliminates the impact of volatility to GAAP earnings associated with the derivative instruments. To the extent we utilize forwards, futures, or other derivatives to hedge forecasted SREC production, unrealized gains and losses are also eliminated for NFE purposes.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or a replacement of, the comparable GAAP measure and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results. The following is a reconciliation of consolidated net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to NFE:\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Services and Other, as previously discussed, partially offset by lower financial margin at Energy Services due primarily to lower sales volumes and fewer market opportunities and the decrease at Clean Energy Ventures, as previously discussed.\nThe decrease in NFE during fiscal 2016, compared with fiscal 2015, was driven primarily by decreased financial margin at Energy Services due primarily to lower volatility and narrower price spreads resulting from the record warm winter weather primarily across the eastern United States, partially offset by lower taxes and O&M, partially offset by higher NFE at Clean Energy Ventures due primarily to increase in SREC and energy sales.\nNatural Gas Distribution Segment\nOverview\nOur Natural Gas Distribution segment is comprised of NJNG, a natural gas utility that provides regulated retail natural gas service in central and northern New Jersey to approximately 529,800 residential and commercial customers in its service territory and also participates in the off-system sales and capacity release markets. The business is subject to various risks, which can negatively impact customer growth, operating and financing costs, fluctuations in commodity prices and customer conservation efforts. These risks include, but are not limited to, adverse economic conditions, customer usage, certain regulatory actions, environmental remediation and severe weather conditions. It is often difficult to predict the impact of events or trends associated with these risks.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nIn addition, NJNG's business is seasonal by nature, as weather conditions directly influence the volume of natural gas delivered to customers on an annual basis. Specifically, customer demand substantially increases during the winter months when natural gas is used for heating purposes. As a result, NJNG receives most of its natural gas distribution revenues during the first and second fiscal quarters and is subject to variations in earnings and working capital during the year.\nAs a regulated company, NJNG is required to recognize the impact of regulatory decisions on its financial statements. See Note 4. Regulation in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion on regulatory actions, including filings related to programs and associated expenditures, as well as rate requests related to recovery of capital investments and operating costs.\nNJNG's operations are managed with the goal of providing safe and reliable service, growing its customer base, diversifying its gross margin, promoting clean energy programs and mitigating the risks discussed above through several key initiatives, including:\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>earning a reasonable rate of return on the investments in its natural gas distribution and transmission businesses, as well as timely recovery of all prudently incurred costs to provide safe and reliable service throughout NJNG's territory;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>continuing to invest in the safety and integrity of its infrastructure;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>managing its customer growth rate, which NJNG expects will be approximately 1.7 percent annually through fiscal 2019;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maintaining a collaborative relationship with the BPU on regulatory initiatives, including:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n- planning and authorization of infrastructure investments;\n- pursuing rate and regulatory strategies to stabilize and decouple margin, including CIP;\n- utilizing BGSS incentive programs through BPU-approved mechanisms to reduce gas costs and generate margin; and\n- administering and promoting NJNG's BPU-approved SAVEGREEN Project;\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>managing the volatility of wholesale natural gas prices through a hedging program designed to keep customers' BGSS rates as stable as possible; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>working with the NJDEP and BPU to manage its financial obligations related to remediation activities associated with its former MGP sites.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBase Rate Case\nIn September 2016, the BPU approved NJNG's base rate case, effective October 2016, which included the following:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase in base rates in the amount of $45 million.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nInfrastructure projects\nNJNG has significant annual capital expenditures associated with the management of its natural gas distribution and transmission system, including new utility plant associated with customer growth and its associated PIM and infrastructure programs.\nBelow is a summary of NJNG's capital expenditures, including accruals and estimates for expected investments over the next two fiscal years:\nEstimated capital expenditures are reviewed on a regular basis and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory oversight, environmental regulations, unforeseen events and the ability to access capital.\nSAFE and NJ RISE\nNJNG continues to implement BPU-approved infrastructure projects that are designed to enhance the reliability and integrity of NJNG's gas distribution system.\nThe BPU approved recovery of SAFE I capital investments through September 30, 2016, and approved the rate mechanism and extension of SAFE II for an additional five years to replace the remaining unprotected steel mains and services from its natural gas distribution system at an estimated cost of approximately $200 million, excluding AFUDC. The accelerated cost recovery methodology for the $157.5 million associated with the extension of SAFE II was approved in NJNG's new base rates. The remaining $42.5 million in capital expenditures will be requested for recovery in a future base rate case.\nThe BPU approved the recovery of NJNG's NJ RISE capital infrastructure program, which consists of six capital investment projects estimated to cost $102.5 million, excluding AFUDC, for gas distribution storm hardening and mitigation projects, along with associated depreciation expense. These system enhancements are intended to minimize service impacts during extreme weather events to customers that live in the most storm prone areas of NJNG's service territory. Recovery of NJ RISE investments through June 30, 2016, is included in NJNG's base rates.\nOn March 30, 2017, NJNG filed its annual petition with the BPU requesting a base rate increase for the recovery of NJ RISE and SAFE II capital investment costs, with a weighted cost of capital of 6.9 percent including a return on equity of 9.75 percent, related to the period ending June 30, 2017, based on estimates, pursuant to the September 2016 base rate case. On July 20,\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\n2017, NJNG filed an update to this petition with actuals, requesting a $4.1 million annual increase in recoveries, which was approved by the BPU, effective October 1, 2017.\nNGV Advantage\nIn June 2012, the BPU approved a pilot program for NJNG to invest up to $10 million to build NGV refueling stations. The NGV program was authorized by the BPU to earn an overall weighted average cost of capital of 7.1 percent, including a return on equity of 10.3 percent. A portion of the proceeds from the utilization of the compressed natural gas equipment, along with any available federal and state incentives, will be credited back to customers to offset a portion of the cost of the NGV investment. All three of the NGV stations are open to the public and NJNG is recovering its costs through base rates effective October 2016.\nLiquefaction/LNG\nIn June 2016, NJNG's Liquefaction facility became operational and allows NJNG to convert natural gas into LNG to fill its existing LNG storage tanks. Costs for this project along with other plant upgrades were approximately $36.5 million and are being recovered through NJNG's new base rates effective October 2016.\nSouthern Reliability Link\nThe SRL is an approximate 30-mile, 30-inch transmission main designed to support improved system reliability and integrity in the southern portion of NJNG's service territory, estimated to cost between $180 million and $200 million. In January 2016, the BPU issued an order approving NJNG's modified, proposed SRL pipeline installation, operation and route selection. In March 2016, the BPU issued an order designating the SRL route and exempting the SRL from municipal land use ordinances, regulations, permits and license requirements. In February 2017, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection issued a permit authorizing construction of the SRL within the jurisdiction of the Coastal Area Facility Review Act, as well as a Freshwater Wetlands permit. On September 14, 2017, the NJ Pinelands Commission approved construction of the SRL as being compliant with the Commission's Comprehensive Management Plan. All approvals and permits have been appealed by third parties. Once the final road opening permits and easements are secured, construction is expected to begin, with an estimated in-service date during the first quarter of fiscal 2019.\nCustomer growth\nIn conducting NJNG's business, management focuses on factors it believes may have significant influence on its future financial results. NJNG's policy is to work with all stakeholders, including customers, regulators and policymakers, to achieve favorable results. These factors include the rate of NJNG's customer growth in its service territory, which can be influenced by political and regulatory policies, the delivered cost of natural gas compared with competing fuels, interest rates and general economic and business conditions.\nNJNG's total customers as of September 30, include the following:\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Firm customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential\n</td> <td>460,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>448,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>437,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial, industrial & other\n</td> <td>26,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential transport\n</td> <td>32,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial transport\n</td> <td>10,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total firm customers\n</td> <td>529,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>521,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>512,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total customers\n</td> <td>529,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>521,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>512,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring fiscal 2017, NJNG added 9,126 new customers, which represents a new customer growth rate of approximately 1.7 percent. During that same time period, NJNG converted 662 existing customers to natural gas heat and other services. This customer growth, as well as commercial customers who switched from interruptible to firm natural gas service, will contribute approximately $5.5 million, on an annualized basis, to utility gross margin. NJNG also added 8,170 and 7,858 new customers and converted 644\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nand 636 existing customers to natural gas heat and other services during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nIn addition, NJNG currently expects to add approximately 26,000 to 28,000 new customers during the three-year period of fiscal 2018 to 2020. NJNG's estimates are based on information from municipalities and developers, as well as external industry analysts and management's experience. NJNG estimates that approximately 60 percent of the growth will come from new construction markets and 40 percent from customer conversions to natural gas from other fuel sources. This new customer and conversion growth would increase utility gross margin under NJNG's base rates by approximately $5.3 million annually, as calculated under NJNG's CIP tariff. See the Natural Gas Distribution Segment Operating Results section that follows for a definition and further discussion of utility gross margin.\nSAVEGREEN\nSAVEGREEN conducts home energy audits and provides various grants, incentives and financing alternatives, which are designed to encourage the installation of high efficiency heating and cooling equipment and other energy efficiency upgrades. Depending on the specific incentive or approval, NJNG recovers costs associated with the programs over a two to 10-year period through a tariff rider mechanism.\nSince inception, $149.7 million in grants, rebates and loans has been provided to customers, with a total annual recovery of approximately $20 million. In June 2016, the BPU approved NJNG's extension of SAVEGREEN through December 31, 2018. In October 2016, the BPU approved NJNG's filing to maintain the existing SAVEGREEN recovery rate. On October 20, 2017, the BPU approved NJNG's filing to decrease its EE recovery rate, which would result in an annual decrease of $3.9 million, effective November 1, 2017. The recovery includes a weighted average cost of capital that ranges from 6.69 percent to 7.76 percent, with a return on equity of 9.75 percent to 10.3 percent.\nConservation Incentive Program\nThe CIP facilitates normalizing NJNG's utility gross margin for variances not only due to weather but also for other factors affecting customer usage, such as conservation and energy efficiency. Recovery of utility gross margin for the non-weather variance through the CIP is limited to the amount of certain gas supply cost savings achieved and is subject to an annual earnings test. An annual review of the CIP must be filed by June 1, coincident with NJNG's annual BGSS filing, during which NJNG can request rate changes to the CIP. In May 2014, the BPU approved the continuation of the CIP program with no expiration date. Refer to Note 4. Regulation - BGSS and CIP in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, for a discussion of CIP rate actions.\nNJNG's total utility firm gross margin includes the following adjustments related to the CIP mechanism:\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weather (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,268\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Usage\n</td> <td>(2,309\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>10,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,136\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Compared with the CIP 20-year average, weather was 10 percent and 17.5 percent warmer-than-normal during fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 8.3 percent colder-than-normal during 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of September 30, 2017 and 2016, NJNG has $17.7 million and $37 million, respectively, in regulatory assets related to CIP to be collected from customers in future periods on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCommodity prices\nOur Natural Gas Distribution segment is affected by the price of natural gas, which can have a significant impact on our cash flows, short-term financing costs, the price of natural gas charged to our customers through the BGSS clause, our ability to collect accounts receivable, which impacts our bad debt expense, and our ability to maintain a competitive advantage over other fuel sources.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nNatural gas commodity prices may experience high volatility as shown in the graph below, which illustrates the daily natural gas prices(1) in the Northeast market region, also known as Tetco M-3.\n(1) Data source from Platts, a division of McGraw Hill Financial.\nThe maximum daily price was $8.71, $4.74 and $21.09 and the minimum daily price was $0.36, $0.67 and $0.77 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A more detailed discussion of the impacts of the price of natural gas on operating revenues, gas purchases and cash flows can be found in the Results of Operations and Cash Flow sections of Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nBGSS\nRecovery of natural gas costs\nNJNG's cost of natural gas is passed through to our customers, without markup, by applying NJNG's authorized BGSS rate to actual therms delivered. There is no utility gross margin associated with BGSS costs; therefore, changes in such costs do not impact NJNG's earnings. NJNG monitors its actual gas costs in comparison to its BGSS rates to manage its cash flows associated with its allowed recovery of natural gas costs, which is facilitated through BPU-approved deferred accounting and the BGSS pricing mechanism. Accordingly, NJNG occasionally adjusts its periodic BGSS rates or can issue credits or refunds, as appropriate, for its residential and small commercial customers when the commodity cost varies from the existing BGSS rate. BGSS rates for its large commercial customers are adjusted monthly based on NYMEX prices.\nOn September 22, 2017, the BPU provisionally approved NJNG's petition to maintain its BGSS rate for residential and small commercial customers, and increase its balancing charge rate, which will result in a $3.7 million increase to the annual revenues credited to BGSS, effective October 2017. During fiscal 2017 and 2016, NJNG issued bill credits of $42 million and $61.6 million, respectively, as a result of a decline in the wholesale price of natural gas. Refer to Note 4. Regulation - BGSS and CIP in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, for a further discussion of NJNG's periodic BGSS rate adjustments and bill credits.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nBGSS Incentive Programs\nNJNG is eligible to receive financial incentives for reducing BGSS costs through a series of utility gross margin-sharing programs that include off-system sales, capacity release and storage incentive programs. These programs are designed to encourage better utilization and hedging of NJNG's natural gas supply, transportation and storage assets. Depending on the program, NJNG shares 80 or 85 percent of utility gross margin generated by these programs with firm customers. Should performance of the existing incentives or market conditions warrant, NJNG is permitted to propose a process to re-evaluate and discuss alternative incentive programs annually. Utility gross margin from incentive programs was $13.7 million, $15 million and $17.7 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A more detailed discussion of the impacts to utility gross margin can be found in the Natural Gas Distribution Segment Operating Results section that follows.\nHedging\nIn order to provide relative price stability to its natural gas supply portfolio, NJNG employs a hedging strategy with the goal of having at least 75 percent of the Company's projected winter periodic BGSS gas sales volumes hedged by each November 1 and at least 25 percent of the projected BGSS gas sales hedged for the following April through March period. This is accomplished with the use of various financial instruments including futures, swaps and options used in conjunction with commodity and/or weather-related hedging activity.\nDue to the capital-intensive nature of NJNG's operations and the seasonal nature of its working capital requirements, significant changes in interest rates can impact NJNG's results. In an April 2014 BPU Order, NJNG received regulatory approval to enter into interest rate risk management transactions related to long-term debt securities. On June 1, 2015, NJNG entered into a treasury lock transaction to fix a benchmark treasury rate of 3.26 percent associated with the forecasted-year, $125 million debt issuance expected in May 2018. This forecasted debt issuance coincides with the maturity of NJNG's existing $125 million, 5.6 percent notes on May 15, 2018. The fair value of NJNG's treasury lock agreement is recorded as a component of regulatory assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets since the Company believes that the market value upon settlement will be reflected in future rates. Upon settlement, any gain or loss will be amortized in earnings over the life of the future debt issuance.\nA more detailed discussion of NJNG's debt can be found in the Liquidity and Capital Resources and Cash Flow sections of Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nSocietal Benefits Charge\nUSF\nNJNG's qualifying customers are eligible for the USF program, which is administered by the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, to help make energy bills more affordable. In September 2016, the BPU approved NJNG's annual USF compliance filing proposing to increase the statewide USF rate, resulting in a $1.3 million annual increase in USF recoveries, effective October 2016. Refer to Note 4. Regulation - Societal Benefits Clause in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, for a further discussion of NJNG's USF rates.\nEnvironmental Remediation\nNJNG is responsible for the environmental remediation of five MGP sites, which contain contaminated residues from former gas manufacturing operations that ceased operating at these sites by the mid-1950s and, in some cases, had been discontinued many years earlier. Actual MGP remediation costs may vary from management's estimates due to the developing nature of remediation requirements, regulatory decisions by the NJDEP and related litigation. NJNG reviews these costs at the end of each fiscal year and adjusts its liability and corresponding regulatory asset as necessary to reflect its expected future remediation obligation. Accordingly, NJNG recognized a regulatory asset and an obligation of $149 million as of September 30, 2017, a decrease of $23 million, compared with the prior fiscal period. The reduction was due to the completion of remediation work at certain sites and a reduction to the remediation scope of work at another site.\nOther\nIn May 2016, NJNG included a proposal in its base rate case to recover certain capital costs and incremental operation and maintenance costs related to a March 2016 BPU Order regarding new cybersecurity requirements. This proposal was updated in July 2016, and the associated costs were approved for recovery through NJNG's new base rates, effective October 2016.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nInterest Rate Risk\nDue to the capital-intensive nature of NJNG's operations and the seasonal nature of its working capital requirements, significant changes in interest rates can impact NJNG's results. A more detailed discussion can be found in the Liquidity and Capital Resources and Cash Flow sections of Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOther regulatory filings and a more detailed discussion of the filings in this section can be found in Note 4. Regulation in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCommodity Service to Customers\nThe EDECA, which was enacted in 1999, provides the framework for New Jersey's retail energy markets, which are open to competition from other electric and natural gas suppliers. NJNG's residential and commercial markets are currently open to competition, and its rates are segregated between BGSS (i.e., natural gas commodity) and delivery (i.e., transportation) components. NJNG does not earn utility gross margin on the commodity portion of its natural gas sales. NJNG earns utility gross margin through the delivery of natural gas to its customers and, therefore, is not negatively affected by customers who use its transportation service and purchase natural gas from another supplier. Under an existing order from the BPU, BGSS can be provided by suppliers other than the state's natural gas utilities, however, customers who purchase natural gas from another supplier continue to use NJNG for transportation service.\nOperating Results\nNJNG's operating results for the fiscal years ended September 30, are as follows:\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>695,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>594,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>781,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gas purchases (1) (2)\n</td> <td>269,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>215,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>355,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operation and maintenance\n</td> <td>142,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory rider expense (3)\n</td> <td>40,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>49,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy and other taxes (4)\n</td> <td>42,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>543,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>468,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>651,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>151,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>4,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net of capitalized interest\n</td> <td>25,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision\n</td> <td>43,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes the purchased cost of the natural gas, fees paid to pipelines and storage facilities, adjustments as a result of BGSS incentive programs and hedging transactions.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nManagement uses utility gross margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, when evaluating the operating results of NJNG. NJNG's utility gross margin is defined as natural gas revenues less natural gas purchases, sales tax, and regulatory rider expenses, and may not be comparable to the definition of gross margin used by others in the natural gas distribution business and other industries. Management believes that utility gross margin provides a meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations since natural gas costs, sales tax and regulatory rider expenses are included in operating revenue and passed through to customers and, therefore, have no effect on utility gross margin. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP measure.\nUtility Gross Margin\nA reconciliation of operating revenues, the closest GAAP financial measure to NJNG's utility gross margin, is as follows for the fiscal years ended September 30:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>695,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>594,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>781,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gas purchases\n</td> <td>269,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>215,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>355,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy taxes\n</td> <td>37,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory rider expense\n</td> <td>40,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utility gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>347,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>307,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUtility gross margin consists of three components:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>utility firm gross margin generated from only the delivery component of either a sales tariff or a transportation tariff from residential and commercial customers who receive natural gas service from NJNG;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>BGSS incentive programs, where revenues generated or savings achieved from BPU-approved off-system sales, capacity release or storage incentive programs are shared between customers and NJNG;

BGSS incentives were lower due primarily to decreases in the storage incentive program due primarily to higher cost at injection point, as well as decreases in capacity release and off system sales due primarily to the lower capacity value. The decrease in off-system sales was also driven by a decrease in the average price of gas sold, partially offset by an increase in volumes.

In addition, Clean Energy Ventures has entered into various long-term agreements, including PPAs, to supply energy from wind and solar projects.\nSolar\nSince its inception, Clean Energy Ventures has constructed a total of 189.1 MW of solar capacity and has an additional 11.2 MW under construction.\nSolar expenditures for the fiscal years ended September 30, are as follows:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in Thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Placed in service\n</td> <td>Projects\n</td> <td>MW\n</td> <td>Costs\n</td> <td>Projects\n</td> <td>MW\n</td> <td>Costs\n</td> <td>Projects\n</td> <td>MW\n</td> <td>Costs\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grid-connected (1)\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net-metered:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial (1)\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential\n</td> <td>1,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total placed in service\n</td> <td>1,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes projects subject to sale-leaseback arrangements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring fiscal 2017, Clean Energy Ventures entered into sale-leaseback arrangements for two of its commercial solar projects, for which the ITCs and other tax benefits associated with these solar projects were transferred to the buyer. During fiscal 2017, excluding those cost related to the commercial solar projects of $31.1 million that were included in the sale-leaseback transactions, $89.2 million of solar-related capital expenditures were ITC eligible. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, all solar-related capital expenditures were ITC eligible. We estimate total solar-related capital expenditures for ITC eligible projects during fiscal 2018 to be between $132 million and $140 million.\nAs part of its solar investment portfolio, Clean Energy Ventures operates a residential solar program, The Sunlight Advantage\u00ae, that provides qualifying homeowners the opportunity to have a solar system installed at their home with no installation or maintenance expenses. Clean Energy Ventures owns, operates and maintains the system over the life of the contract in exchange for monthly lease payments.\nOnce a solar installation has received the proper certifications and commences operations, each MWh of electricity produced creates an SREC that represents the renewable energy attribute of the solar-electricity generated that can be sold to third parties, predominantly load-serving entities that are required to comply with the solar requirements under New Jersey's renewable portfolio standard. In addition, under the recently updated federal tax guidelines, projects that are placed in service through December 31, 2019, qualify for a 30 percent federal ITC. The credit will decline to 26 percent for property under construction during 2020 and to 22 percent for property under construction during 2021. The ITC will be reduced to 10 percent for any property that is under construction before 2022, but not placed in service before 2024.\nOnshore Wind\nClean Energy Ventures invests in small to mid-size onshore wind projects that fit its investment profile and has a total of 126.6 MW of wind capacity as of September 30, 2017. The wind projects are eligible for PTCs for a 10-year period following commencement of operations and have PPAs of various terms in place, which typically govern the sale of energy, capacity and/or renewable energy credits. An $89 million, 39.9 MW wind project in Somerset County, Pennsylvania was completed in December 2016.\nClean Energy Ventures' investments are subject to a variety of factors, such as timing of construction schedules, permitting and regulatory processes, volatility of energy prices, the ability to secure PPAs, delays related to electric grid interconnection, which can affect our ability to commence operations on a timely basis or at all, economic trends, the ability to access capital or allocation of capital to other investments or business opportunities and other unforeseen events. Solar projects not placed in service, as originally planned prior to the end of a reporting period, may result in a failure to qualify for ITCs. Further, changes in prices\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\non the unhedged portion of SREC production could have a significant adverse impact on earnings with some offset expected from higher wind energy market prices due to the PTC phase out and/or improved efficiencies from lower costs for related turbine technology.\nWind projects for which construction of a facility begins after December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2019, will be subject to reduced PTCs and could have a significant adverse impact on 10 years of forward earnings. PTCs will be phased out from 100 percent in 2016 to 80 percent in 2017, 60 percent in 2018, 40 percent in 2019 and zero thereafter. In addition, since the primary contributors toward the value of qualifying clean energy projects are tax incentives and SRECs, changes in the federal statutes related to the ITC or PTC or in the marketplace and/or relevant legislation surrounding renewable clean energy credits, could significantly affect earnings.\nOperating Results\nClean Energy Ventures' financial results for the fiscal years ended September 30, are summarized as follows:\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operation and maintenance\n</td> <td>23,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>31,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other taxes\n</td> <td>1,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>726\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>56,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>7,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(758\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>2,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>16,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit)\n</td> <td>(31,161\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(26,592\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(26,968\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Revenues\nOperating revenues increased $10.9 million and $21 million during fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, compared with the previous fiscal years, and is comprised of the following:\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7.

All related costs are included as a component of O&M expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, including such expenses as facility maintenance and various fees.\nOperation and Maintenance Expense\nO&M expense increased $4.6 million in fiscal 2017 and $3.6 million in fiscal 2016, due primarily to additional maintenance, leasing and administrative costs associated with wind and solar projects placed in service, as well as increased shared corporate costs.\nDepreciation Expense\nDepreciation expense increased $7.9 million in fiscal 2017 and $6.7 million in fiscal 2016, as a result of increases in wind and solar projects placed in service.\nIncome Tax (Benefit)\nIncome tax benefit during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, includes $24.6 million, $25.7 million and $27.8 million respectively, of ITCs associated with solar projects, that were completed and placed into service during the corresponding fiscal year. Income tax benefit during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 includes $9.9 million and $6.7 million, and $2 million respectively, of PTCs associated with wind projects. Clean Energy Ventures recognized $29.2 million, $27 million, and $24.1 million related to tax credits, net of deferred taxes, during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nNet Income\nNet income in fiscal 2017 decreased $3.5 million, compared with fiscal 2016, due primarily to increased costs related to depreciation and O&M as previously discussed, as well as an increase in interest expense related to higher debt associated with capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase in operating revenues, as well as an increase in tax benefits recognized due primarily to an increase PTCs, as previously discussed.\nNet income during fiscal 2016 increased $8.3 million, compared with fiscal 2015, due primarily to the factors described above, partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to higher debt associated with capital expenditures.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nEnergy Services Segment\nOverview\nEnergy Services markets and sells natural gas to wholesale and retail customers and manages natural gas storage and transportation assets throughout major market areas across North America. Energy Services maintains a strategic portfolio of natural gas storage and transportation contracts that it utilizes in conjunction with its market expertise to provide service and value to its customers. Availability of these storage and transportation contracts allows Energy Services to generate market opportunities by capturing price differentials over specific time horizons and between geographic market locations.\nEnergy Services also provides management of storage and transportation assets for natural gas producers and regulated utilities. These management transactions typically involve the release of producer/utility owned storage and/or transportation capacity in combination with either an obligation to purchase and/or deliver physical natural gas. In addition to the contractual purchase and/or sale of physical natural gas, Energy Services generates or pays fee-based margin in exchange for its active management and may provide the producer and/or utility with additional margin based on actual results.\nIn conjunction with the active management of these contracts, Energy Services generates financial margin by identifying market opportunities and simultaneously entering into natural gas purchase/sale, storage or transportation contracts and financial derivative contracts. In cases where storage is utilized to fulfill these contracts, these forecast sales and/or purchases are economically hedged through the use of financial derivative contracts. The financial derivative contracts consist primarily of exchange-traded futures, options and swap contracts, and are frequently used to lock in anticipated transactional cash flows and to help manage volatility in natural gas market prices. Generally, when its storage and transportation contracts are exposed to periods of increased market volatility, Energy Services is able to implement strategies that allow them to capture margin by improving the respective time or geographic spreads on a forward basis.\nOn July 27, 2017, we acquired certain retail and wholesale natural gas energy contract assets from Talen. The acquisition included sales agreements with large commercial and industrial retail customers in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, pipeline and storage capacity agreements on various pipelines and various wholesale transportation contracts.\nEnergy Services accounts for its physical commodity contracts and its financial derivative instruments at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of physical commodity contracts and financial derivative instruments are included in earnings as a component of operating revenue or gas purchases on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Volatility in reported net income at Energy Services can occur over periods of time due to changes in the fair value of derivatives, as well as timing differences related to certain transactions. Unrealized gains and losses can fluctuate as a result of changes in the price of natural gas, SRECs and foreign currency from the original transaction price. Volatility in earnings can also occur as a result of timing differences between the settlement of financial derivatives and the sale of the underlying physical commodity. For example, when a financial instrument settles and the physical natural gas is injected into inventory, the realized gains and losses associated with the financial instrument are recognized in earnings. However, the gains and losses associated with the physical natural gas are not recognized in earnings until the natural gas inventory is withdrawn from storage and sold, at which time Energy Services realizes the entire margin on the transaction.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7.

Gas purchases also include a decrease due to the changes in the economic hedging of natural gas inventory of $75.3 million, partially offset by an increase of $63.4 million in unrealized gains on derivative instruments.\nDuring fiscal 2016, operating revenues decreased $737.1 million and gas purchases decreased $641.8 million due primarily to a decrease of $59.7 million related to changes in the value of financial hedges, as well as a decrease of approximately 26.5 percent in average gas prices, as well as a 12.1 percent decrease in sales volumes. The price decreases were related to the warm winter weather, primarily across the eastern United States, during fiscal 2016, compared with fiscal 2015.\nFuture results at Energy Services are contingent upon natural gas market price volatility driven by variations in both the supply and demand balances caused by weather and other factors. As a result, variations in weather patterns in the key market areas served may affect earnings during the fiscal year. Changes in market fundamentals, such as an increase in supply and decrease in demand due to milder temperatures, and reduced volatility, can negatively impact Energy Services' earnings. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Natural Gas Distribution Segment for Tetco M-3 Daily Prices, which illustrates the daily natural gas prices in the Northeast market region.\nOperation and Maintenance Expense\nO&M expense remained relatively flat during fiscal 2017, compared with fiscal 2016. O&M expense decreased $5.4 million, or 21.2 percent, during fiscal 2016, compared with fiscal 2015, due primarily to decreases in incentive compensation, charitable donations and shared services costs.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nNet Income\nNet income decreased $13.8 million during fiscal 2017, compared with fiscal 2016, due primarily to the decrease in operating income, partially offset by the related decrease in income tax expense. Net income decreased $57.8 million during fiscal 2016, compared with fiscal 2015, due primarily to lower operating income, partially offset by the related decrease in income tax expense.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nManagement uses financial margin and NFE, non-GAAP financial measures, when evaluating the operating results of Energy Services. Financial margin and NFE are based on removing timing differences associated with certain derivative instruments, as discussed above. Management views these measures as representative of the overall expected economic result and uses these measures to compare Energy Services' results against established benchmarks and earnings targets as these measures eliminate the impact of volatility on GAAP earnings as a result of timing differences associated with the settlement of derivative instruments. To the extent that there are unanticipated impacts from changes in the market value related to the effectiveness of economic hedges, Energy Services' actual non-GAAP results can differ from the results anticipated at the outset of the transaction. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP measure.\nWhen Energy Services reconciles the most directly comparable GAAP measure to both financial margin and NFE, the current period unrealized gains and losses on derivatives are excluded as a reconciling item. Financial margin and NFE also exclude the effects of economic hedging of the value of our natural gas in storage and, therefore, only include realized gains and losses related to natural gas withdrawn from storage, effectively matching the full earnings effects of the derivatives with realized margins on the related physical gas flows.\nFinancial Margin\nThe following table is a computation of Energy Services' financial margin for the fiscal years ended September 30.\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,462,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,197,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,934,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Gas purchases\n</td> <td>1,441,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,153,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,795,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments and related transactions (1)\n</td> <td>(10,063\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>48,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39,408\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effects of economic hedging related to natural gas inventory (2)\n</td> <td>38,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36,816\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(8,225\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes unrealized (gains) losses related to an intercompany transaction between NJNG and Energy Services that have been eliminated in consolidation of approximately $(751,000), $(1.3) million and $465,000 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Effects of hedging natural gas inventory transactions where the economic impact is realized in a future period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA reconciliation of operating income, the closest GAAP financial measure to Energy Services' financial margin, is as follows for the fiscal years ended September 30:\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating (loss) income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(793\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operation and maintenance\n</td> <td>20,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other taxes\n</td> <td>1,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal\n</td> <td>21,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments and related transactions\n</td> <td>(10,063\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>48,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39,408\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effects of economic hedging related to natural gas inventory\n</td> <td>38,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36,816\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(8,225\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7.

NFE decreased $20.2 million during fiscal 2016, compared with fiscal 2015, due primarily to a decrease in financial margin, partially offset by lower O&M.\nFuture results are subject to Energy Services' ability to expand its wholesale sales and service activities and are contingent upon many other factors, including an adequate number of appropriate and credit qualified counterparties in an active and liquid natural marketplace, volatility in the natural gas market due to weather or other fundamental market factors impacting supply and/or demand, transportation, storage and/or other market arbitrage opportunities, sufficient liquidity in the overall energy trading market and continued access to liquidity in the capital markets.\nMidstream Segment\nOverview\nOur Midstream segment invests in natural gas assets, such as natural gas transportation and storage facilities. We believe that acquiring, owning and developing these midstream assets, which operate under a tariff structure that has either regulated or market-based rates, can provide us a growth opportunity. To that end, we have a 50 percent ownership interest in Steckman Ridge, a storage facility that operates under market-based rates and a 20 percent ownership interest in PennEast, a natural gas pipeline, which we estimate to be completed and operational in 2019. PennEast may revise the project timeline further upon receipt of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity from FERC. As of September 30, 2017, our net investments in Steckman Ridge and PennEast were $120.3 million and $52.3 million, respectively.\nIn September 2015, Midstream exchanged its 5.53 percent ownership interest in Iroquois with Dominion Midstream Partners, L.P. for 1.84 million DM Common Units. As of September 30, 2017, the market value of the DM Common Units was $58.8 million. See Note 2.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nHome Services and Other Operations\nOverview\nThe financial results of Home Services and Other consist primarily of the operating results of NJRHS and CR&R. NJRHS provides service, sales and installation of appliances to approximately 112,000 service contract customers and has been focused on growing its installation business and expanding its service contract customer base. Home Services and Other also includes organizational expenses incurred at NJR. NJR Energy, a subsidiary of CR&R, which invested in other energy-related ventures, was dissolved on November 28, 2016, and all assets were moved to CR&R during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOperating Results\nThe consolidated financial results of Home Services and Other for the fiscal years ended September 30, are summarized as follows:\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operation and maintenance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy and other taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>685\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating revenue increased $1.1 million during fiscal 2017, compared with fiscal 2016, due primarily to increased furnace/air conditioner combination installations at NJRHS related to increased marketing promotions, along with increased contract revenue, partially offset by decreased operating revenue at CR&R due to the sale of a 56,400 square foot office building.\nOperating revenue decreased $206,000 during fiscal 2016, compared with fiscal 2015, due primarily to a decrease in heating equipment installations and generator sales at NJRHS resulting from warmer weather, partially offset by increased solar installations and increased contract revenue as a result of existing customers upgrading to enhanced plans and expanded service contract product lines.\nOther income, net increased $5.6 million during fiscal 2017, compared with fiscal 2016, due primarily to the sale of available for sale securities, which resulted in a pre-tax gain during fiscal 2017 of $5.4 million. Other income, net remained relatively flat during fiscal 2016, compared with fiscal 2015.\nIncome taxes increased $2.5 million during fiscal 2017, compared with fiscal 2016, due primarily to the increase in other income, as previously discussed. Income taxes decreased $164,000 during fiscal 2016, compared with fiscal 2015, due primarily to the decrease in operating revenues and the increase in O&M at NJRHS.\nNet income increased $3.9 million during fiscal 2017, compared with fiscal 2016, due primarily to the increases in other income and operating revenue, partially offset by the increase in the income tax provision, as discussed above.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur objective is to maintain an efficient consolidated capital structure that reflects the different characteristics of each reporting segment and business operations and provides adequate financial flexibility for accessing capital markets as required.\nOur consolidated capital structure as of September 30, was as follows:\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common stock equity\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommon Stock Equity\nWe satisfy our external common equity requirements, if any, through issuances of our common stock, including the proceeds from stock issuances under our DRP. The DRP allows us, at our option, to use treasury shares or newly issued shares to raise capital. In December 2015, we registered an additional 5 million shares of our common stock for issuance under the DRP. We raised $17.5 million and $16 million of equity through the DRP by issuing approximately 472,000 and 471,000 shares of treasury stock during fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIn 1996, the Board of Directors authorized us to implement a share repurchase program, which was expanded seven times since the inception of the program, authorizing a total of 19.5 million shares of common stock for repurchase. As of September 30, 2017, we have repurchased a total of approximately 17.1 million shares and may repurchase an additional 2.4 million shares under the approved program. There were 105,000 and 126,600 shares of common stock shares repurchased during fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDebt\nNJR and its unregulated subsidiaries generally rely on cash flows generated from operating activities and the utilization of committed credit facilities to provide liquidity to meet working capital and short-term debt financing requirements. NJNG also relies on the issuance of commercial paper for short-term funding. NJR and NJNG periodically access the capital markets to fund long-lived assets through the issuance of long-term debt securities.\nAs of September 30, 2017, we had a working capital deficit of $223.5 million, net income of $132.1 million and cash flows from operations of $248 million. The working capital deficit was primarily caused by the reclassification of approximately $150 million of long-term debt to current maturities. We believe that our existing borrowing availability, equity proceeds and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditures and dividend requirements for the next 12 months. NJR, NJNG, Clean Energy Ventures and Energy Services currently anticipate that each of their financing requirements for the next 12 months will be met primarily through the issuance of short and long-term debt, meter and solar sale-leasebacks and proceeds from our DRP, including utilizing the waiver discount feature.\nWe believe that as of September 30, 2017, NJR and NJNG were, and currently are, in compliance with all existing debt covenants, both financial and non-financial.\nShort-Term Debt\nWe use our short-term borrowings primarily to finance Energy Services' short-term liquidity needs, Midstream segment's PennEast contributions, share repurchases and, on an initial basis, Clean Energy Ventures' investments. Energy Services' use of high volume storage facilities and anticipated pipeline park-and-loan arrangements, combined with related economic hedging activities in the volatile wholesale natural gas market, create significant short-term cash requirements.\nNJNG satisfies its debt needs by issuing short- and long-term debt based on its financial profile. The seasonal nature of NJNG's operations creates large short-term cash requirements, primarily to finance natural gas purchases and customer accounts receivable. NJNG obtains working capital for these requirements and for the temporary financing of construction and MGP remediation expenditures and energy tax payments, based on its financial profile, through the issuance of commercial paper supported by the NJNG Credit Facility or through short-term bank loans under the NJNG Credit Facility.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7.

The NJR Credit Facility is scheduled to terminate on September 28, 2020, subject to two mutual options for a one-year extension beyond that date. Certain of NJR's unregulated subsidiaries have guaranteed to the lenders all of NJR's obligations under the NJR Credit Facility.\nThe NJR Credit Facility permits the borrowing of revolving loans and swingline loans, as well as the issuance of letters of credit. The NJR Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature, which would allow NJR, in the absence of a default or event of default, to increase from time to time, with the existing or new lenders, the revolving credit commitments under the NJR Credit Facility in minimum $5 million increments up to a maximum of $100 million. In addition, borrowings under the NJR Credit Facility are conditioned upon compliance with a maximum leverage ratio (consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization as defined in the NJR Credit Facility) of not more than .65 to 1.00 at any time. As of September 30, 2017, the consolidated total indebtedness to total capitalization ratio, as defined in the NJR Credit Facility, was 54 percent.\nAs of September 30, 2017, NJR had $255 million outstanding under the NJR Credit Facility. Neither NJNG nor its assets are obligated or pledged to support the NJR Credit Facility.\nDuring fiscal 2017, NJR's average interest rate under the NJR Credit Facility was 1.8 percent, resulting in interest expense of $4.4 million. Based on average borrowings under the facilities of $239.6 million during the period, a 100 basis point change in the underlying average interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately $2.5 million during fiscal 2017.\nAs of September 30, 2017, NJR has six letters of credit outstanding totaling $13.4 million. Three letters of credit totaling $10.4 million are on behalf of Energy Services and three letters of credit totaling $3 million are on behalf of Clean Energy Ventures. These letters of credit reduce the amount available under NJR's committed credit facility by the same amount. NJR does not anticipate that these letters of credit will be drawn upon by the counterparties and they will be renewed as necessary.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nEnergy Services' letters of credit are used for margin requirements for natural gas transactions and expire on dates ranging from December 2017 to September 2018. Clean Energy Ventures' letters of credit are used to secure construction of ground-mounted solar projects and to secure obligations pursuant to an Interconnection Services Agreement. They expire on dates ranging from May 2018 to August 2018.\nNJNG\nNJNG's commercial paper is sold through several commercial banks under an issuing and paying agency agreement and is supported by the $250 million NJNG Credit Facility. The NJNG Credit Facility permits the borrowing of revolving loans and swing loans, as well as the issuance of letters of credit. It also permits an increase to the facility, from time to time, with the existing or new lenders, in a minimum of $15 million increments up to a maximum of $50 million at the lending banks' discretion. Borrowings under NJNG's credit facility are conditioned upon compliance with a maximum leverage ratio (consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization as defined in the NJNG Credit Facility) of not more than .65 to 1.00 at any time. As of September 30, 2017, NJNG's consolidated total indebtedness to total capitalization ratio was 45 percent. As of September 30, 2017, the unused amount available under the NJNG Credit Facility, including amounts allocated to the backstop under the commercial paper program and the issuance of letters of credit, was $238 million. During fiscal 2017, NJNG's weighted average interest rate on outstanding commercial paper was .09 percent, resulting in interest expense of $2,500. Based on average borrowings under the facility of $222,169 during the period, a 100 basis point change in the underlying average interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately $2,200 during fiscal 2017.\nAs of September 30, 2017, NJNG has two letters of credit outstanding for $731,000. These letters of credit reduce the amount available under NJNG's committed credit facility by the same amount. NJNG does not anticipate that these letters of credit will be drawn upon by the counterparties. These letters of credit are used as collateral for soil remediation systems and expire on August 2018.\nShort-Term Debt Covenants\nBorrowings under the NJR Credit Facility and NJNG Credit Facility are conditioned upon compliance with a maximum leverage ratio (consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization as defined in the applicable agreements), of not more than .65 to 1.00 at any time. These revolving credit facilities contain customary representations and warranties for transactions of this type. They also contain customary events of default and certain covenants that will limit NJR's or NJNG's ability, beyond agreed upon thresholds, to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional debt;\n\u2022incur liens and encumbrances;\n\u2022make dispositions of assets;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022merge, consolidate, transfer, sell or lease all or substantially all of the borrowers' or guarantors' assets.\nThese covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications set forth in the applicable agreements.\nDefault Provisions\nThe agreements governing our long-term and short-term debt obligations include provisions that, if not complied with, could require early payment or similar actions. Default events include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022defaults for non-payment;\n\u2022defaults for breach of representations and warranties;\n\u2022defaults for insolvency;\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\n\u2022defaults for non-performance of covenants;\n\u2022cross-defaults to other debt obligations of the borrower; and\n\u2022guarantor defaults.\nThe occurrence of an event of default under these agreements could result in all loans and other obligations of the borrower becoming immediately due and payable and the termination of the credit facilities or term loan.\nLong-Term Debt\nNJR\nThe MetLife Facility, an unsecured, uncommitted $100 million private placement shelf note agreement with MetLife, allowed NJR to issue senior notes to MetLife or certain of MetLife's affiliates during a three-year issuance period that ended September 26, 2016, and was not renewed. There were no notes outstanding under the expired facility.\nNJR has outstanding $25 million of 2.51 percent senior notes due September 15, 2018, which were issued under a now-expired facility with MetLife and as of September 30, 2017, were classified as a current maturity of long-term debt.\nNJR has $50 million of 3.25 percent senior notes due September 2022, issued under a private placement debt shelf facility.\nOn November 7, 2014, NJR issued $100 million in 3.48 percent senior notes due November 7, 2024, under the Prudential Facility, which fully utilized the remaining capacity under the facility. The notes issued under the Prudential Facility are guaranteed by certain unregulated subsidiaries of NJR.\nOn March 22, 2016, NJR entered into a Note Purchase Agreement under which we issued, on August 18, 2016, $50 million of the Company's 3.2 percent senior notes due August 18, 2023, and $100 million of the Company's 3.54 percent senior notes due August 18, 2026. The notes are guaranteed by certain unregulated subsidiaries of the Company. The notes are unsecured. The proceeds of the notes were used for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures.\nOn August 18, 2017, NJR entered into a $100 million credit agreement due August 16, 2019. The term loan will accrue interest at a variable rate determined monthly, which is LIBOR plus 70 basis points. The weighted average interest rate on the on the term loan as of September 30, 2017, was 1.95 percent. Proceeds from the term loan will be used for general corporate purposes and working capital.\nNeither NJNG nor its assets are obligated or pledged to support NJR's long-term debt.\nNJNG\nNJNG and the Trustee are parties to the Mortgage Indenture, which secures all of NJNG's outstanding FMB. The Mortgage Indenture provides a direct first mortgage lien upon substantially all of the operating properties and franchises of NJNG (other than excepted property, such as cash on hand, choses-in-action, securities, rent, natural gas meters and certain materials, supplies, appliances and vehicles), subject only to certain permitted encumbrances. The Mortgage Indenture contains provisions subjecting after-acquired property (other than excepted property and subject to pre-existing liens, if any, at the time of acquisition) to the lien thereof.\nAs of September 30, 2017, NJNG's long-term debt consisted of $575 million in fixed-rate debt issuances secured by the Mortgage Indenture, with maturities ranging from 2018 to 2046, $97 million in secured variable rate debt with maturities ranging from 2027 to 2041 and $28.9 million in capital leases with various maturities ranging from 2017 to 2025.\nOn May 31, 2017, the BPU approved a petition filed by NJNG requesting authorization over a three-year period to issue up to $400 million of medium-term notes with a maturity of not more than 40 years, for up to five years with an option for two additional one-year extensions; enter into interest rate risk management transactions related to debt securities and redeem and refinance or defease any of NJNG's outstanding long-term debt securities.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nOn April 15, 2015, NJNG issued $50 million of 2.82 percent senior notes due April 15, 2025, and $100 million of 3.66 percent senior notes due April 15, 2045, in the private placement market pursuant to a note purchase agreement entered into on February 12, 2015. The notes are secured by an equal principal amount of NJNG's FMB (Series SS and TT, respectively) issued under NJNG's Mortgage Indenture. The proceeds of the notes were used for general corporate purposes, to refinance or retire debt and to fund capital expenditure requirements. The notes are subject to required prepayments upon the occurrence of certain events. NJNG may at any time prepay all or a portion of the notes at a make-whole prepayment price.\nOn June 1, 2015, NJNG entered into a treasury lock transaction to fix a benchmark treasury rate of 3.26 percent associated with a forecasted $125 million debt issuance expected in May 2018. This forecasted debt issuance coincides with the maturity of NJNG's existing $125 million, 5.6 percent notes due May 15, 2018, which as of September 30, 2017, were classified as a current maturity of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn June 21, 2016, NJNG entered into a Note Purchase Agreement, under which NJNG issued $125 million of its 3.63 percent senior notes due June 21, 2046. The notes are secured by an equal principal amount of NJNG's FMB (series UU) issued under NJNG's Mortgage Indenture. The proceeds of the notes will be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing or retiring short-term debt and funding capital expenditures. The notes are subject to required prepayments upon the occurrence of certain events. NJNG may prepay all or any part of the notes in amounts not less than $1 million in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding at 100 percent of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued interest and a make-whole amount, if applicable.\nOn January 17, 2017, the Company completed the purchase of three FMBs in lieu of redemption with an aggregate principal amount totaling $35.8 million. The FMBs bore interest at rates ranging from 4.5 percent to 4.9 percent. The bonds purchased in lieu of redemption are being held by the Company to provide an opportunity to evaluate remarketing alternatives.\nIn August 2011, NJNG completed a refunding of its outstanding Auction-Rate Securities whereby the EDA issued a total of $97 million of Natural Gas Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds (New Jersey Natural Gas Company Project) composed of three series of bonds. EDA Bonds are special, limited obligations of the EDA payable solely from payments made by NJNG pursuant to a Loan Agreement and are secured by the pledge of $97 million principal amount of the FMB issued by the Company.\nEDA Bonds accrue interest at a variable rate determined monthly, which was initially calculated as a rate of .55 percent, plus 70 percent of one month LIBOR, subject to earlier redemption or conversion to another interest rate mode. The maximum interest rate on the EDA Bonds is 12 percent per annum. NJNG's obligations under the Loan Agreement, and its corresponding obligations under the FMB, match the respective principal amounts, interest rates and maturity dates of the EDA Bonds. The weighted average interest rate on the EDA Bonds as of September 30, 2017, was 1.42 percent.\nThe interest rates on variable rate debt may vary based upon market conditions. Sudden increases in the interest rate could cause a change in interest expense and cash flow for the Company in the future.\nNJR is not obligated directly or contingently with respect to the NJNG notes or the FMB.\nLong-Term Debt Covenants and Default Provisions\nThe NJR and NJNG long-term debt instruments contain customary representations and warranties for transactions of their type. They also contain customary events of default and certain covenants that will limit NJR or NJNG's ability beyond agreed upon thresholds to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional debt (including a covenant that limits the amount of consolidated total debt of the borrower at the end of a fiscal quarter to 65 percent of the consolidated total capitalization of the borrower, as those terms are defined in the applicable agreements, and a covenant limiting priority debt to 20 percent of the borrower's consolidated total capitalization, as those terms are defined in the applicable agreements);\n\u2022incur liens and encumbrances;\n\u2022make loans and investments;\n\u2022make dispositions of assets;\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\n\u2022make dividends or restricted payments;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022merge, consolidate, transfer, sell or lease substantially all of the borrower's assets.\nThe aforementioned covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications set forth in the applicable note purchase agreements.\nIn addition, the FMB issued by NJNG under the Mortgage Indenture are subject to certain default provisions. Events of Default, as defined in the Mortgage Indenture, consist mainly of:\n\u2022failure for 30 days to pay interest when due;\n\u2022failure to pay principal or premium when due and payable;\n\u2022failure to make sinking fund payments when due;\n\u2022failure to comply with any other covenants of the Mortgage Indenture after 30 days' written notice from the Trustee;\n\u2022failure to pay or provide for judgments in excess of $30 million in aggregate amount within 60 days of the entry thereof; or\n\u2022certain events that are or could be the basis of a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency or receivership proceeding.\nUpon the occurrence and continuance of such an Event of Default, the Mortgage Indenture, subject to any provisions of law applicable thereto, provides that the Trustee may take possession and conduct the business of NJNG, may sell the trust estate or proceed to foreclose the lien of the Mortgage Indenture. The interest rate on defaulted principal and interest, to the extent permitted by law, on the FMB issued under the Mortgage Indenture is the rate stated in the applicable supplement or, if no such rate is stated, six percent per annum.\nSale-Leaseback\nNJNG\nNJNG received $9.6 million, $7.1 million and $7.2 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in connection with the sale-leaseback of its natural gas meters. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, NJNG exercised early purchase options with respect to meter leases by making final principal payments of $2.4 million, $1.9 million and $768,000, respectively. NJNG continues to evaluate this sale-leaseback program based on current market conditions. As noted, natural gas meters are accepted as property under the Mortgage Indenture.\nClean Energy Ventures\nDuring September 2017, Clean Energy Ventures entered into transactions to sell two of its commercial solar assets concurrent with agreements to lease the assets back over seven year periods. These sale-leasebacks are financing obligations secured by the solar assets and related future cash flows from SREC and energy sales. ITCs and other tax benefits associated with these solar projects were transferred to the buyer. Clean Energy Ventures will continue to operate the solar projects and retain ownership of SRECs generated and has the option to renew the lease or repurchase the assets at the end of the lease term. Clean Energy Ventures received proceeds of $32.9 million in connection with these sale-leasebacks.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7.

We do not expect to be required to make additional contributions to fund the pension plans over the following two fiscal years based on current actuarial assumptions, however, funding requirements are uncertain and can depend significantly on changes in actuarial assumptions, returns on plan assets and changes in the demographics of eligible employees and covered dependents. In addition, as in the past, we may elect to make discretionary contributions to the plans in excess of the minimum required amount. We made no discretionary contributions to the pension plans in fiscal 2017. There are no Federal requirements to pre-fund OPEB benefits. However, we are required to fund certain amounts due to regulatory agreements with the BPU. We anticipate that the annual funding level to the OPEB plans will range from $4 million to $7 million annually over each of the next five years. Additional contributions may vary based on market conditions and various assumptions.\nAs of September 30, 2017, there were NJR guarantees covering approximately $331.4 million of natural gas purchases and Energy Services demand fee commitments not yet reflected in accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNJNG's incurs significant capital expenditures consisting primarily of its construction program to support customer growth, maintenance of its distribution and transmission system and replacement needed under pipeline safety regulations. During fiscal 2017, committed and spent capital expenditures totaled $177.6 million. In fiscal 2018 and 2019, NJNG's total capital expenditures are projected to be $399.8 million and $235 million, respectively.\nIn November 2012, NJNG filed a petition with the BPU requesting deferral accounting for incurred uninsured incremental O&M costs associated with Superstorm Sandy. As of September 30, 2017, NJNG deferred $13 million in regulatory assets that was approved for recovery through NJNG's new base rates, effective October 2016.\nNJNG expects to fund its obligations with a combination of cash flow from operations, cash on hand, issuance of commercial paper, available capacity under its revolving credit facility and the issuance of long-term debt.\nAs of September 30, 2017, NJNG's future MGP expenditures are estimated to be $149 million. For a more detailed description of MGP see Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nEstimated capital expenditures are reviewed on a regular basis and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, unforeseen events and the ability to access capital.\nClean Energy Ventures's expenditures include clean energy projects that support our goal to promote renewable energy. Accordingly, Clean Energy Ventures enters into agreements to install solar equipment involving both residential and commercial projects. During fiscal 2017, capital expenditures related to the purchase and installation of the solar equipment were $115.1 million. An additional $13.3 million has been committed or accrued for solar projects to be placed into service during fiscal 2018 and beyond. We estimate solar-related capital expenditures placed in service in fiscal 2018 to be between $132 million and $140 million.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Clean Energy Ventures completed construction of a $89 million, 39.9 MW onshore wind project in Somerset County, Pennsylvania.\nCapital expenditures related to clean energy projects are subject to change due to a variety of factors that may affect our ability to commence operations at these projects on a timely basis or at all, including logistics associated with the start-up of residential and commercial solar projects, such as timing of construction schedules, the permitting and regulatory process, any delays related to electric grid interconnection, economic trends, unforeseen events and the ability to access capital or allocation of capital to other investments or business opportunities.\nDuring fiscal 2017, Midstream had a total of $27.1 million of expenditures related to our investment in the PennEast pipeline project. Expenditures in the PennEast pipeline are expected to total between $220 million and $280 million.\nEnergy Services does not currently anticipate any significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 and 2019.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\nOur off-balance-sheet arrangements consist of guarantees covering approximately $331.4 million of natural gas purchases, SREC sales and demand fee commitments, see Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, and eight outstanding letters of credit totaling $14.1 million, as noted above, see Note 9. Debt.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2017, totaled $248 million compared with $142.6 million during fiscal 2016. Operating cash flows are primarily affected by variations in working capital, which can be impacted by several factors, including:\n\u2022seasonality of our business;\n\u2022fluctuations in wholesale natural gas prices and other energy prices, including changes in derivative asset and liability values;\n\u2022timing of storage injections and withdrawals;\n\u2022the deferral and recovery of gas costs;\n\u2022changes in contractual assets utilized to optimize margins related to natural gas transactions;\n\u2022broker margin requirements;\n\u2022impact of unusual weather patterns on our wholesale business;\n\u2022timing of the collections of receivables and payments of current liabilities;\n\u2022volumes of natural gas purchased and sold; and\n\u2022timing of SREC deliveries.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nThe increase of $105.4 million in operating cash flows during fiscal 2017, compared with fiscal 2016, was due primarily to increased base rates, increased working capital due primarily to lower broker margin requirements, a decrease in bill credits issued, and a discretionary contribution of $30 million to our pension plan during fiscal 2016 that did not recur in fiscal 2017.\nThe decrease of $248.3 million in operating cash flows during fiscal 2016, compared with fiscal 2015, was impacted by a decrease in market volatility related to the warm winter weather primarily across the eastern United States, which contributed to a lower profitability and decrease in working capital at Energy Services, including a reduction in natural gas sold out of storage and an increase in broker margin due to decreases in the fair value of derivatives and higher initial margin requirements. Also contributing to the decrease in operating cash flows were bill credits of $61.6 million issued to NJNG's customers during fiscal 2016, for overrecovered gas costs and a discretionary contribution of $30 million to our pension plan during fiscal 2016.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled $390.7 million during fiscal 2017, compared with $363.2 million during fiscal 2016. The increase of $27.5 million was due primarily to our acquisition of Talen's retail and wholesale energy contract assets totaling $55.7 million and increased investments in solar projects and PennEast of $39.4 million and $15.9 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures in wind investments of $39.1 million and utility plant of $32 million, along with net proceeds of $9.4 million from the sale of an office building and $6.6 million from the sale of available for sale securities.\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled $363.2 million during fiscal 2016, compared with $321.7 million during fiscal 2015. The increase of $41.5 million was due primarily to an increase in utility plant of $36.3 million and an increase in capital expenditures at Clean Energy Ventures of $14.5 million related to solar projects. We also contributed an additional $5.4 million for the investment in PennEast during fiscal 2016. The increases were partially offset by a decrease of $16.5 million in capital expenditures related to solar projects at Clean Energy Ventures.\nNJNG's capital expenditures result primarily from the need for services, mains and meters to support its continued customer growth, mandated pipeline safety rulemaking, general system improvements and approved infrastructure programs. NJNG's capital expenditures, including cost of removal, totaled $176.2 million and $205.1 million in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.\nThe Company enters into various agreements to install, own and operate solar equipment, including both residential and commercial projects and onshore wind projects. During fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, capital expenditures on these projects totaled $149.4 million and $149.1 million, respectively.\nHome Services and Other capital expenditures in past years were made primarily in connection with investments made to preserve the value of real estate holdings. On March 8, 2017, CR&R sold a 56,400 square foot office building on five acres of land located in Monmouth County for $9.4 million, net of closing costs, generating a pre-tax gain of $1.9 million.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing cash flows generally are seasonal in nature and are impacted by the volatility in pricing in the natural gas and other energy markets. NJNG's inventory levels are built up during its natural gas injection season (April through October) and reduced during withdrawal season (November through March) in response to the supply requirements of its customers. Changes in financing cash flows can also be impacted by gas management and marketing activities at Energy Services and clean energy investments at Clean Energy Ventures.\nCash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2017 totaled $107.3 million, compared with cash flows used in financing activities of $253.2 million during fiscal 2016. The decrease of $145.9 million is due primarily to the issuance of $100 million of long-term debt compared with $275 million in the previous year, the purchase of three FMBs in lieu of redemption totaling $35.8 million at NJNG and $50 million redemption of long-term debt at NJR, partially offset by an increase in short-term borrowings at NJR and proceeds of $32.9 million from the solar sale-leasebacks at Clean Energy Ventures.\nCash flows used in financing activities during fiscal 2016 totaled $253.2 million, compared with $66.4 million during fiscal 2015. The decrease of $319.6 million was due primarily to increased short-term borrowings at NJR. This was partially offset by the issuance of $100 million in long-term debt for NJR during fiscal 2015, along with a decrease of $25 million in long-term debt at NJNG, which issued $125 million during fiscal 2016, compared with $150 million during fiscal 2015. There was also a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock when compared with fiscal 2015, during which 688,000 new shares were issued through the waiver discount feature of the DRP.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nNJNG received $9.6 million, $7.1 million and $7.2 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in connection with the sale-leaseback of its natural gas meters. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, NJNG exercised early purchase options with respect to meter leases by making final principal payments of $2.4 million, $1.9 million and $768,000, respectively. NJNG continues to evaluate the natural gas meter sale-leaseback program based on current market conditions.\nCredit Ratings\nThe table below summarizes NJNG's current credit ratings issued by two rating entities, S&P and Moody's, as of September 30, 2017:\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate Rating\n</td> <td>A\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Paper\n</td> <td>A-1\n</td> <td>P-1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Secured\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> <td>Aa2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratings Outlook\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese ratings were reaffirmed by S&P on October 26, 2017, and by Moody's on October 4, 2017. NJNG's S&P and Moody's ratings are investment-grade ratings. NJR is not a rated entity.\nAlthough NJNG is not party to any lending agreements that would accelerate the maturity date of any obligation caused by a failure to maintain any specific credit rating, if such ratings are downgraded below investment grade, borrowing costs could increase, as would the costs of maintaining certain contractual relationships and future financing and our access to capital markets would be reduced. Even if ratings are downgraded without falling below investment grade, NJR and NJNG could face increased borrowing costs under their credit facilities. A rating set forth above is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold NJR's or NJNG's securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. Each rating set forth above should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nThe timing and mix of any external financings will target a common equity ratio that is consistent with maintaining NJNG's current short-term and long-term credit ratings.", "summary": "The report provides a detailed discussion of New Jersey Resources Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nAccounting guidance requires that we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the positions will not be sustained when challenged by taxing authorities. We have no reason to believe that we have any future obligations associated with unrecognized tax benefits, therefore, as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, we have not recorded any liabilities related to uncertain tax positions. Any significant changes to the estimates and judgments with respect to the interpretations, timing or deductibility could result in a material change to earnings and cash flows.\nTo the extent that NJNG invests in property that qualifies for ITCs, the ITC is deferred and amortized to income over the life of the equipment in accordance with regulatory treatment. For our unregulated subsidiaries, we recognize ITCs as a reduction to income tax expense when the property is placed in service.\nTo the extent that the Company invests in property that qualifies for PTCs, the PTC is recognized as a reduction to current federal income tax expense as the PTCs are generated through the production activities of the assets.\nChanges to the federal statutes related to ITCs and PTCs, which have the effect of reducing or eliminating the credits, could have a negative impact on earnings and cash flows.\nEnvironmental Costs\nAt the end of each fiscal year, NJNG, with the assistance of an independent consulting firm, updates the environmental review of its MGP sites, including its potential liability for investigation and remedial action. From this review, NJNG estimates expenditures necessary to remediate and monitor these MGP sites. As of September 30, 2017, NJNG estimated these expenditures will range from approximately $117.6 million to $205.2 million. NJNG's estimate of these liabilities is developed from then currently available facts, existing technology and current laws and regulations.\nIn accordance with accounting standards for contingencies, NJNG's policy is to record a liability when it is probable that the cost will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated. NJNG will determine a range of liabilities and will record the most likely amount. If no point within the range is more likely than any other, NJNG will accrue the lower end of the range. Since we believe that recovery of these expenditures, as well as related litigation costs, is possible through the regulatory process, we have recorded a regulatory asset corresponding to the related accrued liability. Accordingly, NJNG recorded an MGP remediation liability and a corresponding regulatory asset of $149 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which is based on the most likely amount. This was reduced from $172 million in fiscal 2016, due to the completion of remediation work at certain sites and a reduction to the remediation scope of work at another site.\nThe actual costs to be incurred by NJNG are dependent upon several factors, including final determination of remedial action, changing technologies and governmental regulations, the ultimate ability of other responsible parties to pay, as well as the potential impact of any litigation and any insurance recoveries. As of September 30, 2017 and 2016, $28.5 million and $19.6 million of previously incurred remediation costs, net of recoveries from customers and insurance proceeds received, are included in regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively.\nIf there are changes in the regulatory position surrounding these costs, or should actual expenditures vary significantly from estimates in that these costs are disallowed for recovery by the BPU, such costs would be charged to income in the period of such determination.\nPostemployment Employee Benefits\nOur costs of providing postemployment employee benefits are dependent upon numerous factors, including actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Postemployment employee benefit costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age, compensation levels and employment periods, the level of contributions made to the plans, changes in long-term interest rates and the return on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans or healthcare legislation may also impact current and future postemployment employee benefit costs. Postemployment employee benefit costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, changes in mortality tables, health care cost trends and discount rates used in determining the PBO. In determining the PBO and cost amounts, assumptions can change from period to period and could result in material changes to net postemployment employee benefit periodic costs and the related liability recognized by us.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nOur postemployment employee benefit plan assets consist primarily of U.S. equity securities, international equity securities and fixed-income investments, with a targeted allocation of 40 percent, 20 percent and 40 percent, respectively. Fluctuations in actual market returns, as well as changes in interest rates, may result in increased or decreased postemployment employee benefit costs in future periods. Postemployment employee benefit expenses are included in O&M expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following is a summary of a sensitivity analysis for each actuarial assumption:\n\n\nOn October 1, 2016, we changed our approach used to measure the service and interest cost components of its net periodic benefit costs. Previously, the Company estimated service cost and interest cost based on a single weighted-average discount rate from the yield curve used to measure its projected benefit obligation. Effective October 1, 2016, we determine our service and interest cost based upon duration specific spot rates that are aligned to each year's future benefit payments. Under the new approach, net periodic benefit costs will be lower during periods of low interest rates and upward-sloping yield curves. Conversely, in a downward sloping-yield curve environment, costs could increase. Refer to Note 11. Employee Benefit Plans in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our change in method.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe recognize AROs related to the costs associated with cutting and capping NJNG's main and service gas distribution mains, which is required by New Jersey law when taking such gas distribution mains out of service. We also recognize AROs associated with Clean Energy Ventures' solar and wind assets when there are decommissioning provisions in lease agreements that require removal of the asset at the end of the lease term.\nAROs are initially recognized when the legal obligation to retire an asset has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The discounted fair value is recognized as an ARO liability with a corresponding amount capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the underlying asset. The obligation is subsequently accreted to the future value of the expected retirement cost and the corresponding asset retirement cost is depreciated over the life of the related asset. Accretion expense associated with Clean Energy Ventures' ARO is recognized as a component of operations and maintenance expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior to October 1, 2016, accretion amounts associated with NJNG's ARO were not reflected as an expense, but rather were deferred as a regulatory asset and netted against NJNG's regulatory liabilities for presentation purposes. Through NJNG's new base rates settlement, effective October 1, 2016, accretion is recognized as part of its depreciation expense and the corresponding regulatory asset and liability will be shown gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nEstimating future removal costs requires management to make significant judgments because most of the removal obligations span long time frames and removal may be conditioned upon future events. Asset removal technologies are also constantly changing, which makes it difficult to estimate removal costs. Accordingly, inherent in the estimate of our AROs are various assumptions including the ultimate settlement date, expected cash outflows, inflation rates, credit-adjusted risk-free rates and consideration of potential outcomes where settlement of the ARO can be conditioned upon events. In the latter case, we develop possible retirement scenarios and assign probabilities based on management's reasonable judgment and knowledge of industry practice. Accordingly, AROs are subject to change.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recently issued accounting standards.\nManagement's Overview\nConsolidated\nNJR is an energy services holding company providing retail natural gas service in New Jersey and wholesale natural gas and related energy services to customers in the United States and Canada. In addition, we invest in clean energy projects, midstream assets and provide various repair, sales and installations services. A more detailed description of our organizational structure can be found in Item 1. Business.\nReporting Segments\nWe have four primary reporting segments as presented in the chart below:\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nIn addition to our four reporting segments, we have non-utility operations that either provide corporate support services or do not meet the criteria to be treated as a separate reporting segment. These operations, which comprise Home Services and Other, include: appliance repair services, sales and installations at NJRHS; and commercial real estate holdings at CR&R.\nA summary of our consolidated results in net income and assets by reporting segment and operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, is as follows:\n\n (1) Consists of transactions between subsidiaries that are eliminated in consolidation. \nNet Income\nThe primary drivers of the changes noted above, which are described in more detail in the individual segment discussions, are discussed below.\nThe increase in net income of $393,000 during fiscal 2017, compared with fiscal 2016, was primarily driven by increased gross margin at our Natural Gas Distribution segment due primarily to increased base rates which were effective October 1, 2016, increased other income at Home Services and Other due to the sale of available for sale securities and increased equity in earnings of affiliates at Midstream. These increases were partially offset by decreased operating income at Energy Services due primarily to a decrease of $16.4 million related to changes in the value of financial hedges and a decrease at Clean Energy Ventures due primarily to increased depreciation, operating and interest expenses, partially offset by increased revenues and increased PTCs.\nThe decrease in net income of $49.3 million during fiscal 2016, compared with fiscal 2015, was primarily driven by a decrease at Energy Services related to lower operating income due primarily to a decrease of $59.7 million related to changes in the value of financial hedges. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $8.3 million at Clean Energy Ventures due primarily to operating revenue related to higher SREC and electricity sales, partially offset by increased costs related to depreciation, O&M and interest expense.\nAssets\nThe increase in assets during fiscal 2017, compared with fiscal 2016, was due primarily to additional solar expenditures at Clean Energy Ventures, the acquisition of Talen's wholesale and retail energy contract assets at Energy Services, increased PennEast capital contributions and an increase in the market value of our DM Common Units at Midstream, along with additional utility plant expenditures at our Natural Gas Distribution segment. The increase in assets during fiscal 2016, compared with fiscal 2015, was due primarily to additional utility plant expenditures at Natural Gas Distribution and additional solar expenditures at Clean Energy Ventures, as well as increased broker margin and gas in storage at Energy Services.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur management uses NFE, a non-GAAP financial measure, when evaluating our operating results. Energy Services economically hedges its natural gas inventory with financial derivative instruments. NFE is a measure of the earnings based on eliminating timing differences surrounding the recognition of certain gains or losses, to effectively match the earnings effects of the economic hedges with the physical sale of gas and, therefore, eliminates the impact of volatility to GAAP earnings associated with the derivative instruments. To the extent we utilize forwards, futures, or other derivatives to hedge forecasted SREC production, unrealized gains and losses are also eliminated for NFE purposes.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or a replacement of, the comparable GAAP measure and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results. The following is a reconciliation of consolidated net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to NFE:\n\n (1) Effects of hedging natural gas inventory transactions where the economic impact is realized in a future period. \nNFE by reporting segment and other operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, discussed in more detail within the operating results sections of each segment, is summarized as follows:\n\n (1) Consists of transactions between subsidiaries that are eliminated in consolidation. \nThe increase in NFE during fiscal 2017, compared with fiscal 2016, was due primarily to increases at our Natural Gas Distribution segment, Midstream and Home Services and Other, as previously discussed, partially offset by lower financial margin at Energy Services due primarily to lower sales volumes and fewer market opportunities and the decrease at Clean Energy Ventures, as previously discussed.\nThe decrease in NFE during fiscal 2016, compared with fiscal 2015, was driven primarily by decreased financial margin at Energy Services due primarily to lower volatility and narrower price spreads resulting from the record warm winter weather primarily across the eastern United States, partially offset by lower taxes and O&M, partially offset by higher NFE at Clean Energy Ventures due primarily to increase in SREC and energy sales.\nNatural Gas Distribution Segment\nOverview\nOur Natural Gas Distribution segment is comprised of NJNG, a natural gas utility that provides regulated retail natural gas service in central and northern New Jersey to approximately 529,800 residential and commercial customers in its service territory and also participates in the off-system sales and capacity release markets. The business is subject to various risks, which can negatively impact customer growth, operating and financing costs, fluctuations in commodity prices and customer conservation efforts. These risks include, but are not limited to, adverse economic conditions, customer usage, certain regulatory actions, environmental remediation and severe weather conditions. It is often difficult to predict the impact of events or trends associated with these risks.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nIn addition, NJNG's business is seasonal by nature, as weather conditions directly influence the volume of natural gas delivered to customers on an annual basis. Specifically, customer demand substantially increases during the winter months when natural gas is used for heating purposes. As a result, NJNG receives most of its natural gas distribution revenues during the first and second fiscal quarters and is subject to variations in earnings and working capital during the year.\nAs a regulated company, NJNG is required to recognize the impact of regulatory decisions on its financial statements. See Note 4. Regulation in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion on regulatory actions, including filings related to programs and associated expenditures, as well as rate requests related to recovery of capital investments and operating costs.\nNJNG's operations are managed with the goal of providing safe and reliable service, growing its customer base, diversifying its gross margin, promoting clean energy programs and mitigating the risks discussed above through several key initiatives, including:\n \u2022 earning a reasonable rate of return on the investments in its natural gas distribution and transmission businesses, as well as timely recovery of all prudently incurred costs to provide safe and reliable service throughout NJNG's territory; \n \u2022 continuing to invest in the safety and integrity of its infrastructure; \n \u2022 managing its customer growth rate, which NJNG expects will be approximately 1.7 percent annually through fiscal 2019; \n \u2022 maintaining a collaborative relationship with the BPU on regulatory initiatives, including: \n- planning and authorization of infrastructure investments;\n- pursuing rate and regulatory strategies to stabilize and decouple margin, including CIP;\n- utilizing BGSS incentive programs through BPU-approved mechanisms to reduce gas costs and generate margin; and\n- administering and promoting NJNG's BPU-approved SAVEGREEN Project;\n \u2022 managing the volatility of wholesale natural gas prices through a hedging program designed to keep customers' BGSS rates as stable as possible; and \n \u2022 working with the NJDEP and BPU to manage its financial obligations related to remediation activities associated with its former MGP sites. \nBase Rate Case\nIn September 2016, the BPU approved NJNG's base rate case, effective October 2016, which included the following:\n \u2022 an increase in base rates in the amount of $45 million. The base rate increase includes a return on common equity of 9.75 percent, a common equity ratio of 52.5 percent and an increase in the overall depreciation rate from 2.34 percent to 2.4 percent; \n \u2022 the recovery of SAFE I capital investments and the rate mechanism and five-year extension of SAFE II. The estimated cost for SAFE II extension, excluding AFUDC, is approximately $200 million and related costs to be recovered on an accelerated basis are approximately $157.5 million. As a condition of the extension approval, NJNG is required to file a base rate case no later than November 2019; \n \u2022 rate recovery of NJ RISE capital investment costs through June 30, 2016, and the filing for recovery of future NJ RISE capital investment costs to be recovered, will occur in conjunction with SAFE II, commencing with the rate recovery filing submitted in March 2017; \n \u2022 recovery of NJNG's NGV and LNG plant investments; and \n \u2022 recovery of other costs previously deferred in regulatory assets over seven years. \nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nInfrastructure projects\nNJNG has significant annual capital expenditures associated with the management of its natural gas distribution and transmission system, including new utility plant associated with customer growth and its associated PIM and infrastructure programs.\nBelow is a summary of NJNG's capital expenditures, including accruals and estimates for expected investments over the next two fiscal years:\nEstimated capital expenditures are reviewed on a regular basis and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory oversight, environmental regulations, unforeseen events and the ability to access capital.\nSAFE and NJ RISE\nNJNG continues to implement BPU-approved infrastructure projects that are designed to enhance the reliability and integrity of NJNG's gas distribution system.\nThe BPU approved recovery of SAFE I capital investments through September 30, 2016, and approved the rate mechanism and extension of SAFE II for an additional five years to replace the remaining unprotected steel mains and services from its natural gas distribution system at an estimated cost of approximately $200 million, excluding AFUDC. The accelerated cost recovery methodology for the $157.5 million associated with the extension of SAFE II was approved in NJNG's new base rates. The remaining $42.5 million in capital expenditures will be requested for recovery in a future base rate case.\nThe BPU approved the recovery of NJNG's NJ RISE capital infrastructure program, which consists of six capital investment projects estimated to cost $102.5 million, excluding AFUDC, for gas distribution storm hardening and mitigation projects, along with associated depreciation expense. These system enhancements are intended to minimize service impacts during extreme weather events to customers that live in the most storm prone areas of NJNG's service territory. Recovery of NJ RISE investments through June 30, 2016, is included in NJNG's base rates.\nOn March 30, 2017, NJNG filed its annual petition with the BPU requesting a base rate increase for the recovery of NJ RISE and SAFE II capital investment costs, with a weighted cost of capital of 6.9 percent including a return on equity of 9.75 percent, related to the period ending June 30, 2017, based on estimates, pursuant to the September 2016 base rate case. On July 20,\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\n2017, NJNG filed an update to this petition with actuals, requesting a $4.1 million annual increase in recoveries, which was approved by the BPU, effective October 1, 2017.\nNGV Advantage\nIn June 2012, the BPU approved a pilot program for NJNG to invest up to $10 million to build NGV refueling stations. The NGV program was authorized by the BPU to earn an overall weighted average cost of capital of 7.1 percent, including a return on equity of 10.3 percent. A portion of the proceeds from the utilization of the compressed natural gas equipment, along with any available federal and state incentives, will be credited back to customers to offset a portion of the cost of the NGV investment. All three of the NGV stations are open to the public and NJNG is recovering its costs through base rates effective October 2016.\nLiquefaction/LNG\nIn June 2016, NJNG's Liquefaction facility became operational and allows NJNG to convert natural gas into LNG to fill its existing LNG storage tanks. Costs for this project along with other plant upgrades were approximately $36.5 million and are being recovered through NJNG's new base rates effective October 2016.\nSouthern Reliability Link\nThe SRL is an approximate 30-mile, 30-inch transmission main designed to support improved system reliability and integrity in the southern portion of NJNG's service territory, estimated to cost between $180 million and $200 million. In January 2016, the BPU issued an order approving NJNG's modified, proposed SRL pipeline installation, operation and route selection. In March 2016, the BPU issued an order designating the SRL route and exempting the SRL from municipal land use ordinances, regulations, permits and license requirements. In February 2017, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection issued a permit authorizing construction of the SRL within the jurisdiction of the Coastal Area Facility Review Act, as well as a Freshwater Wetlands permit. On September 14, 2017, the NJ Pinelands Commission approved construction of the SRL as being compliant with the Commission's Comprehensive Management Plan. All approvals and permits have been appealed by third parties. Once the final road opening permits and easements are secured, construction is expected to begin, with an estimated in-service date during the first quarter of fiscal 2019.\nCustomer growth\nIn conducting NJNG's business, management focuses on factors it believes may have significant influence on its future financial results. NJNG's policy is to work with all stakeholders, including customers, regulators and policymakers, to achieve favorable results. These factors include the rate of NJNG's customer growth in its service territory, which can be influenced by political and regulatory policies, the delivered cost of natural gas compared with competing fuels, interest rates and general economic and business conditions.\nNJNG's total customers as of September 30, include the following:\n\nDuring fiscal 2017, NJNG added 9,126 new customers, which represents a new customer growth rate of approximately 1.7 percent. During that same time period, NJNG converted 662 existing customers to natural gas heat and other services. This customer growth, as well as commercial customers who switched from interruptible to firm natural gas service, will contribute approximately $5.5 million, on an annualized basis, to utility gross margin. NJNG also added 8,170 and 7,858 new customers and converted 644\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nand 636 existing customers to natural gas heat and other services during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nIn addition, NJNG currently expects to add approximately 26,000 to 28,000 new customers during the three-year period of fiscal 2018 to 2020. NJNG's estimates are based on information from municipalities and developers, as well as external industry analysts and management's experience. NJNG estimates that approximately 60 percent of the growth will come from new construction markets and 40 percent from customer conversions to natural gas from other fuel sources. This new customer and conversion growth would increase utility gross margin under NJNG's base rates by approximately $5.3 million annually, as calculated under NJNG's CIP tariff. See the Natural Gas Distribution Segment Operating Results section that follows for a definition and further discussion of utility gross margin.\nSAVEGREEN\nSAVEGREEN conducts home energy audits and provides various grants, incentives and financing alternatives, which are designed to encourage the installation of high efficiency heating and cooling equipment and other energy efficiency upgrades. Depending on the specific incentive or approval, NJNG recovers costs associated with the programs over a two to 10-year period through a tariff rider mechanism.\nSince inception, $149.7 million in grants, rebates and loans has been provided to customers, with a total annual recovery of approximately", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nAccounting guidance requires that we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the positions will not be sustained when challenged by taxing authorities. We have no reason to believe that we have any future obligations associated with unrecognized tax benefits, therefore, as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, we have not recorded any liabilities related to uncertain tax positions. Any significant changes to the estimates and judgments with respect to the interpretations, timing or deductibility could result in a material change to earnings and cash flows.\nTo the extent that NJNG invests in property that qualifies for ITCs, the ITC is deferred and amortized to income over the life of the equipment in accordance with regulatory treatment. For our unregulated subsidiaries, we recognize ITCs as a reduction to income tax expense when the property is placed in service.\nTo the extent that the Company invests in property that qualifies for PTCs, the PTC is recognized as a reduction to current federal income tax expense as the PTCs are generated through the production activities of the assets.\nChanges to the federal statutes related to ITCs and PTCs, which have the effect of reducing or eliminating the credits, could have a negative impact on earnings and cash flows.\nEnvironmental Costs\nAt the end of each fiscal year, NJNG, with the assistance of an independent consulting firm, updates the environmental review of its MGP sites, including its potential liability for investigation and remedial action. From this review, NJNG estimates expenditures necessary to remediate and monitor these MGP sites. As of September 30, 2017, NJNG estimated these expenditures will range from approximately $117.6 million to $205.2 million. NJNG's estimate of these liabilities is developed from then currently available facts, existing technology and current laws and regulations.\nIn accordance with accounting standards for contingencies, NJNG's policy is to record a liability when it is probable that the cost will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated. NJNG will determine a range of liabilities and will record the most likely amount. If no point within the range is more likely than any other, NJNG will accrue the lower end of the range. Since we believe that recovery of these expenditures, as well as related litigation costs, is possible through the regulatory process, we have recorded a regulatory asset corresponding to the related accrued liability. Accordingly, NJNG recorded an MGP remediation liability and a corresponding regulatory asset of $149 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which is based on the most likely amount. This was reduced from $172 million in fiscal 2016, due to the completion of remediation work at certain sites and a reduction to the remediation scope of work at another site.\nThe actual costs to be incurred by NJNG are dependent upon several factors, including final determination of remedial action, changing technologies and governmental regulations, the ultimate ability of other responsible parties to pay, as well as the potential impact of any litigation and any insurance recoveries. As of September 30, 2017 and 2016, $28.5 million and $19.6 million of previously incurred remediation costs, net of recoveries from customers and insurance proceeds received, are included in regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively.\nIf there are changes in the regulatory position surrounding these costs, or should actual expenditures vary significantly from estimates in that these costs are disallowed for recovery by the BPU, such costs would be charged to income in the period of such determination.\nPostemployment Employee Benefits\nOur costs of providing postemployment employee benefits are dependent upon numerous factors, including actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Postemployment employee benefit costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age, compensation levels and employment periods, the level of contributions made to the plans, changes in long-term interest rates and the return on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans or healthcare legislation may also impact current and future postemployment employee benefit costs. Postemployment employee benefit costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, changes in mortality tables, health care cost trends and discount rates used in determining the PBO. In determining the PBO and cost amounts, assumptions can change from period to period and could result in material changes to net postemployment employee benefit periodic costs and the related liability recognized by us.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nOur postemployment employee benefit plan assets consist primarily of U.S. equity securities, international equity securities and fixed-income investments, with a targeted allocation of 40 percent, 20 percent and 40 percent, respectively. Fluctuations in actual market returns, as well as changes in interest rates, may result in increased or decreased postemployment employee benefit costs in future periods. Postemployment employee benefit expenses are included in O&M expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following is a summary of a sensitivity analysis for each actuarial assumption:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension Plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actuarial Assumptions\n</td> <td>Increase/\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>Estimated\nIncrease/(Decrease) on PBO\n(Thousands)\n</td> <td>Estimated\nIncrease/(Decrease) to Expense\n(Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38,398\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,875\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>(1.00\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,493\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>(1.00\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Postemployment Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actuarial Assumptions\n</td> <td>Increase/\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>Estimated\nIncrease/(Decrease) on PBO\n(Thousands)\n</td> <td>Estimated\nIncrease/(Decrease) to Expense\n(Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25,977\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,447\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>(1.00\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(615\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>(1.00\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actuarial Assumptions\n</td> <td>Increase/\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>Estimated\nIncrease/(Decrease) on PBO\n(Thousands)\n</td> <td>Estimated\nIncrease/(Decrease) to Expense\n(Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health care cost trend rate\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health care cost trend rate\n</td> <td>(1.00\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25,466\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,624\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn October 1, 2016, we changed our approach used to measure the service and interest cost components of its net periodic benefit costs. Previously, the Company estimated service cost and interest cost based on a single weighted-average discount rate from the yield curve used to measure its projected benefit obligation. Effective October 1, 2016, we determine our service and interest cost based upon duration specific spot rates that are aligned to each year's future benefit payments. Under the new approach, net periodic benefit costs will be lower during periods of low interest rates and upward-sloping yield curves. Conversely, in a downward sloping-yield curve environment, costs could increase. Refer to Note 11. Employee Benefit Plans in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our change in method.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe recognize AROs related to the costs associated with cutting and capping NJNG's main and service gas distribution mains, which is required by New Jersey law when taking such gas distribution mains out of service. We also recognize AROs associated with Clean Energy Ventures' solar and wind assets when there are decommissioning provisions in lease agreements that require removal of the asset at the end of the lease term.\nAROs are initially recognized when the legal obligation to retire an asset has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The discounted fair value is recognized as an ARO liability with a corresponding amount capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the underlying asset. The obligation is subsequently accreted to the future value of the expected retirement cost and the corresponding asset retirement cost is depreciated over the life of the related asset. Accretion expense associated with Clean Energy Ventures' ARO is recognized as a component of operations and maintenance expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior to October 1, 2016, accretion amounts associated with NJNG's ARO were not reflected as an expense, but rather were deferred as a regulatory asset and netted against NJNG's regulatory liabilities for presentation purposes. Through NJNG's new base rates settlement, effective October 1, 2016, accretion is recognized as part of its depreciation expense and the corresponding regulatory asset and liability will be shown gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nEstimating future removal costs requires management to make significant judgments because most of the removal obligations span long time frames and removal may be conditioned upon future events. Asset removal technologies are also constantly changing, which makes it difficult to estimate removal costs. Accordingly, inherent in the estimate of our AROs are various assumptions including the ultimate settlement date, expected cash outflows, inflation rates, credit-adjusted risk-free rates and consideration of potential outcomes where settlement of the ARO can be conditioned upon events. In the latter case, we develop possible retirement scenarios and assign probabilities based on management's reasonable judgment and knowledge of industry practice. Accordingly, AROs are subject to change.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recently issued accounting standards.\nManagement's Overview\nConsolidated\nNJR is an energy services holding company providing retail natural gas service in New Jersey and wholesale natural gas and related energy services to customers in the United States and Canada. In addition, we invest in clean energy projects, midstream assets and provide various repair, sales and installations services. A more detailed description of our organizational structure can be found in Item 1. Business.\nReporting Segments\nWe have four primary reporting segments as presented in the chart below:\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nIn addition to our four reporting segments, we have non-utility operations that either provide corporate support services or do not meet the criteria to be treated as a separate reporting segment. These operations, which comprise Home Services and Other, include: appliance repair services, sales and installations at NJRHS; and commercial real estate holdings at CR&R.\nA summary of our consolidated results in net income and assets by reporting segment and operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, is as follows:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Income\n</td> <td>Assets\n</td> <td>Net Income\n</td> <td>Assets\n</td> <td>Net Income\n</td> <td>Assets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural Gas Distribution\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,519,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,517,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,305,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clean Energy Ventures\n</td> <td>24,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>771,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>665,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>504,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy Services\n</td> <td>476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>398,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>327,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>260,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Midstream\n</td> <td>12,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>232,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home Services and Other\n</td> <td>6,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intercompany (1)\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(108,295\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(87,899\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(672\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(56,729\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,928,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,718,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,284,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Consists of transactions between subsidiaries that are eliminated in consolidation. \nNet Income\nThe primary drivers of the changes noted above, which are described in more detail in the individual segment discussions, are discussed below.\nThe increase in net income of $393,000 during fiscal 2017, compared with fiscal 2016, was primarily driven by increased gross margin at our Natural Gas Distribution segment due primarily to increased base rates which were effective October 1, 2016, increased other income at Home Services and Other due to the sale of available for sale securities and increased equity in earnings of affiliates at Midstream. These increases were partially offset by decreased operating income at Energy Services due primarily to a decrease of $16.4 million related to changes in the value of financial hedges and a decrease at Clean Energy Ventures due primarily to increased depreciation, operating and interest expenses, partially offset by increased revenues and increased PTCs.\nThe decrease in net income of $49.3 million during fiscal 2016, compared with fiscal 2015, was primarily driven by a decrease at Energy Services related to lower operating income due primarily to a decrease of $59.7 million related to changes in the value of financial hedges. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $8.3 million at Clean Energy Ventures due primarily to operating revenue related to higher SREC and electricity sales, partially offset by increased costs related to depreciation, O&M and interest expense.\nAssets\nThe increase in assets during fiscal 2017, compared with fiscal 2016, was due primarily to additional solar expenditures at Clean Energy Ventures, the acquisition of Talen's wholesale and retail energy contract assets at Energy Services, increased PennEast capital contributions and an increase in the market value of our DM Common Units at Midstream, along with additional utility plant expenditures at our Natural Gas Distribution segment. The increase in assets during fiscal 2016, compared with fiscal 2015, was due primarily to additional utility plant expenditures at Natural Gas Distribution and additional solar expenditures at Clean Energy Ventures, as well as increased broker margin and gas in storage at Energy Services.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur management uses NFE, a non-GAAP financial measure, when evaluating our operating results. Energy Services economically hedges its natural gas inventory with financial derivative instruments. NFE is a measure of the earnings based on eliminating timing differences surrounding the recognition of certain gains or losses, to effectively match the earnings effects of the economic hedges with the physical sale of gas and, therefore, eliminates the impact of volatility to GAAP earnings associated with the derivative instruments. To the extent we utilize forwards, futures, or other derivatives to hedge forecasted SREC production, unrealized gains and losses are also eliminated for NFE purposes.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or a replacement of, the comparable GAAP measure and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results. The following is a reconciliation of consolidated net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to NFE:\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

subsidiaries that are eliminated in consolidation. \nThe increase in NFE during fiscal 2017, compared with fiscal 2016, was due primarily to increases at our Natural Gas Distribution segment, Midstream and Home Services and Other, as previously discussed, partially offset by lower financial margin at Energy Services due primarily to lower sales volumes and fewer market opportunities and the decrease at Clean Energy Ventures, as previously discussed.\nThe decrease in NFE during fiscal 2016, compared with fiscal 2015, was driven primarily by decreased financial margin at Energy Services due primarily to lower volatility and narrower price spreads resulting from the record warm winter weather primarily across the eastern United States, partially offset by lower taxes and O&M, partially offset by higher NFE at Clean Energy Ventures due primarily to increase in SREC and energy sales.\nNatural Gas Distribution Segment\nOverview\nOur Natural Gas Distribution segment is comprised of NJNG, a natural gas utility that provides regulated retail natural gas service in central and northern New Jersey to approximately 529,800 residential and commercial customers in its service territory and also participates in the off-system sales and capacity release markets. The business is subject to various risks, which can negatively impact customer growth, operating and financing costs, fluctuations in commodity prices and customer conservation efforts. These risks include, but are not limited to, adverse economic conditions, customer usage, certain regulatory actions, environmental remediation and severe weather conditions. It is often difficult to predict the impact of events or trends associated with these risks.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nIn addition, NJNG's business is seasonal by nature, as weather conditions directly influence the volume of natural gas delivered to customers on an annual basis. Specifically, customer demand substantially increases during the winter months when natural gas is used for heating purposes. As a result, NJNG receives most of its natural gas distribution revenues during the first and second fiscal quarters and is subject to variations in earnings and working capital during the year.\nAs a regulated company, NJNG is required to recognize the impact of regulatory decisions on its financial statements. See Note 4. Regulation in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion on regulatory actions, including filings related to programs and associated expenditures, as well as rate requests related to recovery of capital investments and operating costs.\nNJNG's operations are managed with the goal of providing safe and reliable service, growing its customer base, diversifying its gross margin, promoting clean energy programs and mitigating the risks discussed above through several key initiatives, including:\n \u2022 earning a reasonable rate of return on the investments in its natural gas distribution and transmission businesses, as well as timely recovery of all prudently incurred costs to provide safe and reliable service throughout NJNG's territory; \n \u2022 continuing to invest in the safety and integrity of its infrastructure; \n \u2022 managing its customer growth rate, which NJNG expects will be approximately 1.7 percent annually through fiscal 2019; \n \u2022 maintaining a collaborative relationship with the BPU on regulatory initiatives, including: \n- planning and authorization of infrastructure investments;\n- pursuing rate and regulatory strategies to stabilize and decouple margin, including CIP;\n- utilizing BGSS incentive programs through BPU-approved mechanisms to reduce gas costs and generate margin; and\n- administering and promoting NJNG's BPU-approved SAVEGREEN Project;\n \u2022 managing the volatility of wholesale natural gas prices through a hedging program designed to keep customers' BGSS rates as stable as possible; and \n \u2022 working with the NJDEP and BPU to manage its financial obligations related to remediation activities associated with its former MGP sites. \nBase Rate Case\nIn September 2016, the BPU approved NJNG's base rate case, effective October 2016, which included the following:\n \u2022 an increase in base rates in the amount of $45 million. The base rate increase includes a return on common equity of 9.75 percent, a common equity ratio of 52.5 percent and an increase in the overall depreciation rate from 2.34 percent to 2.4 percent; \n \u2022 the recovery of SAFE I capital investments and the rate mechanism and five-year extension of SAFE II. The estimated cost for SAFE II extension, excluding AFUDC, is approximately $200 million and related costs to be recovered on an accelerated basis are approximately $157.5 million. As a condition of the extension approval, NJNG is required to file a base rate case no later than November 2019; \n \u2022 rate recovery of NJ RISE capital investment costs through June 30, 2016, and the filing for recovery of future NJ RISE capital investment costs to be recovered, will occur in conjunction with SAFE II, commencing with the rate recovery filing submitted in March 2017; \n \u2022 recovery of NJNG's NGV and LNG plant investments; and \n \u2022 recovery of other costs previously deferred in regulatory assets over seven years. \nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nInfrastructure projects\nNJNG has significant annual capital expenditures associated with the management of its natural gas distribution and transmission system, including new utility plant associated with customer growth and its associated PIM and infrastructure programs.\nBelow is a summary of NJNG's capital expenditures, including accruals and estimates for expected investments over the next two fiscal years:\nEstimated capital expenditures are reviewed on a regular basis and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory oversight, environmental regulations, unforeseen events and the ability to access capital.\nSAFE and NJ RISE\nNJNG continues to implement BPU-approved infrastructure projects that are designed to enhance the reliability and integrity of NJNG's gas distribution system.\nThe BPU approved recovery of SAFE I capital investments through September 30, 2016, and approved the rate mechanism and extension of SAFE II for an additional five years to replace the remaining unprotected steel mains and services from its natural gas distribution system at an estimated cost of approximately $200 million, excluding AFUDC. The accelerated cost recovery methodology for the $157.5 million associated with the extension of SAFE II was approved in NJNG's new base rates. The remaining $42.5 million in capital expenditures will be requested for recovery in a future base rate case.\nThe BPU approved the recovery of NJNG's NJ RISE capital infrastructure program, which consists of six capital investment projects estimated to cost $102.5 million, excluding AFUDC, for gas distribution storm hardening and mitigation projects, along with associated depreciation expense. These system enhancements are intended to minimize service impacts during extreme weather events to customers that live in the most storm prone areas of NJNG's service territory. Recovery of NJ RISE investments through June 30, 2016, is included in NJNG's base rates.\nOn March 30, 2017, NJNG filed its annual petition with the BPU requesting a base rate increase for the recovery of NJ RISE and SAFE II capital investment costs, with a weighted cost of capital of 6.9 percent including a return on equity of 9.75 percent, related to the period ending June 30, 2017, based on estimates, pursuant to the September 2016 base rate case. On July 20,\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\n2017, NJNG filed an update to this petition with actuals, requesting a $4.1 million annual increase in recoveries, which was approved by the BPU, effective October 1, 2017.\nNGV Advantage\nIn June 2012, the BPU approved a pilot program for NJNG to invest up to $10 million to build NGV refueling stations. The NGV program was authorized by the BPU to earn an overall weighted average cost of capital of 7.1 percent, including a return on equity of 10.3 percent. A portion of the proceeds from the utilization of the compressed natural gas equipment, along with any available federal and state incentives, will be credited back to customers to offset a portion of the cost of the NGV investment. All three of the NGV stations are open to the public and NJNG is recovering its costs through base rates effective October 2016.\nLiquefaction/LNG\nIn June 2016, NJNG's Liquefaction facility became operational and allows NJNG to convert natural gas into LNG to fill its existing LNG storage tanks. Costs for this project along with other plant upgrades were approximately $36.5 million and are being recovered through NJNG's new base rates effective October 2016.\nSouthern Reliability Link\nThe SRL is an approximate 30-mile, 30-inch transmission main designed to support improved system reliability and integrity in the southern portion of NJNG's service territory, estimated to cost between $180 million and $200 million. In January 2016, the BPU issued an order approving NJNG's modified, proposed SRL pipeline installation, operation and route selection. In March 2016, the BPU issued an order designating the SRL route and exempting the SRL from municipal land use ordinances, regulations, permits and license requirements. In February 2017, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection issued a permit authorizing construction of the SRL within the jurisdiction of the Coastal Area Facility Review Act, as well as a Freshwater Wetlands permit. On September 14, 2017, the NJ Pinelands Commission approved construction of the SRL as being compliant with the Commission's Comprehensive Management Plan. All approvals and permits have been appealed by third parties. Once the final road opening permits and easements are secured, construction is expected to begin, with an estimated in-service date during the first quarter of fiscal 2019.\nCustomer growth\nIn conducting NJNG's business, management focuses on factors it believes may have significant influence on its future financial results. NJNG's policy is to work with all stakeholders, including customers, regulators and policymakers, to achieve favorable results. These factors include the rate of NJNG's customer growth in its service territory, which can be influenced by political and regulatory policies, the delivered cost of natural gas compared with competing fuels, interest rates and general economic and business conditions.\nNJNG's total customers as of September 30, include the following:\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Firm customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential\n</td> <td>460,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>448,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>437,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial, industrial & other\n</td> <td>26,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential transport\n</td> <td>32,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial transport\n</td> <td>10,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total firm customers\n</td> <td>529,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>521,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>512,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total customers\n</td> <td>529,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>521,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>512,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring fiscal 2017, NJNG added 9,126 new customers, which represents a new customer growth rate of approximately 1.7 percent. During that same time period, NJNG converted 662 existing customers to natural gas heat and other services. This customer growth, as well as commercial customers who switched from interruptible to firm natural gas service, will contribute approximately $5.5 million, on an annualized basis, to utility gross margin. NJNG also added 8,170 and 7,858 new customers and converted 644\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nand 636 existing customers to natural gas heat and other services during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Continued)\nIn addition, NJNG currently expects to add approximately 26,000 to 28,000 new customers during the three-year period of fiscal 2018 to 2020. NJNG's estimates are based on information from municipalities and developers, as well as external industry analysts and management's experience. NJNG estimates that approximately 60 percent of the growth will come from new construction markets and 40 percent from customer conversions to natural gas from other fuel sources. This new customer and conversion growth would increase utility gross margin under NJNG's base rates by approximately $5.3 million annually, as calculated under NJNG's CIP tariff. See the Natural Gas Distribution Segment Operating Results section that follows for a definition and further discussion of utility gross margin.\nSAVEGREEN\nSAVEGREEN conducts home energy audits and provides various grants, incentives and financing alternatives, which are designed to encourage the installation of high efficiency heating and cooling equipment and other energy efficiency upgrades. Depending on the specific incentive or approval, NJNG recovers costs associated with the programs over a two to 10-year period through a tariff rider mechanism.\nSince inception, $149.7 million in grants, rebates and loans has been provided to customers, with a total annual recovery of approximately"}
