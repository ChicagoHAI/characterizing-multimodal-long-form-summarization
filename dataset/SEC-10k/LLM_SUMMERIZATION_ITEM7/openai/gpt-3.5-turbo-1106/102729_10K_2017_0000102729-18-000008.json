MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nForward-Looking Statements\nManagement's discussion and analysis, and other sections of this annual report, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that management has made in light of experience in the industries in which the Company operates, as well as management's perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate under the circumstances. These statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company's control) and assumptions. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions. Many factors could affect the Company's actual financial results and cause them to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, among other things, risk factors described from time to time in the Company's reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as future economic and market circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results, operating efficiencies, availability and price of raw materials, availability and market acceptance of new products, product pricing, domestic and international competitive environments, and actions and policy changes of domestic and foreign governments.\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial position.

</tr>\n</table>\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFISCAL 2017 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2016\nOverview\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, our management and reporting structure changed to reflect management's expectations of future growth of certain product lines and to take into consideration the expected divestiture of the grinding media business, which historically was reported in the Energy and Mining segment. The access systems applications product line is now part of the Engineered Support Structures (\"ESS\") segment and the offshore and other complex structures product line is now part of the Utility segment. Grinding media will be reported in \"Other\" pending the completion of its divestiture. In the first quarter of 2017, we also changed our reportable segment operating income to separate out the LIFO expense (benefit). Certain inventories are accounted for using the LIFO method in the consolidated financial statements. Our segment discussions and segment financial information have been accordingly reclassified in this report to reflect this change, for all periods presented.\nOn a consolidated basis, the increase in net sales in 2017, as compared with 2016, reflected higher sales in all reportable segments. The changes in net sales in 2017, as compared with 2016, were as follows: Table 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>ESS\n</td> <td>Utility\n</td> <td>Coatings\n</td> <td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales - 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,521.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>891.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>735.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>568.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume\n</td> <td>97.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>61.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pricing/mix\n</td> <td>102.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Currency translation\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales - 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,746.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>912.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>856.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>256.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>644.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nVolume effects are estimated based on a physical production or sales measure. Since products we sell are not uniform in nature, pricing and mix relate to a combination of changes in sales prices and the attributes of the product sold. Accordingly, pricing and mix changes do not necessarily directly result in operating income changes.\nAverage steel index prices for both hot rolled coil and plate were higher in North America and China in 2017, as compared to 2016, resulting in higher average cost of material. We expect that average selling prices will increase over time to offset the decrease in gross profit realized from the higher cost of steel for the Company. The Company acquired a highway business in India (\"Aircon\") in the third quarter of 2017 that is included in the ESS segment.\nRestructuring Plan\nIn 2016, we executed a restructuring plan in Australia/New Zealand focused primarily on closing and consolidating locations within the ESS and Coatings segments (the \"2016 Plan\"). We incurred $7.8 million of restructuring expense consisting of $5.0 million in cost of goods sold and $2.8 million in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expense in 2016. The Plan was substantially completed in fiscal 2016.\nIn 2015, we executed a broad restructuring plan (the \"2015 Plan\") to respond to the market environment in certain of our businesses. During 2016, we incurred approximately $4.6 million of restructuring expense to complete the 2015 Plan consisting of $4.1 million in SG&A expense with the remainder recorded in cost of goods sold.\nCurrency Translation\nIn 2017, we realized a benefit to operating profit, as compared with fiscal 2016, due to currency translation effects. The U.S. dollar primarily weakened against the Brazilian real and South African rand, resulting in more operating profit in U.S. dollar terms. The breakdown of this effect by segment was as follows:\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>ESS\n</td> <td>Utility\n</td> <td>Coatings\n</td> <td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>Corporate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit, SG&A, and Operating Income\nAt a consolidated level, the reduction in gross margin (gross profit as a percent of sales) in 2017, as compared with 2016, was primarily due to higher cost of raw materials across most of our businesses. The Utility segment realized an increase in gross margin in 2017, while ESS, Irrigation, and Coatings realized a decrease in gross profit primarily due to sales pricing that did not fully recover higher raw material costs and unfavorable sales mix. Lower volumes for Coatings and Other also contributed to the reduction in gross margin through deleverage of fixed costs.\nThe Company saw an increase within SG&A expense in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to the following:\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>higher employee incentives of $5.0 million due to improved business operations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>reversal of $3.2 million of a contingent consideration liability in 2016 to the former owners of an acquired business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increased project and promotional expenses of $3.2 million, primarily in the irrigation segment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>higher deferred compensation expenses of $2.7 million, which was offset by a decrease of the same amount of other expense; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>currency translation effects of $1.9 million (higher SG&A) due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, and South African rand against the U.S. dollar.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above increases were partially offset by the following decreases in SG&A expense in 2017 as compared to 2016:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>restructuring expenses incurred in 2016 totaling $6.8 million; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>reversal of an environmental remediation liability of $2.6 million related to land of a former galvanizing operation in Australia that was sold in 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2017, as compared to 2016, operating income for all operating segments were higher except for the ESS segment and Other. The increase in operating income in 2017, as compared to 2016, is primarily attributable to increased sales volumes in the Utility and Irrigation segments, along with restructuring expenses incurred in 2016 and the associated benefits of the restructuring activities.\nNet Interest Expense and Debt\nNet interest expense in 2017, as compared to 2016, was lower as interest income increased due to more cash on hand to invest. Long-term and short-term borrowings were consistent year-over-year.\nOther Income/Expense\nThe decrease in other income in 2017, as compared to 2016, is primarily due to the reversal of a contingent liability provision of approximately $16.6 million in 2016, out of \"Other noncurrent liabilities.\"\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective income tax rate in 2017 and 2016 was 46.5% and 19.1%, respectively. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"2017 Tax Act\" or Act\u201d) includes a number of changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code that impact corporations beginning in 2018; including a reduction in the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, limiting or eliminating certain tax deductions, and changing the taxation of unremitted foreign earnings. Accordingly, the Company recorded a one-time charge of approximately $42 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the transition effects of the Act. Excluding this charge, our effective tax rate would have been 28.1% for 2017. The $42 million charge is comprised of (a) approximately $9.9 million of expense related to the taxation of unremitted foreign earnings, the federal portion of which is payable over eight (8) years beginning in 2018, (b) approximately $20.4 million of expense related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax balances to reflect the new U.S. corporate income tax rate, using a federal and state tax rate of 25.0%, and (c) approximately $11.7 million of deferred expenses related to foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes.\nThese amounts are provisional and our estimates and overall impact of the Act may change for various reasons including, but not limited to, changes in our interpretation and assumptions, additional guidance that may be issued by governing authorities, and tax planning actions we may undertake. We continue to gather additional information to fully account for the Act. Any updates and changes in the estimates will be communicated in future quarterly financial statements.\nTax expense in 2016 included $30.6 million of deferred income tax benefit attributable to the remeasurement of the deferred tax asset related to the Company's U.K. defined benefit pension plan. In addition, we recorded a $9.9 million valuation allowance against a tax credit for which we believe we are not likely to receive the benefit in 2016. Excluding these items as well as the impact of the reversal of the contingent liability of $16.6 million that is not taxable, our adjusted effective tax rate was 30.8% for 2016 versus the GAAP reported effective tax rate of 19.1%.\nEarnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was higher in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to improved earnings for our majority-owned irrigation businesses.\nCash Flows from Operations\nOur cash flows provided by operations was $145.7 million in 2017, as compared with $219.2 million provided by operations in 2016. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to less favorable working capital changes driven by higher receivables and inventory and higher contributions to the Delta Pension Plan in 2017.\nEngineered Support Structures (ESS) segment\nThe increase in sales in 2017, as compared with 2016, was due to improved roadway product sales volumes and communication product line sales volumes. Global lighting and traffic, and roadway product sales in 2017 were higher compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016, primarily due to increased sales volumes in roadway product sales, which is a product line outside of North America. In 2017, as compared to 2016, sales volumes in the U.S. were lower across commercial and transportation markets. The 2015 long-term U.S. highway bill has not yet provided a meaningful uplift for our North America structures business. Sales in Europe were lower in 2017 as the domestic markets in general remain subdued. The increase in sales for global lighting and traffic, and roadway product is also attributed to currency translation effects and the acquisition of Aircon in the third quarter of 2017.\nCommunication product line sales were higher in 2017, as compared with 2016. In North America and Asia-Pacific, communication structure and component sales increased due to higher demand from the continued network expansion by providers.\nAccess systems product line net sales in 2017 were higher than in 2016, due to higher average sales prices and favorable currency translation effects.\nGross profit, as a percentage of sales, and operating income for the segment were lower in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to margin contraction from higher raw material costs that the business was not able to fully recover through higher sales pricing. SG&A spending was lower in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to lower commissions owed on communication product line sales, reduced incentives due to decreased operating performance, and restructuring costs and activities undertaken in 2016 to reduce the cost structure primarily in the access systems business in Australia.\nUtility Support Structures (Utility) segment\nIn the Utility segment, sales increased in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to improved volumes and higher sales prices due to steel cost increases and a favorable sales mix. A number of our sales contracts contain provisions that tie the sales price to published steel index pricing at the time our customer issues their purchase order. Improved sales demand in North America resulted in increased sales volumes in tons for both steel and concrete utility structures that also contributed to the increase in sales. International utility structures sales decreased in 2017 due to lower volumes.\nOffshore and other complex structures sales decreased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to lower volumes that were partially offset by favorable currency translation effects.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to improved pricing and sales mix and higher sales volumes in North America and improved factory performance for the offshore and other complex structures business. SG&A expense was higher in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to higher incentive expense due to improved\noperations and commission expense attributed to the increased sales volumes. Operating income increased in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to the increased sales volumes and improved pricing and sales mix in North America.\nCoatings segment\nCoatings segment sales increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to increased sales prices to recover higher zinc costs globally. External sales volumes decreased while intercompany volumes increased in North America during 2017. In the Asia-Pacific region, improved demand/volume in Australia along with currency transaction effects led to an increase in sales in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nSG&A expense was lower in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to lower compensation costs and no restructuring expense in 2017. Both 2017 and 2016 had non-recurring transactions recognized as reductions in SG&A. A former galvanizing operation in Australia was sold in 2017 allowing for a reversal of an environmental remediation liability of $2.6 million. In 2016, a contingent consideration liability to the former owners of an acquired business was reduced $3.2 million due to changes in estimated earnings over the earn-out period. Operating income was higher in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to lower SG&A expenses.\nIrrigation segment\nThe increase in Irrigation segment net sales in 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to sales volume increases for both domestic and international irrigation and currency translation effects. In North America, when comparing 2017 to 2016, sales volumes increased driven by markets outside the traditional corn-belt. In addition, higher equipment running times due to weather conditions resulted in higher service parts sales. International sales increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to volume increases in the Middle East and South America and favorable foreign currency translation effects for Brazil and South Africa.\nSG&A was higher in 2017, as compared with 2016. The increase can be attributed to higher incentive and commission costs due to improved business results, increased product development and promotional expenses, and currency translation effects related to the international irrigation business. Gross profit and operating income for the segment increased in 2017 over 2016, primarily due to North America and international irrigation sales volume increases and favorable foreign currency translation effects.\nOther\nGrinding media sales decreased from lower volumes. A decrease in sales volumes was partially offset by higher sales pricing and favorable currency translation effects. Gross profit and operating income were lower in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to lower volumes.\nLIFO expense\nSteel index prices for both hot rolled coil, plate, and zinc in the U.S. increased at a higher rate in 2017, as compared to 2016, which drove higher LIFO expense.\nNet corporate expense\nNet corporate expense is similar when comparing 2017 to 2016. Approximately $4 million of increased incentive expense was offset by lower pension expense and better performance of the Company's U.S. medical plan as compared to 2016.\nFISCAL 2016 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2015\nOverview\nThe Company's reported net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016 was impacted by a decrease in net sales ($97.2 million) and restructuring expenses (pre-tax $12.4 million). Reported net earnings for the year ended December 26, 2015 included restructuring expenses (pre-tax $39.9 million) and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets (pre-tax $42.0 million).\nOn a consolidated basis, the decrease in net sales in 2016, as compared with 2015, reflected lower sales in all reportable segments except for the ESS segment. In fiscal 2016, the Company had 53 weeks of operations while fiscal 2015 and 2014 had 52 weeks of operations. The estimated impact on the company's results of operations due to the extra week in fiscal 2016 was additional net sales of approximately $50 million and additional net earnings of approximately $3 million.\nThe changes in net sales in 2016, as compared with 2015, was due to the following factors:\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>ESS\n</td> <td>Utility\n</td> <td>Coatings\n</td> <td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales - 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,618.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>880.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>777.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>255.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>605.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume\n</td> <td>(13.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>38.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(29.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(14.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pricing/mix\n</td> <td>(60.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(13.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(44.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Currency translation\n</td> <td>(29.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(14.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(9.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales - 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,521.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>891.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>735.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>568.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nVolume effects are estimated based on a physical production or sales measure. Since products we sell are not uniform in nature, pricing and mix relate to a combination of changes in sales prices and the attributes of the product sold. Accordingly, pricing and mix changes do not necessarily directly result in operating income changes.\nRestructuring Plan\nIn 2016, we executed a restructuring plan in Australia/New Zealand focused primarily on closing and consolidating locations within the ESS and Coatings segments (the \"2016 Plan\"). We incurred approximately $7.8 million of restructuring expense consisting of $5.0 million in cost of goods sold and $2.8 million in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expense in 2016. The Plan was substantially completed in fiscal 2016.\nIn April 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a broad restructuring plan (the \"2015 Plan\") to respond to the market environment in certain of our businesses. During 2016, we incurred approximately $4.6 million of restructuring expense to complete the 2015 Plan consisting of $4.1 million in SG&A expense with the remainder recorded in cost of goods sold.\nInclusive of both the 2016 and 2015 Plans, operating income in 2016 was reduced due to restructuring expense by segment as follows:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>ESS\n</td> <td>Utility\n</td> <td>Coatings\n</td> <td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>Corporate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill and Trade Name Impairment\nThe Company recognized a $16.2 million impairment of goodwill on the APAC Coatings reporting unit during fiscal 2015, which represented all of the remaining goodwill on this reporting unit. The goodwill impairment was the result of difficulties in the Australian market over the last couple of years, including a general slowdown in manufacturing. In\naddition, the Company also recorded a $1.1 million impairment of the Industrial Galvanizing trade name (in the Coatings segment) and a $5.8 million impairment of the Webforge trade name (in the ESS segment) during 2015. The Company also recognized an $18.8 million goodwill impairment of its Access Systems reporting unit due to continued downward pressure on oil and natural gas prices which in turn reduces the prospects for new oil and gas exploration primarily in Australia and Southeast Asia.\nCurrency Translation\nIn 2016, we realized a decrease in operating profit of $1.6 million, as compared with 2015, due to currency translation effects. On average, the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies and in particular against the Australian dollar, Brazilian Real, Euro, and South African Rand, resulting in less operating profit in U.S. dollar terms. The breakdown of this effect by segment was as follows: Table 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>ESS\n</td> <td>Utility\n</td> <td>Coatings\n</td> <td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>Corporate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit, SG&A, and Operating Income\nAt a consolidated level, the improvement in gross margin (gross profit as a percent of sales) in 2016, as compared with 2015, was due to restructuring activities undertaken in 2015 and the $17 million Utility segment commercial settlement recognized in 2015. Gross profit increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, for all operating segments except for Coatings and Irrigation. Gross profit decreased for Coatings and Irrigation primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable currency translation effects. Reduced average selling prices also resulted in a decline in gross profit for the Coatings segment.\nThe Company incurred $6.8 million of restructuring expense in 2016 within SG&A expense, compared to $18.2 million in 2015. Excluding restructuring expense, the Company saw a decrease in SG&A in 2016 of $65.2 million, as compared with 2015, mainly due to the following factors:\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$42.0 million of goodwill and intangible impairments recorded in 2015 which did not recur in 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>reduced doubtful account provisions of $11.1 million, principally in the Irrigation segment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>currency translation effects of $4.7 million (lower SG&A) due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar primarily against the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, and South African rand;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>reversal of $3.2 million of a contingent consideration liability to the former owners of Pure Metal Galvanizing in 2016; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>reductions due to exiting a business development activity, lower project expenses, reduced discretionary spending, and benefits from restructuring activities undertaken in 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above reductions were partially offset by the following increases in SG&A expense in 2016 as compared with 2015:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increased incentive expenses due to improved operating performance of $13.6 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>higher deferred compensation expenses of $1.5 million, which was offset by a decrease of the same amount of other expense; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increased pension expenses of $2.5 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2016 as compared to 2015, operating income improved for all operating segments. The increase in operating income is primarily attributable to reduced expenses for restructuring activities and the associated benefits of the restructuring activities, no goodwill or intangible asset impairments in 2016, lower doubtful account provisions, and reduced overall SG&A spending.\nNet Interest Expense and Debt\nNet interest expense in 2016, as compared to 2015, was consistent due to minimal changes in short and long-term borrowings.\nOther Expense\nThe increase in other income in 2016 is a result of the reversal of a contingent liability provision, approximately $16.6 million, out of \"Other noncurrent liabilities.\" This liability was originally recorded as part of the Delta purchase accounting in 2010 to address a certain contingent liability. The statutes of limitation have expired and we now determine this matter to be remote.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective income tax rates were 19.1% and 51.0% in 2016 and 2015. Fiscal 2016 includes $30.6 million of deferred income tax benefit attributable to the re-measurement of the deferred tax asset related to the Company's U.K. defined benefit pension plan. In addition, in fiscal 2016 we recorded a $9.9 million valuation allowance against a tax credit for which we believe we are not likely to receive the benefit. Excluding these items as well as the impact of the reversal of the contingent liability of $16.6 million that is not taxable, our adjusted effective tax rate was 30.8% for 2016. The fiscal 2015 rate is unusually high primarily due to the APAC Coatings and Access Systems goodwill impairments recorded that are not deductible for tax purposes. In addition, U.K. corporate tax rates were collectively reduced from 20% to 18% in 2015. Accordingly, we reduced the value of our deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards and certain timing differences by $7.1 million, with a corresponding increase in deferred income tax expense. Excluding these items, our adjusted effective tax rate was 32.0% in fiscal 2015.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nEarnings attributable to noncontrolling interest was flat in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nCash Flows from Operations\nCash flows provided by operations were $219.2 million in 2016, as compared with $272.3 million provided by operations in 2015. The decrease in operating cash flow in 2016, as compared with 2015, was the result of higher net working capital and a reduction in noncurrent liabilities that was partially offset by improved net earnings.\nEngineered Support Structures (ESS) segment\nThe increase in sales in 2016 as compared with 2015 was primarily due to improved volumes in our Asia-Pacific Structures businesses. The volume increase was partially offset by unfavorable currency translation effects and lower average selling prices mostly attributed to average lower cost of steel.\nGlobal lighting and traffic, and roadway product sales in 2016 were higher compared to the same periods in fiscal 2015. Sales volumes in the U.S. were higher in the commercial and OEM markets (steel and aluminum), and modestly lower in the transportation markets. We expect the 2015 long-term U.S. highway bill to provide an uplift to the transportation market demand sometime in 2017. Sales in Canada decreased in 2016 as compared to 2015, from lower volumes due to less large projects and unfavorable currency translation. Sales in Europe were lower in 2016 compared to 2015, due to unfavorable currency translation effects and lower volumes primarily related to a large project in the Middle East in 2015. The domestic markets in general remain subdued in Europe, as economic conditions have curtailed infrastructure investment. In the Asia-Pacific (\"APAC\") region, sales were higher in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to improved investment activity in Australia and overall market growth in India. Roadway product sales decreased in 2016 due to lower volumes and unfavorable currency translation effects.\nCommunication product line sales were lower in 2016, as compared with 2015. North America communication structure and component sales decreased, due to lower market demand. In China, sales of wireless communication structures in 2016 increased over the same period in 2015 as the investment levels by the major wireless carriers have remained strong and we have increased our market share through better sales coverage. In Australia, sales for wireless communication structures improved in 2016 due to higher demand from the national broadband network build out.\nAccess systems product line sales in 2016 were lower when compared to 2015. The sales decrease was primarily due to the negative impact of currency translation effects and lower sales prices in Asia. The decrease in sales price is primarily related to fewer oil and gas related construction projects in the APAC region.\nOperating income was higher for the segment in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to goodwill and trade name impairment charges in 2015 associated with the Access Systems reporting unit totaling $24.6 million. Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, for the segment were higher in 2016, as compared with 2015, due to margin expansion from lower average raw material costs, growth in the Asia-Pacific telecommunication business, and lower costs resulting from the 2015 restructuring activities. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation effects and lower sales volumes in Europe and the North American wireless communication businesses. Favorable LIFO inventory valuation reserve adjustments were approximately $4 million lower in 2016 as compared to 2015. SG&A spending in 2016 decreased over the same period in 2015 due primarily to goodwill and trade name impairment charges in 2015 associated with the Access Systems reporting unit, partially offset by increased commissions owed on the higher telecommunication sales in the Asia-Pacific region and higher compensation costs.\nUtility Support Structures (Utility) segment\nIn the Utility segment, sales decreased in 2016 as compared with 2015, due mainly to decreased average selling prices tied to the lower cost of steel and lower international sales volumes. Declining cost of steel during the second half of 2015 and first quarter of 2016 contributed to lower average selling prices for the first three quarters of 2016. A number of our sales contracts contain provisions that tie the sales price to published steel index pricing at the time our customer issues their purchase order.\nIn North America, sales volumes in tons for steel utility structures were higher in 2016, as compared with 2015, while concrete sales volumes in tons decreased during 2016. International utility structures sales volumes were lower in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nOffshore and other complex structures sales increased in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase can be attributed to volume improvements primarily in the wind tower product line. Oil and gas product activity continues to be slow due to low oil prices that caused some previously planned projects to be postponed.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales improved in 2016, as compared to 2015, due to a number of actions taken in 2015 to improve our cost structure and operational efficiency in this segment, including certain restructuring activities involving facility closures. In addition, the segment recorded a $17.0 million reserve in the fourth quarter of 2015 for a commercial settlement with a large customer that requires ongoing quality monitoring. SG&A expense was lower in 2016, as compared with 2015, primarily due to the benefits realized from the 2015 restructuring activities. Operating income increased in 2016, as compared with 2015, primarily due to lower restructuring costs and the related improved cost structure realized in 2016 and the commercial settlement recorded in 2015.\nCoatings segment\nCoatings segment sales in North America decreased in 2016, as compared with 2015, due to lower volumes and less favorable sales pricing mostly due to mix. The decrease was partially offset by the acquisition of American Galvanizing that accounted for $5.9 million of sales. Coatings sales in the Asia-Pacific region were lower in 2016 due to reduced volumes, lower pricing and sales mix, and unfavorable currency translation effects primarily related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar and Malaysian Ringgit.\nSG&A expense was lower in 2016, as compared to 2015, due to $17.3 million of goodwill and trade name impairment charges recorded in 2015 associated with the APAC Coatings reporting unit. In addition, the contingent consideration liability to the former owners of Pure Metal Galvanizing (PMG), payable in calendar 2018, was reduced in 2016 by $3.2 million, due to changes in the estimated earnings over the earn out period. The decrease was partially offset by the SG&A of American Galvanizing, acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. Operating income was higher in 2016, as compared with 2015, due primarily to the impairment charges in 2015 not recurring in 2016, the reduction in the PMG contingent consideration liability in 2016, and income from the American Galvanizing acquisition. These increases were partially offset by reduced volumes in North America and Asia Pacific and less favorable sales mix.\nIrrigation segment\nThe decrease in Irrigation segment net sales in 2016, as compared with 2015, was mainly due to sales volume decreases in North America for both the irrigation and tubing businesses and unfavorable currency translation effects for our international irrigation business. Volume increases for international irrigation partially offset the decrease. In fiscal 2016, net farm income in the United States is expected to decrease 17.2% from the levels of 2015, due in part to lower market prices for corn and soybeans. The 2016 estimate represents the third consecutive year of a decrease in estimated net farm income. We believe this reduction contributed to lower demand for irrigation machines in North America in 2016 as compared with\n2015. In international markets, sales volumes increased in 2016 over 2015 due to volume improvements in all regions except for Australia and China. The volume improvements were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation effects of $9.5 million primarily related to the South African rand and Brazilian real.\nSG&A was lower in 2016 as compared with 2015, and is primarily attributed to approximately $10.5 million of lower provisions for uncollected international receivables. In 2015, the Company recorded a provision of approximately $8.0 million primarily related to delinquent receivables with a Chinese municipal entity. In addition, currency translation and lower overall discretionary spending contributed to lower SG&A. The decreases were partially offset by increased compensation and incentive expenses due primarily to improved international irrigation operations. Operating income for the segment improved in 2016 over 2015, due to lower provisions for uncollected international receivables and lower discretionary spending, partially offset by lower volumes and a higher LIFO inventory reserve due to higher steel prices in 2016.\nOther\nGrinding media sales were down in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable currency translation effects. The volume decreases are primarily related to the continued slowdown in the Australia mining sector. Gross profit and operating income improved primarily due to an improved sales mix.\nLIFO expense\nSteel index prices for both hot rolled coil and plate in the U.S. increased in 2016 whereas they declined significantly in 2015. As a result, the Company had LIFO benefit in 2015 but LIFO expense recognized in 2016.\nNet corporate expense\nNet corporate expense in 2016 decreased compared to 2015. The decrease was mainly due to the following:\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>lower restructuring expenses of $4.5 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>lower compensation expenses of $3.8 million due primarily to lower employment levels; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>reduced discretionary spending.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above decreases were partially offset by approximately $7.7 million of higher incentive costs in 2016 due to improved operations, $2.5 million of higher pension expense for the Delta Pension Plan, and increased deferred compensation expenses of $1.5 million, which was offset by the same amount of other expense.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash Flows\nWorking Capital and Operating Cash Flows-Net working capital was $1,069.6 million at December 30, 2017, as compared with $903.4 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in net working capital in 2017 mainly resulted from higher cash balances, along with higher receivables and inventory due to improved sales, higher costs of materials, and additional inventory on-hand to support sales growth and higher year-end backlogs. Operating cash flow was $145.7 million in 2017, as compared with $219.2 million in 2016 and $272.3 million in 2015. The decrease in operating cash flow in 2017, as compared to 2016, was due to less favorable working capital changes driven by higher receivables and inventory and higher contributions to the Delta Pension Plan in 2017. The decrease in operating cash flow in 2016, as compared to 2015, was due to less favorable working capital changes including receivables, accrued expenses primarily due to a reduced warranty accrual, and other noncurrent liabilities due to the reversal of a contingent liability related to the Delta acquisition. The decreases were partially offset by higher net earnings and a lower pension contribution in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nInvesting Cash Flows-Capital spending in fiscal 2017 was $55.3 million, as compared with $57.9 million in fiscal 2016 and $45.5 million in fiscal 2015. Capital spending projects in 2017 included investments in machinery and equipment across all businesses. We expect our capital spending for the 2018 fiscal year to be approximately $70 million. Investing cash flows included $5.4 million paid for Aircon in 2017 and $12.8 million paid for American Galvanizing in 2015.\nFinancing Cash Flows-Our total interest-bearing debt decreased to $755.0 million at December 30, 2017, from $756.4 million at December 31, 2016. During 2016 and 2015, we acquired approximately 0.4 million shares and 1.4 million shares for approximately $53.8 million and $169.0 million, respectively, under the share repurchase program. No shares were repurchased in 2017.\nCapital Allocation Philosophy\nWe have historically funded our growth, capital spending and acquisitions through a combination of operating cash flows and debt financing. On May 13, 2014, our Board of Directors approved and publicly announced a capital allocation philosophy with the following priorities for cash generated:\n\u2022working capital and capital expenditure investments necessary for future sales growth;\n\u2022dividends on common stock in the range of 15% of the prior year's fully diluted net earnings;\n\u2022acquisitions; and\n\u2022return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases.\nWe also announced our intention to manage our capital structure to maintain our investment grade debt rating. Our most recent ratings were Baa3 by Moody's Investors Services, Inc. and BBB+ by Standard and Poor's Rating Services. We would be willing to allow our debt rating to fall to Baa3 or BBB- to finance a special acquisition or other opportunity. We expect to maintain a ratio of debt to invested capital which will support our current investment grade debt rating.\nThe Board of Directors in May 2014 authorized the purchase of up to $500 million of the Company's outstanding common stock from time to time over twelve months at prevailing market prices, through open market or privately-negotiated transactions. In February 2015, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $250 million of share purchases, without an expiration date. The purchases will be funded from available working capital and short-term borrowings and will be made subject to market and economic conditions. We are not obligated to make any repurchases and may discontinue the program at any time. As of December 30, 2017, we have acquired approximately 4.6 million shares for approximately $617.8 million under these share repurchase programs.\nSources of Financing\nOur debt financing at December 30, 2017 consisted primarily of long-term debt. During 2014, the Company issued $500 million of new notes and repurchased by partial tender $199.8 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 notes. Our long-term debt as of December 30, 2017, principally consists of:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$250.2 million face value ($252.7 million carrying value) of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at 6.625% per annum and are due in April 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$250 million face value ($248.9 million carrying value) of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at 5.00% per annum and are due in October 2044.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$250 million face value ($246.8 million carrying value) of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at 5.25% per annum and are due in October 2054.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We are allowed to repurchase the notes subject to the payment of a make-whole premium.

The credit facility provides for $600 million of committed unsecured revolving credit loans. We may increase the credit facility by up to an additional $200 million at any time, subject to lenders increasing the amount of their commitments. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries Valmont Industries Holland B.V. and Valmont Group Pty. Ltd., along with the Company, are borrowers under the credit facility. The obligations arising under the credit facility are guaranteed by the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries PiRod, Inc., Valmont Coatings, Inc., Valmont Newmark, Inc. and Valmont Queensland Pty. Ltd.\nThe material amendments to the credit facility, which are set forth in the amended and restated credit agreement, include:\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an extension of the maturity date of the credit facility from October 17, 2019 to October 18, 2022;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase in the available borrowings in foreign currencies from $200 million to $400 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a modification of the definition of \"EBITDA\" to add-back non-recurring cash and non-cash restructuring costs in an amount that does not exceed $75 million in any trailing twelve month period;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a modification of the leverage ratio permitting it to increase from 3.5X to 3.75X for the four consecutive fiscal quarters after certain material acquisitions; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>updating the credit facility with certain market provisions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The interest rate on our borrowings will be, at our option, either:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>LIBOR (based on a 1, 2, 3 or 6 month interest period, as selected by us) plus 100 to 162.5 basis points, depending on the credit rating of our senior debt published by Standard & Poor's Rating Services and Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table> (b) the higher of\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the prime lending rate,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td> the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>LIBOR (based on a 1 month interest period) plus 100 basis points (inclusive of facility fees),\n</td> </tr>\n</table> plus, in each case, 0 to 62.5 basis points, depending on the credit rating of our senior debt published by Standard & Poor's Rating Services and Moody's Investors Service, Inc.\nA commitment fee is also required under the revolving credit facility which accrues at 10 to 25 basis points, depending on the credit rating of our senior debt published by Standard and Poor's Rating Services and Moody's Investor Services, Inc., on the average daily unused portion of the commitment under the revolving credit facility.\nAt December 30, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility has a maturity date of October 18, 2022 and contains certain financial covenants that may limit our additional borrowing capability under the agreement. At December 30, 2017, we had the ability to borrow $585.2 million under this facility, after consideration of standby letters of credit of $14.8 million associated with certain insurance obligations. We also maintain certain short-term bank lines of credit totaling $113.4 million; $113.3 million of which was unused at December 30, 2017.\nOur senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreement each contain cross-default provisions which permit the acceleration of our indebtedness to them if we default on other indebtedness that results in, or permits, the acceleration of such other indebtedness.\nThese debt agreements contain covenants that require us to maintain certain coverage ratios and may limit us with respect to certain business activities, including capital expenditures. These debt agreements allow us to add estimated EBITDA from acquired businesses for periods we did not own the acquired businesses. The debt agreements also provide for an adjustment to EBITDA, subject to certain specified limitations, for non-cash charges or gains that are non-recurring in nature. For 2017, our covenant calculations do not include any estimated EBITDA from acquired businesses.\nOur key debt covenants are as follows:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Leverage ratio - Interest-bearing debt is not to exceed 3.50x Adjusted EBITDA (or 3.75x Adjusted EBITDA after certain material acquisitions) of the prior four quarters; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Interest earned ratio - Adjusted EBITDA over the prior four quarters must be at least 2.50x our interest expense over the same period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants related to these debt agreements. The key covenant calculations at December 30, 2017 were as follows:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>755,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA-last four quarters\n</td> <td>351,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leverage ratio\n</td> <td>2.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA-last four quarters\n</td> <td>351,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense-last four quarters\n</td> <td>44,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest earned ratio\n</td> <td>7.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe calculation of Adjusted EBITDA-last four quarters is presented under the column for fiscal 2017 in footnote (b) to the table \"Selected Five-Year Financial Data\" in Item 6 - Selected Financial Data.\nOur businesses are cyclical, but we have diversity in our markets, from a product, customer and a geographical standpoint. We have demonstrated the ability to effectively manage through business cycles and maintain liquidity. We have consistently generated operating cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures. Based on our available credit facilities, recent issuance of senior unsecured notes and our history of positive operational cash flows, we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our needs for fiscal 2018 and beyond.\nWe previously considered the earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, recorded no related deferred income taxes. Prior to the 2017 Tax Act, we had an excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries, including unremitted foreign earnings of approximately $400 million. While the tax on these foreign earnings imposed by the 2017 Tax Act ( Transition Tax\u201d) resulted in the reduction of the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries, an actual repatriation from our non-U.S. subsidiaries may still be subject to foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes.\nAs a result of the 2017 Tax Act, we have reassessed our position with respect to the approximately $400 million of unremitted foreign earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have taken the position that our previously deferred earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries that were subject to the Transition Tax are not indefinitely reinvested. Of our cash balances of $492.8 million at December 29, 2017, approximately $405.0 million is held in our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Consequently, with the change in our position on unremitted foreign earnings, if we distributed our foreign cash balances certain taxes would be applicable. Therefore, we have recorded deferred income taxes for foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes of $10.4 million and $1.3 million respectively. Our estimates and the overall impact of the Act may change for various reasons including, but not limited to, changes in our interpretation and assumptions, additional guidance that may be issued by governing authorities, and tax planning actions we may undertake. We continue to gather additional information to fully account for the Act. Any updates and changes in the estimates will be communicated in future quarterly financial statements.\nFINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS\nWe have future financial obligations related to (1) payment of principal and interest on interest-bearing debt, (2) Delta pension plan contributions, (3) operating leases and (4) purchase obligations. These obligations at December 30, 2017 were as follows (in millions of dollars):\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019-2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021-2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>762.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>508.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>856.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>689.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Delta pension plan contributions\n</td> <td>136.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>99.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unconditional purchase commitments\n</td> <td>62.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,918.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>386.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,299.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-term debt mainly consisted of $750.2 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes. At December 30, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings under our bank revolving credit agreement. Obligations under these agreements may be accelerated in event of non-compliance with debt covenants. The Delta pension plan contributions are related to the current cash funding commitments to the plan with the plan's trustees. The Company prepaid its 2018 contribution to the Delta pension plan in December 2017. Operating leases relate mainly to various production and office facilities and are in the normal course of business.\nUnconditional purchase commitments relate to purchase orders for zinc, aluminum and steel, all of which we plan to use in 2018, and certain capital investments planned for 2018. We believe the quantities under contract are reasonable in light of normal fluctuations in business levels and we expect to use the commodities under contract during the contract period.\nAt December 30, 2017, we had approximately $23.5 million of various long-term liabilities related to certain income tax, environmental, and other matters. These items are not scheduled above because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the timing of any potential payments.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe have operating lease obligations to unaffiliated parties on leases of certain production and office facilities and equipment. These leases are in the normal course of business and generally contain no substantial obligations for us at the end of the lease contracts. We also maintain standby letters of credit for contract performance on certain sales contracts.\nMARKET RISK\nChanges in Prices\nCertain key materials we use are commodities traded in worldwide markets and are subject to fluctuations in price. The most significant materials are steel, aluminum, zinc and natural gas. Over the last several years, prices for these commodities have been volatile. The volatility in these prices was due to such factors as fluctuations in supply and demand conditions, government tariffs and the costs of steel-making inputs. Steel is most significant for our utility support structures segment where the cost of steel has been approximately 50% of the net sales, on average. Assuming a similar sales mix, a hypothetical 20% change in the price of steel would have affected our net sales from our utility support structures segment by approximately $66 million for the year ended December 30, 2017.\nWe have also experienced volatility in natural gas prices in the past several years. Our main strategies in managing these risks are a combination of fixed price purchase contracts with our vendors to reduce the volatility in our purchase prices and sales price increases where possible. We use natural gas swap contracts on a limited basis to mitigate the impact of rising gas prices on our operating income.\nRisk Management\nMarket Risk-The principal market risks affecting us are exposure to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and natural gas. We normally do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures (except as described below), nor do we use derivatives for trading purposes.\nInterest Rates-Our interest-bearing debt at December 30, 2017 was mostly fixed rate debt. Our notes payable and a small portion of our long-term debt accrue interest at a variable rate. Assuming average interest rates and borrowings on variable rate debt, a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would have affected our interest expense in 2017 and 2016 by approximately $0.1 million. Likewise, we have excess cash balances on deposit in interest-bearing accounts in financial institutions. An increase or decrease in interest rates of ten basis points would have impacted our annual interest earnings in 2017 and 2016 by approximately $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively.\nForeign Exchange-Exposures to transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity's functional currency are not material, and therefore the potential exchange losses in future earnings, fair value and cash flows from these transactions are not material. From time to time, as market conditions indicate, we will enter into foreign currency contracts to manage the risks associated with anticipated future transactions and current balance sheet positions that are in currencies other than the functional currencies of our operations. At December 30, 2017, the Company had two open foreign currency\nforward contracts that both qualified as net investment hedges. The purpose of the net investment hedges is to mitigate foreign currency risk on a portion of our foreign subsidiary investments in the grinding media business that are denominated in British pounds and Australian dollars. The divestiture of our grinding media business is currently pending Australia regulatory approval. The forward contracts have a maturity date of January 2018 and a notional amount to sell British pounds and Australian dollars and receive $24.1 million and $21.2 million, respectively. The unrealized loss recorded at December 30, 2017 is $0.8 million and is included in Accounts Payable and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had certain open foreign currency forward contracts, the most significant of which was a one-year foreign currency forward contract which qualified as a net investment hedge, in order to mitigate foreign currency risk on a portion of our foreign subsidiary investments denominated in British pounds. The notional amount of this forward contract to sell British pounds was $44.0 million and the contract was settled in May 2017. At December 26, 2015, the Company had a number of open foreign currency forward contracts, including one related to the interest payments on an intercompany note between two entities with two different functional currencies. The notional amount of this forward contract to sell Australian dollars was $36.6 million and the contract was settled in January 2016. Much of our cash in non-U.S. entities is denominated in foreign currencies, where fluctuations in exchange rates will impact our cash balances in U.S. dollar terms. A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar would impact our reported cash balance by approximately $37.2 million in 2017 and $28.7 million in 2016.\nWe manage our investment risk in foreign operations by borrowing in the functional currencies of the foreign entities where appropriate. The following table indicates the change in the recorded value of our most significant investments at year-end assuming a hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar. Table 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Australian dollar\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chinese renminbi\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Danish krone\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K. pound\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Euro\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canadian dollar\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brazilian real\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommodity risk-Natural gas is a significant commodity used in our factories, especially in our Coatings segment galvanizing operations, where natural gas is used to heat tanks that enable the hot-dipped galvanizing process. Natural gas prices are volatile and we mitigate some of this volatility through the use of derivative commodity instruments. Our current policy is to manage this commodity price risk for 0-50% of our U.S. natural gas requirements for the upcoming 6-12 months through the purchase of natural gas swaps based on NYMEX futures prices for delivery in the month being hedged. The objective of this policy is to mitigate the impact on our earnings of sudden, significant increases in the price of natural gas. At December 30, 2017, we have open natural gas swaps for 80,000 MMBtu.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe following accounting policies involve judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There is a substantial amount of management judgment used in preparing financial statements. We must make estimates on a number of items, such as provisions for bad debts, warranties, contingencies, impairments of long-lived assets, and inventory obsolescence. We base our estimates on our experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Further, we re-evaluate our estimates from time to time and as circumstances change. Actual results may differ under different assumptions or conditions. The selection and application of our critical accounting policies are discussed annually with our audit committee.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nIn determining an allowance for accounts receivable that will not ultimately be collected in full, we consider:\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>age of the accounts receivable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>customer credit history\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>customer financial information\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>reasons for non-payment (product, service or billing issues).\n</td> </tr>\n</table> If our customer's financial condition was to deteriorate, resulting in an impaired ability to make payment, additional allowances may be required. As the Company's international Irrigation business has grown, the exposure to potential losses in international markets has also increased. These exposures can be difficult to estimate, particularly in areas of political instability, or with governments with which the Company has limited experience, or where there is a lack of transparency as to the current credit condition of governmental units. Receivables that are not reasonably expected to be realized in cash within the next twelve months are classified as long-term receivables within other assets. The Company's allowance for doubtful accounts related to both current and long-term accounts receivables is $9.8 million at December 30, 2017.\nWarranties\nAll of our businesses must meet certain product quality and performance criteria. We rely on historical product claims data to estimate the cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. In determining the accrual for the estimated cost of warranty claims, we consider our experience with:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs to correct the product problem in the field, including labor costs\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs for replacement parts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other direct costs associated with warranty claims\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the number of product units subject to warranty claims\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition to known claims or warranty issues, we estimate future claims on recent sales. The key assumptions in our estimates are the rates we apply to those recent sales (which is based on historical claims experience) and our expected future warranty costs for products that are covered under warranty for an extended period of time. Our provision for various product warranties was approximately $20.1 million at December 30, 2017. If our estimate changed by 50%, the impact on operating income would be approximately $10.1 million. If our cost to repair a product or the number of products subject to warranty claims is greater than we estimated, then we would have to increase our accrued cost for warranty claims.\nInventories\nWe use the last-in first-out (LIFO) method to determine the value of approximately 37% of our inventory. The remaining 63% of our inventory is valued on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis. In periods of rising costs to produce inventory, the LIFO method will result in lower profits than FIFO, because higher more recent costs are recorded to cost of goods sold than under the FIFO method. Conversely, in periods of falling costs to produce inventory, the LIFO method will result in higher profits than the FIFO method.\nIn 2017 and 2016, we experienced higher average costs to produce inventory than in the prior year, due mainly to higher cost for steel and steel-related products. This resulted in higher costs of goods sold of approximately $5.7 million in 2017 and $3.0 million in 2016, than if our entire inventory had been valued on the FIFO method. In 2015, we experienced lower costs to produce inventory than in the prior year, due mainly to lower cost for steel and steel-related products. This resulted in lower cost of goods sold (and higher operating income) of approximately $12.0 million in 2015, than had our entire inventory been valued on the FIFO method.\nWe write down slow-moving and obsolete inventory by the difference between the value of the inventory and our estimate of the reduced value based on potential future uses, the likelihood that overstocked inventory will be sold and the expected selling prices of the inventory. If our ability to realize value on slow-moving or obsolete inventory is less favorable than assumed, additional inventory write downs may be required.\nDepreciation, Amortization and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions. We have assigned useful lives to our property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets ranging from 3 to 40 years. In 2015, we determined that our galvanizing operation in Melbourne Australia would not generate sufficient cash flows on an undiscounted cash flow basis to recover its carrying value. We had the fixed assets valued by an appraisal firm and recognized an impairment of approximately $4.1 million. Other impairment losses were recorded in 2015 as facilities were closed and future plans for certain fixed assets changed in connection with our restructuring plans.\nWe identified thirteen reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill and we annually evaluate our reporting units for goodwill impairment during the third fiscal quarter, which usually coincides with our strategic planning process. We assess the value of our reporting units using after-tax cash flows from operations (less capital expenses) discounted to present value and as a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The key assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis are the discount rate and the projected cash flows. We also use sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of changes in discount rates and cash flow forecasts on the valuation of the reporting units. As allowed for under current accounting standards, we rely on our previous valuations for the annual impairment testing provided that the following criteria for each reporting unit are met: (1) the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination and (2) the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin.\nOur most recent impairment test during the third quarter of 2017 showed that the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying value, so no goodwill was impaired. Our offshore and other complex steel structures reporting unit with $14.8 million of goodwill, is the reporting unit that did not have a substantial excess of estimated fair value over its carrying value. The 2017 model assumes continued expansion into other highly engineered steel product offerings, such as utility support structures, where the reporting unit completed profitable projects in the past. We will continue to monitor the outlook for wind energy in Europe which would affect the sales demand assumptions in the five year model for this reporting unit. If demand for off and onshore structures for wind energy declines significantly and oil and natural gas prices do not increase to a level to drive new extraction investment, we will be required to perform an interim impairment test for goodwill. A hypothetical 1% change in the discount rate would increase/decrease the fair value of this reporting unit by approximately $10 million, which approximates the cushion between the estimated fair value and carrying value of this reporting unit.\nIf our assumptions on discount rates and future cash flows change as a result of events or circumstances, and we believe these assets may have declined in value, then we may record impairment charges, resulting in lower profits. Our reporting units are all cyclical and their sales and profitability may fluctuate from year to year. The Company continues to monitor changes in the global economy that could impact future operating results of its reporting units. If such conditions arise, the Company will test a given reporting unit for impairment prior to the annual test. In the evaluation of our reporting units, we look at the long-term prospects for the reporting unit and recognize that current performance may not be the best indicator of future prospects or value, which requires management judgment.\nIn fiscal 2015, we recognized a $16.2 million impairment charge which represented all of the goodwill on the APAC Coatings reporting unit. The forecast for lower prices for oil and natural gas required an interim step 2 test for our Access Systems reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2015. We recognized an $18.7 million impairment of goodwill as a result of that test.\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names. We assess the values of these assets apart from goodwill as part of the annual impairment testing. We use the relief-from-royalty method to evaluate our trade names, under which the value of a trade name is determined based on a royalty that could be charged to a third party for using the trade name in question. The royalty, which is based on a reasonable rate applied against estimated future sales, is tax-effected and discounted to present value. The most significant assumptions in this evaluation include estimated future sales, the royalty rate and the after-tax discount rate. For our evaluation purposes, the royalty rates used vary between 0.5% and 1.5% of sales and the after-tax discount rate of 13.0% to 16.0%, which we estimate to be the after-tax cost of capital for such assets.\nOur trade names were tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2017 where we determined no trade names were impaired. In fiscal 2015, two of our trade names, Webforge (in the ESS segment) and Industrial Galvanizing (in the Coatings segment), were estimated to have a fair value lower than carrying value during the impairment tests. As such, we recognized a $5.8 million impairment of the Webforge trade name and a $1.1 million impairment of the Industrial Galvanizing trade name.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income expectations and tax-planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If we estimate a deferred tax asset is not likely to be fully realized in the future, a valuation allowance to decrease the amount of the deferred tax asset would decrease net earnings in the period the determination was made. Likewise, if we subsequently determine that we are able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment reducing the valuation allowance would increase net earnings in the period such determination was made.\nAt December 30, 2017, we had approximately $54.5 million in deferred tax assets relating to tax credits and loss carryforwards, with a valuation allowance of $27.9 million, including $2.4 million in valuation allowances remaining in the Delta entities related to capital loss carryforwards, which are unlikely ever to be realized. If circumstances related to our deferred tax assets change in the future, we may be required to increase or decrease the valuation allowance on these assets, resulting in an increase or decrease in income tax expense and a reduction or increase in net income. For example, we recorded a full $9.9 million valuation allowance against a tax credit asset in fiscal 2016 as we determined it is not more likely than not these credits will be utilized before they expire.\nWe previously considered the earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, recorded no related deferred income tax liabilities. The 2017 Tax Act, enacted in December 2017, subjected our unremitted foreign earnings of approximately $400 million to tax at certain specified rates. We made a reasonable estimate of the Transition Tax and recorded a provisional transition tax obligation of $9.9 million. However, we are continuing to gather additional information to more precisely compute the amount of the transition tax. In addition, deferred taxes of $11.7 million related to these unremitted foreign earnings were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 for future taxes that will be incurred when cash is repatriated. This amount is provisional and our estimate and overall impact of the Act may change for various reasons including, but not limited to, changes in our interpretation and assumptions, additional guidance that may be issued by governing authorities, and tax planning actions we may undertake. We continue to gather additional information to fully account for the 2017 Tax Act and to determine our position with respect to future earnings. Any updates to our position will be communicated in future quarterly financial statements and may result in the recording of additional income tax expense.\nWe are subject to examination by taxing authorities in the various countries in which we operate. The tax years subject to examination vary by jurisdiction. We regularly consider the likelihood of additional income tax assessments in each of these taxing jurisdictions based on our experiences related to prior audits and our understanding of the facts and circumstances of the related tax issues. We include in current income tax expense any changes to accruals for potential tax deficiencies. If our judgments related to tax deficiencies differ from our actual experience, our income tax expense could increase or decrease in a given fiscal period.\nPension Benefits\nDelta Ltd. maintains a defined benefit pension plan for qualifying employees in the United Kingdom. There are no active employees as members in the plan. Independent actuaries assist in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with accounting for pension benefits to eligible employees. In order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses, we must make several assumptions. The critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets.\nWe evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually. Key assumptions are based on the following factors:\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Discount rate is based on the yields available on AA-rated corporate bonds with durational periods similar to that of the pension liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return, taking into consideration current and expected market conditions. Most of the assets in the pension plan are invested in corporate bonds, the expected return of which are estimated based on the yield available on AA rated corporate bonds. The long-term expected returns on equities are based on historic performance over the long-term.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Inflation is based on the estimated change in the consumer price index ( CPI\u201d) or the retail price index ( RPI\u201d), depending on the relevant plan provisions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We modified the method used to estimate the interest cost components of the net periodic pension expense in 2017. The new method uses the full yield curve approach to estimate the interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the present value of the benefit plan obligations to relevant projected cash outflows for the corresponding year. Prior to 2017, the interest cost components were determined using a single weighted-average discount rate. The change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit plan obligation at year-end as the change in interest cost will be offset by an equivalent but opposite change in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).\nThe discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation was 2.55% at December 30, 2017. The following tables present the key assumptions used to measure pension expense for 2018 and the estimated impact on 2018 pension expense relative to a change in those assumptions:\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions\n</td> <td>Pension\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>2.55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>4.29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inflation - CPI\n</td> <td>2.20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inflation - RPI\n</td> <td>3.15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions In Millions of Dollars\n</td> <td>Increase\nin Pension\nExpense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.25% decrease in discount rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.25% decrease in expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.25% increase in inflation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "summary": "The report provides an analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of a company for fiscal years 2017 and 2016.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nForward-Looking Statements\nManagement's discussion and analysis, and other sections of this annual report, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that management has made in light of experience in the industries in which the Company operates, as well as management's perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate under the circumstances. These statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company's control) and assumptions. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions. Many factors could affect the Company's actual financial results and cause them to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, among other things, risk factors described from time to time in the Company's reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as future economic and market circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results, operating efficiencies, availability and price of raw materials, availability and market acceptance of new products, product pricing, domestic and international competitive environments, and actions and policy changes of domestic and foreign governments.\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial position. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.\nGeneral\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFISCAL 2017 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2016\nOverview\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, our management and reporting structure changed to reflect management's expectations of future growth of certain product lines and to take into consideration the expected divestiture of the grinding media business, which historically was reported in the Energy and Mining segment. The access systems applications product line is now part of the Engineered Support Structures (\"ESS\") segment and the offshore and other complex structures product line is now part of the Utility segment. Grinding media will be reported in \"Other\" pending the completion of its divestiture. In the first quarter of 2017, we also changed our reportable segment operating income to separate out the LIFO expense (benefit). Certain inventories are accounted for using the LIFO method in the consolidated financial statements. Our segment discussions and segment financial information have been accordingly reclassified in this report to reflect this change, for all periods presented.\nOn a consolidated basis, the increase in net sales in 2017, as compared with 2016, reflected higher sales in all reportable segments. The changes in net sales in 2017, as compared with 2016, were as follows: \nVolume effects are estimated based on a physical production or sales measure. Since products we sell are not uniform in nature, pricing and mix relate to a combination of changes in sales prices and the attributes of the product sold. Accordingly, pricing and mix changes do not necessarily directly result in operating income changes.\nAverage steel index prices for both hot rolled coil and plate were higher in North America and China in 2017, as compared to 2016, resulting in higher average cost of material. We expect that average selling prices will increase over time to offset the decrease in gross profit realized from the higher cost of steel for the Company. The Company acquired a highway business in India (\"Aircon\") in the third quarter of 2017 that is included in the ESS segment.\nRestructuring Plan\nIn 2016, we executed a restructuring plan in Australia/New Zealand focused primarily on closing and consolidating locations within the ESS and Coatings segments (the \"2016 Plan\"). We incurred $7.8 million of restructuring expense consisting of $5.0 million in cost of goods sold and $2.8 million in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expense in 2016. The Plan was substantially completed in fiscal 2016.\nIn 2015, we executed a broad restructuring plan (the \"2015 Plan\") to respond to the market environment in certain of our businesses. During 2016, we incurred approximately $4.6 million of restructuring expense to complete the 2015 Plan consisting of $4.1 million in SG&A expense with the remainder recorded in cost of goods sold.\nCurrency Translation\nIn 2017, we realized a benefit to operating profit, as compared with fiscal 2016, due to currency translation effects. The U.S. dollar primarily weakened against the Brazilian real and South African rand, resulting in more operating profit in U.S. dollar terms. The breakdown of this effect by segment was as follows:\n\nGross Profit, SG&A, and Operating Income\nAt a consolidated level, the reduction in gross margin (gross profit as a percent of sales) in 2017, as compared with 2016, was primarily due to higher cost of raw materials across most of our businesses. The Utility segment realized an increase in gross margin in 2017, while ESS, Irrigation, and Coatings realized a decrease in gross profit primarily due to sales pricing that did not fully recover higher raw material costs and unfavorable sales mix. Lower volumes for Coatings and Other also contributed to the reduction in gross margin through deleverage of fixed costs.\nThe Company saw an increase within SG&A expense in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to the following:\n \u2022 higher employee incentives of $5.0 million due to improved business operations; \n \u2022 reversal of $3.2 million of a contingent consideration liability in 2016 to the former owners of an acquired business; \n \u2022 increased project and promotional expenses of $3.2 million, primarily in the irrigation segment; \n \u2022 higher deferred compensation expenses of $2.7 million, which was offset by a decrease of the same amount of other expense; and \n \u2022 currency translation effects of $1.9 million (higher SG&A) due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, and South African rand against the U.S. dollar. \nThe above increases were partially offset by the following decreases in SG&A expense in 2017 as compared to 2016:\n \u2022 restructuring expenses incurred in 2016 totaling $6.8 million; and \n \u2022 reversal of an environmental remediation liability of $2.6 million related to land of a former galvanizing operation in Australia that was sold in 2017. \nIn 2017, as compared to 2016, operating income for all operating segments were higher except for the ESS segment and Other. The increase in operating income in 2017, as compared to 2016, is primarily attributable to increased sales volumes in the Utility and Irrigation segments, along with restructuring expenses incurred in 2016 and the associated benefits of the restructuring activities.\nNet Interest Expense and Debt\nNet interest expense in 2017, as compared to 2016, was lower as interest income increased due to more cash on hand to invest. Long-term and short-term borrowings were consistent year-over-year.\nOther Income/Expense\nThe decrease in other income in 2017, as compared to 2016, is primarily due to the reversal of a contingent liability provision of approximately $16.6 million in 2016, out of \"Other noncurrent liabilities.\"\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective income tax rate in 2017 and 2016 was 46.5% and 19.1%, respectively. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"2017 Tax Act\" or Act\u201d) includes a number of changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code that impact corporations beginning in 2018; including a reduction in the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, limiting or eliminating certain tax deductions, and changing the taxation of unremitted foreign earnings. Accordingly, the Company recorded a one-time charge of approximately $42 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the transition effects of the Act. Excluding this charge, our effective tax rate would have been 28.1% for 2017. The $42 million charge is comprised of (a) approximately $9.9 million of expense related to the taxation of unremitted foreign earnings, the federal portion of which is payable over eight (8) years beginning in 2018, (b) approximately $20.4 million of expense related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax balances to reflect the new U.S. corporate income tax rate, using a federal and state tax rate of 25.0%, and (c) approximately $11.7 million of deferred expenses related to foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes.\nThese amounts are provisional and our estimates and overall impact of the Act may change for various reasons including, but not limited to, changes in our interpretation and assumptions, additional guidance that may be issued by governing authorities, and tax planning actions we may undertake. We continue to gather additional information to fully account for the Act. Any updates and changes in the estimates will be communicated in future quarterly financial statements.\nTax expense in 2016 included $30.6 million of deferred income tax benefit attributable to the remeasurement of the deferred tax asset related to the Company's U.K. defined benefit pension plan. In addition, we recorded a $9.9 million valuation allowance against a tax credit for which we believe we are not likely to receive the benefit in 2016. Excluding these items as well as the impact of the reversal of the contingent liability of $16.6 million that is not taxable, our adjusted effective tax rate was 30.8% for 2016 versus the GAAP reported effective tax rate of 19.1%.\nEarnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was higher in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to improved earnings for our majority-owned irrigation businesses.\nCash Flows from Operations\nOur cash flows provided by operations was $145.7 million in 2017, as compared with $219.2 million provided by operations in 2016. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to less favorable working capital changes driven by higher receivables and inventory and higher contributions to the Delta Pension Plan in 2017.\nEngineered Support Structures (ESS) segment\nThe increase in sales in 2017, as compared with 2016, was due to improved roadway product sales volumes and communication product line sales volumes. Global lighting and traffic, and roadway product sales in 2017 were higher compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016, primarily due to increased sales volumes in roadway product sales, which is a product line outside of North America. In 2017, as compared to 2016, sales volumes in the U.S. were lower across commercial and transportation markets. The 2015 long-term U.S. highway bill has not yet provided a meaningful uplift for our North America structures business. Sales in Europe were lower in 2017 as the domestic markets in general remain subdued. The increase in sales for global lighting and traffic, and roadway product is also attributed to currency translation effects and the acquisition of Aircon in the third quarter of 2017.\nCommunication product line sales were higher in 2017, as compared with 2016. In North America and Asia-Pacific, communication structure and component sales increased due to higher demand from the continued network expansion by providers.\nAccess systems product line net sales in 2017 were higher than in 2016, due to higher average sales prices and favorable currency translation effects.\nGross profit, as a percentage of sales, and operating income for the segment were lower in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to margin contraction from higher raw material costs that the business was not able to fully recover through higher sales pricing. SG&A spending was lower in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to lower commissions owed on communication product line sales, reduced incentives due to decreased operating performance, and restructuring costs and activities undertaken in 2016 to reduce the cost structure primarily in the access systems business in Australia.\nUtility Support Structures (Utility) segment\nIn the Utility segment, sales increased in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to improved volumes and higher sales prices due to steel cost increases and a favorable sales mix. A number of our sales contracts contain provisions that tie the sales price to published steel index pricing at the time our customer issues their purchase order. Improved sales demand in North America resulted in increased sales volumes in tons for both steel and concrete utility structures that also contributed to the increase in sales. International utility structures sales decreased in 2017 due to lower volumes.\nOffshore and other complex structures sales decreased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to lower volumes that were partially offset by favorable currency translation effects.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to improved pricing and sales mix and higher sales volumes in North America and improved factory performance for the offshore and other complex structures business. SG&A expense was higher in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to higher incentive expense due to improved\noperations and commission expense attributed to the increased sales volumes. Operating income increased in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to the increased sales volumes and improved pricing and sales mix in North America.\nCoatings segment\nCoatings segment sales increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to increased sales prices to recover higher zinc costs globally. External sales volumes decreased while intercompany volumes increased in North America during 2017. In the Asia-Pacific region, improved demand/volume in Australia along with currency transaction effects led to an increase in sales in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nSG&A expense was lower in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to lower compensation costs and no restructuring expense in 2017. Both 2017 and 2016 had non-recurring transactions recognized as reductions in SG&A. A former galvanizing operation in Australia was sold in 2017 allowing for a reversal of an environmental remediation liability of $2.6 million. In 2016, a contingent consideration liability to the former owners of an acquired business was reduced $3.2 million due to changes in estimated earnings over the earn-out period. Operating income was higher in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to lower SG&A expenses.\nIrrigation segment\nThe increase in Irrigation segment net sales in 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to sales volume increases for both domestic and international irrigation and currency translation effects. In North America, when comparing 2017 to 2016, sales volumes increased driven by markets outside the traditional corn-belt. In addition, higher equipment running times due to weather conditions resulted in higher service parts sales. International sales increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to volume increases in the Middle East and South America and favorable foreign currency translation effects for Brazil and South Africa.\nSG&A was higher in 2017, as compared with 2016. The increase can be attributed to higher incentive and commission costs due to improved business results, increased product development and promotional expenses, and currency translation effects related to the international irrigation business. Gross profit and operating income for the segment increased in 2017 over 2016, primarily due to North America and international irrigation sales volume increases and favorable foreign currency translation effects.\nOther\nGrinding media sales decreased from lower volumes. A decrease in sales volumes was partially offset by higher sales pricing and favorable currency translation effects. Gross profit and operating income were lower in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to lower volumes.\nLIFO expense\nSteel index prices for both hot rolled coil, plate, and zinc in the U.S. increased at a higher rate in 2017, as compared to 2016, which drove higher LIFO expense.\nNet corporate expense\nNet corporate expense is similar when comparing 2017 to 2016. Approximately $4 million of increased incentive expense was offset by lower pension expense and better performance of the Company's U.S. medical plan as compared to 2016.\nFISCAL 2016 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2015\nOverview\nThe Company's reported net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016 was impacted by a decrease in net sales ($97.2 million) and restructuring expenses (pre-tax $12.4 million). Reported net earnings for the year ended December 26, 2015 included restructuring expenses (pre-tax $39.9 million) and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets (pre-tax $42.0 million).\nOn a consolidated basis, the decrease in net sales in 2016, as compared with 2015, reflected lower sales in all reportable segments except for the ESS segment. In fiscal 2016, the Company had 53 weeks of operations while fiscal 2015 and 2014 had 52 weeks of operations. The estimated impact on the company's results of operations due to the extra week in fiscal 2016 was additional net sales of approximately $50 million and additional net earnings of approximately $3 million.\nThe changes in net sales in 2016, as compared with 2015, was due to the following factors:\n\nVolume effects are estimated based on a physical production or sales measure. Since products we sell are not uniform in nature, pricing and mix relate to a combination of changes in sales prices and the attributes of the product sold. Accordingly, pricing and mix changes do not necessarily directly result in operating income changes.\nRestructuring Plan\nIn 2016, we executed a restructuring plan in Australia/New Zealand focused primarily on closing and consolidating locations within the ESS and Coatings segments (the \"2016 Plan\"). We incurred approximately $7.8 million of restructuring expense consisting of $5.0 million in cost of goods sold and $2.8 million in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expense in 2016. The Plan was substantially completed in fiscal 2016.\nIn April 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a broad restructuring plan (the \"2015 Plan\") to respond to the market environment in certain of our businesses. During 2016, we incurred approximately $4.6 million of restructuring expense to complete the 2015 Plan consisting of $4.1 million in SG&A expense with the remainder recorded in cost of goods sold.\nInclusive of both the 2016 and 2015 Plans, operating income in 2016 was reduced due to restructuring expense by segment as follows:\n\nGoodwill and Trade Name Impairment\nThe Company recognized a $16.2 million impairment of goodwill on the APAC Coatings reporting unit during fiscal 2015, which represented all of the remaining goodwill on this reporting unit. The goodwill impairment was the result of difficulties in the Australian market over the last couple of years, including a general slowdown in manufacturing. In\naddition, the Company also recorded a $1.1 million impairment of the Industrial Galvanizing trade name (in the Coatings segment) and a $5.8 million impairment of the Webforge trade name (in the ESS segment) during 2015. The Company also recognized an $18.8 million goodwill impairment of its Access Systems reporting unit due to continued downward pressure on oil and natural gas prices which in turn reduces the prospects for new oil and gas exploration primarily in Australia and Southeast Asia.\nCurrency Translation\nIn 2016, we realized a decrease in operating profit of $1.6 million, as compared with 2015, due to currency translation effects. On average, the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies and in particular against the Australian dollar, Brazilian Real, Euro, and South African Rand, resulting in less operating profit in U.S. dollar terms. The breakdown of this effect by segment was as follows: \nGross Profit, SG&A, and Operating Income\nAt a consolidated level, the improvement in gross margin (gross profit as a percent of sales) in 2016, as compared with 2015, was due to restructuring activities undertaken in 2015 and the $17 million Utility segment commercial settlement recognized in 2015. Gross profit increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, for all operating segments except for Coatings and Irrigation. Gross profit decreased for Coatings and Irrigation primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable currency translation effects. Reduced average selling prices also resulted in a decline in gross profit for the Coatings segment.\nThe Company incurred $6.8 million of restructuring expense in 2016 within SG&A expense, compared to $18.2 million in 2015. Excluding restructuring expense, the Company saw a decrease in SG&A in 2016 of $65.2 million, as compared with 2015, mainly due to the following factors:\n \u2022 $42.0 million of goodwill and intangible impairments recorded in 2015 which did not recur in 2016; \n \u2022 reduced doubtful account provisions of $11.1 million, principally in the Irrigation segment; \n \u2022 currency translation effects of $4.7 million (lower SG&A) due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar primarily against the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, and South African rand; \n \u2022 reversal of $3.2 million of a contingent consideration liability to the former owners of Pure Metal Galvanizing in 2016; and \n \u2022 reductions due to exiting a business development activity, lower project expenses, reduced discretionary spending, and benefits from restructuring activities undertaken in 2015. \nThe above reductions were partially offset by the following increases in SG&A expense in 2016 as compared with 2015:\n \u2022 increased incentive expenses due to improved operating performance of $13.6 million; \n \u2022 higher deferred compensation expenses of $1.5 million, which was offset by a decrease of the same amount of other expense; and \n \u2022 increased pension expenses of $2.5 million. \nIn 2016 as compared to 2015, operating income improved for all operating segments. The increase in operating income is primarily attributable to reduced expenses for restructuring activities and the associated benefits of the restructuring activities, no goodwill or intangible asset impairments in 2016, lower doubtful account provisions, and reduced overall SG&A spending.\nNet Interest Expense and Debt\nNet interest expense in 2016, as compared to 2015, was consistent due to minimal changes in short and long-term borrowings.\nOther Expense\nThe increase in other income in 2016 is a result of the reversal of a contingent liability provision, approximately $16.6 million, out of \"Other noncurrent liabilities.\" This liability was originally recorded as part of the Delta purchase accounting in 2010 to address a certain contingent liability. The statutes of limitation have expired and we now determine this matter to be remote.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective income tax rates were 19.1% and 51.0% in 2016 and 2015. Fiscal 2016 includes $30.6 million of deferred income tax benefit attributable to the re-measurement of the deferred tax asset related to the Company's U.K. defined benefit pension plan. In addition, in fiscal 2016 we recorded a $9.9 million valuation allowance against a tax credit for which we believe we are not likely to receive the benefit.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nForward-Looking Statements\nManagement's discussion and analysis, and other sections of this annual report, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that management has made in light of experience in the industries in which the Company operates, as well as management's perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate under the circumstances. These statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company's control) and assumptions. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions. Many factors could affect the Company's actual financial results and cause them to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, among other things, risk factors described from time to time in the Company's reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as future economic and market circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results, operating efficiencies, availability and price of raw materials, availability and market acceptance of new products, product pricing, domestic and international competitive environments, and actions and policy changes of domestic and foreign governments.\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial position.

</tr>\n</table>\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFISCAL 2017 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2016\nOverview\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, our management and reporting structure changed to reflect management's expectations of future growth of certain product lines and to take into consideration the expected divestiture of the grinding media business, which historically was reported in the Energy and Mining segment. The access systems applications product line is now part of the Engineered Support Structures (\"ESS\") segment and the offshore and other complex structures product line is now part of the Utility segment. Grinding media will be reported in \"Other\" pending the completion of its divestiture. In the first quarter of 2017, we also changed our reportable segment operating income to separate out the LIFO expense (benefit). Certain inventories are accounted for using the LIFO method in the consolidated financial statements. Our segment discussions and segment financial information have been accordingly reclassified in this report to reflect this change, for all periods presented.\nOn a consolidated basis, the increase in net sales in 2017, as compared with 2016, reflected higher sales in all reportable segments. The changes in net sales in 2017, as compared with 2016, were as follows: Table 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>ESS\n</td> <td>Utility\n</td> <td>Coatings\n</td> <td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales - 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,521.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>891.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>735.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>568.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume\n</td> <td>97.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>61.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pricing/mix\n</td> <td>102.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Currency translation\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales - 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,746.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>912.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>856.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>256.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>644.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nVolume effects are estimated based on a physical production or sales measure. Since products we sell are not uniform in nature, pricing and mix relate to a combination of changes in sales prices and the attributes of the product sold. Accordingly, pricing and mix changes do not necessarily directly result in operating income changes.\nAverage steel index prices for both hot rolled coil and plate were higher in North America and China in 2017, as compared to 2016, resulting in higher average cost of material. We expect that average selling prices will increase over time to offset the decrease in gross profit realized from the higher cost of steel for the Company. The Company acquired a highway business in India (\"Aircon\") in the third quarter of 2017 that is included in the ESS segment.\nRestructuring Plan\nIn 2016, we executed a restructuring plan in Australia/New Zealand focused primarily on closing and consolidating locations within the ESS and Coatings segments (the \"2016 Plan\"). We incurred $7.8 million of restructuring expense consisting of $5.0 million in cost of goods sold and $2.8 million in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expense in 2016. The Plan was substantially completed in fiscal 2016.\nIn 2015, we executed a broad restructuring plan (the \"2015 Plan\") to respond to the market environment in certain of our businesses. During 2016, we incurred approximately $4.6 million of restructuring expense to complete the 2015 Plan consisting of $4.1 million in SG&A expense with the remainder recorded in cost of goods sold.\nCurrency Translation\nIn 2017, we realized a benefit to operating profit, as compared with fiscal 2016, due to currency translation effects. The U.S. dollar primarily weakened against the Brazilian real and South African rand, resulting in more operating profit in U.S. dollar terms. The breakdown of this effect by segment was as follows:\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>ESS\n</td> <td>Utility\n</td> <td>Coatings\n</td> <td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>Corporate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit, SG&A, and Operating Income\nAt a consolidated level, the reduction in gross margin (gross profit as a percent of sales) in 2017, as compared with 2016, was primarily due to higher cost of raw materials across most of our businesses. The Utility segment realized an increase in gross margin in 2017, while ESS, Irrigation, and Coatings realized a decrease in gross profit primarily due to sales pricing that did not fully recover higher raw material costs and unfavorable sales mix. Lower volumes for Coatings and Other also contributed to the reduction in gross margin through deleverage of fixed costs.\nThe Company saw an increase within SG&A expense in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to the following:\n \u2022 higher employee incentives of $5.0 million due to improved business operations; \n \u2022 reversal of $3.2 million of a contingent consideration liability in 2016 to the former owners of an acquired business; \n \u2022 increased project and promotional expenses of $3.2 million, primarily in the irrigation segment; \n \u2022 higher deferred compensation expenses of $2.7 million, which was offset by a decrease of the same amount of other expense; and \n \u2022 currency translation effects of $1.9 million (higher SG&A) due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, and South African rand against the U.S. dollar. \nThe above increases were partially offset by the following decreases in SG&A expense in 2017 as compared to 2016:\n \u2022 restructuring expenses incurred in 2016 totaling $6.8 million; and \n \u2022 reversal of an environmental remediation liability of $2.6 million related to land of a former galvanizing operation in Australia that was sold in 2017. \nIn 2017, as compared to 2016, operating income for all operating segments were higher except for the ESS segment and Other. The increase in operating income in 2017, as compared to 2016, is primarily attributable to increased sales volumes in the Utility and Irrigation segments, along with restructuring expenses incurred in 2016 and the associated benefits of the restructuring activities.\nNet Interest Expense and Debt\nNet interest expense in 2017, as compared to 2016, was lower as interest income increased due to more cash on hand to invest. Long-term and short-term borrowings were consistent year-over-year.\nOther Income/Expense\nThe decrease in other income in 2017, as compared to 2016, is primarily due to the reversal of a contingent liability provision of approximately $16.6 million in 2016, out of \"Other noncurrent liabilities.\"\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective income tax rate in 2017 and 2016 was 46.5% and 19.1%, respectively. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"2017 Tax Act\" or Act\u201d) includes a number of changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code that impact corporations beginning in 2018; including a reduction in the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, limiting or eliminating certain tax deductions, and changing the taxation of unremitted foreign earnings. Accordingly, the Company recorded a one-time charge of approximately $42 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the transition effects of the Act. Excluding this charge, our effective tax rate would have been 28.1% for 2017. The $42 million charge is comprised of (a) approximately $9.9 million of expense related to the taxation of unremitted foreign earnings, the federal portion of which is payable over eight (8) years beginning in 2018, (b) approximately $20.4 million of expense related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax balances to reflect the new U.S. corporate income tax rate, using a federal and state tax rate of 25.0%, and (c) approximately $11.7 million of deferred expenses related to foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes.\nThese amounts are provisional and our estimates and overall impact of the Act may change for various reasons including, but not limited to, changes in our interpretation and assumptions, additional guidance that may be issued by governing authorities, and tax planning actions we may undertake. We continue to gather additional information to fully account for the Act. Any updates and changes in the estimates will be communicated in future quarterly financial statements.\nTax expense in 2016 included $30.6 million of deferred income tax benefit attributable to the remeasurement of the deferred tax asset related to the Company's U.K. defined benefit pension plan. In addition, we recorded a $9.9 million valuation allowance against a tax credit for which we believe we are not likely to receive the benefit in 2016. Excluding these items as well as the impact of the reversal of the contingent liability of $16.6 million that is not taxable, our adjusted effective tax rate was 30.8% for 2016 versus the GAAP reported effective tax rate of 19.1%.\nEarnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was higher in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to improved earnings for our majority-owned irrigation businesses.\nCash Flows from Operations\nOur cash flows provided by operations was $145.7 million in 2017, as compared with $219.2 million provided by operations in 2016. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to less favorable working capital changes driven by higher receivables and inventory and higher contributions to the Delta Pension Plan in 2017.\nEngineered Support Structures (ESS) segment\nThe increase in sales in 2017, as compared with 2016, was due to improved roadway product sales volumes and communication product line sales volumes. Global lighting and traffic, and roadway product sales in 2017 were higher compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016, primarily due to increased sales volumes in roadway product sales, which is a product line outside of North America. In 2017, as compared to 2016, sales volumes in the U.S. were lower across commercial and transportation markets. The 2015 long-term U.S. highway bill has not yet provided a meaningful uplift for our North America structures business. Sales in Europe were lower in 2017 as the domestic markets in general remain subdued. The increase in sales for global lighting and traffic, and roadway product is also attributed to currency translation effects and the acquisition of Aircon in the third quarter of 2017.\nCommunication product line sales were higher in 2017, as compared with 2016. In North America and Asia-Pacific, communication structure and component sales increased due to higher demand from the continued network expansion by providers.\nAccess systems product line net sales in 2017 were higher than in 2016, due to higher average sales prices and favorable currency translation effects.\nGross profit, as a percentage of sales, and operating income for the segment were lower in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to margin contraction from higher raw material costs that the business was not able to fully recover through higher sales pricing. SG&A spending was lower in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to lower commissions owed on communication product line sales, reduced incentives due to decreased operating performance, and restructuring costs and activities undertaken in 2016 to reduce the cost structure primarily in the access systems business in Australia.\nUtility Support Structures (Utility) segment\nIn the Utility segment, sales increased in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to improved volumes and higher sales prices due to steel cost increases and a favorable sales mix. A number of our sales contracts contain provisions that tie the sales price to published steel index pricing at the time our customer issues their purchase order. Improved sales demand in North America resulted in increased sales volumes in tons for both steel and concrete utility structures that also contributed to the increase in sales. International utility structures sales decreased in 2017 due to lower volumes.\nOffshore and other complex structures sales decreased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to lower volumes that were partially offset by favorable currency translation effects.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to improved pricing and sales mix and higher sales volumes in North America and improved factory performance for the offshore and other complex structures business. SG&A expense was higher in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to higher incentive expense due to improved\noperations and commission expense attributed to the increased sales volumes. Operating income increased in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to the increased sales volumes and improved pricing and sales mix in North America.\nCoatings segment\nCoatings segment sales increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to increased sales prices to recover higher zinc costs globally. External sales volumes decreased while intercompany volumes increased in North America during 2017. In the Asia-Pacific region, improved demand/volume in Australia along with currency transaction effects led to an increase in sales in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nSG&A expense was lower in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to lower compensation costs and no restructuring expense in 2017. Both 2017 and 2016 had non-recurring transactions recognized as reductions in SG&A. A former galvanizing operation in Australia was sold in 2017 allowing for a reversal of an environmental remediation liability of $2.6 million. In 2016, a contingent consideration liability to the former owners of an acquired business was reduced $3.2 million due to changes in estimated earnings over the earn-out period. Operating income was higher in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to lower SG&A expenses.\nIrrigation segment\nThe increase in Irrigation segment net sales in 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to sales volume increases for both domestic and international irrigation and currency translation effects. In North America, when comparing 2017 to 2016, sales volumes increased driven by markets outside the traditional corn-belt. In addition, higher equipment running times due to weather conditions resulted in higher service parts sales. International sales increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to volume increases in the Middle East and South America and favorable foreign currency translation effects for Brazil and South Africa.\nSG&A was higher in 2017, as compared with 2016. The increase can be attributed to higher incentive and commission costs due to improved business results, increased product development and promotional expenses, and currency translation effects related to the international irrigation business. Gross profit and operating income for the segment increased in 2017 over 2016, primarily due to North America and international irrigation sales volume increases and favorable foreign currency translation effects.\nOther\nGrinding media sales decreased from lower volumes. A decrease in sales volumes was partially offset by higher sales pricing and favorable currency translation effects. Gross profit and operating income were lower in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to lower volumes.\nLIFO expense\nSteel index prices for both hot rolled coil, plate, and zinc in the U.S. increased at a higher rate in 2017, as compared to 2016, which drove higher LIFO expense.\nNet corporate expense\nNet corporate expense is similar when comparing 2017 to 2016. Approximately $4 million of increased incentive expense was offset by lower pension expense and better performance of the Company's U.S. medical plan as compared to 2016.\nFISCAL 2016 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2015\nOverview\nThe Company's reported net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016 was impacted by a decrease in net sales ($97.2 million) and restructuring expenses (pre-tax $12.4 million). Reported net earnings for the year ended December 26, 2015 included restructuring expenses (pre-tax $39.9 million) and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets (pre-tax $42.0 million).\nOn a consolidated basis, the decrease in net sales in 2016, as compared with 2015, reflected lower sales in all reportable segments except for the ESS segment. In fiscal 2016, the Company had 53 weeks of operations while fiscal 2015 and 2014 had 52 weeks of operations. The estimated impact on the company's results of operations due to the extra week in fiscal 2016 was additional net sales of approximately $50 million and additional net earnings of approximately $3 million.\nThe changes in net sales in 2016, as compared with 2015, was due to the following factors:\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>ESS\n</td> <td>Utility\n</td> <td>Coatings\n</td> <td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales - 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,618.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>880.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>777.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>255.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>605.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume\n</td> <td>(13.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>38.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(29.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(14.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pricing/mix\n</td> <td>(60.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(13.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(44.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Currency translation\n</td> <td>(29.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(14.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(9.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales - 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,521.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>891.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>735.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>568.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nVolume effects are estimated based on a physical production or sales measure. Since products we sell are not uniform in nature, pricing and mix relate to a combination of changes in sales prices and the attributes of the product sold. Accordingly, pricing and mix changes do not necessarily directly result in operating income changes.\nRestructuring Plan\nIn 2016, we executed a restructuring plan in Australia/New Zealand focused primarily on closing and consolidating locations within the ESS and Coatings segments (the \"2016 Plan\"). We incurred approximately $7.8 million of restructuring expense consisting of $5.0 million in cost of goods sold and $2.8 million in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expense in 2016. The Plan was substantially completed in fiscal 2016.\nIn April 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a broad restructuring plan (the \"2015 Plan\") to respond to the market environment in certain of our businesses. During 2016, we incurred approximately $4.6 million of restructuring expense to complete the 2015 Plan consisting of $4.1 million in SG&A expense with the remainder recorded in cost of goods sold.\nInclusive of both the 2016 and 2015 Plans, operating income in 2016 was reduced due to restructuring expense by segment as follows:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>ESS\n</td> <td>Utility\n</td> <td>Coatings\n</td> <td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>Corporate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill and Trade Name Impairment\nThe Company recognized a $16.2 million impairment of goodwill on the APAC Coatings reporting unit during fiscal 2015, which represented all of the remaining goodwill on this reporting unit. The goodwill impairment was the result of difficulties in the Australian market over the last couple of years, including a general slowdown in manufacturing. In\naddition, the Company also recorded a $1.1 million impairment of the Industrial Galvanizing trade name (in the Coatings segment) and a $5.8 million impairment of the Webforge trade name (in the ESS segment) during 2015. The Company also recognized an $18.8 million goodwill impairment of its Access Systems reporting unit due to continued downward pressure on oil and natural gas prices which in turn reduces the prospects for new oil and gas exploration primarily in Australia and Southeast Asia.\nCurrency Translation\nIn 2016, we realized a decrease in operating profit of $1.6 million, as compared with 2015, due to currency translation effects. On average, the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies and in particular against the Australian dollar, Brazilian Real, Euro, and South African Rand, resulting in less operating profit in U.S. dollar terms. The breakdown of this effect by segment was as follows: Table 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>ESS\n</td> <td>Utility\n</td> <td>Coatings\n</td> <td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>Corporate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit, SG&A, and Operating Income\nAt a consolidated level, the improvement in gross margin (gross profit as a percent of sales) in 2016, as compared with 2015, was due to restructuring activities undertaken in 2015 and the $17 million Utility segment commercial settlement recognized in 2015. Gross profit increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, for all operating segments except for Coatings and Irrigation. Gross profit decreased for Coatings and Irrigation primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable currency translation effects. Reduced average selling prices also resulted in a decline in gross profit for the Coatings segment.\nThe Company incurred $6.8 million of restructuring expense in 2016 within SG&A expense, compared to $18.2 million in 2015. Excluding restructuring expense, the Company saw a decrease in SG&A in 2016 of $65.2 million, as compared with 2015, mainly due to the following factors:\n \u2022 $42.0 million of goodwill and intangible impairments recorded in 2015 which did not recur in 2016; \n \u2022 reduced doubtful account provisions of $11.1 million, principally in the Irrigation segment; \n \u2022 currency translation effects of $4.7 million (lower SG&A) due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar primarily against the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, and South African rand; \n \u2022 reversal of $3.2 million of a contingent consideration liability to the former owners of Pure Metal Galvanizing in 2016; and \n \u2022 reductions due to exiting a business development activity, lower project expenses, reduced discretionary spending, and benefits from restructuring activities undertaken in 2015. \nThe above reductions were partially offset by the following increases in SG&A expense in 2016 as compared with 2015:\n \u2022 increased incentive expenses due to improved operating performance of $13.6 million; \n \u2022 higher deferred compensation expenses of $1.5 million, which was offset by a decrease of the same amount of other expense; and \n \u2022 increased pension expenses of $2.5 million. \nIn 2016 as compared to 2015, operating income improved for all operating segments. The increase in operating income is primarily attributable to reduced expenses for restructuring activities and the associated benefits of the restructuring activities, no goodwill or intangible asset impairments in 2016, lower doubtful account provisions, and reduced overall SG&A spending.\nNet Interest Expense and Debt\nNet interest expense in 2016, as compared to 2015, was consistent due to minimal changes in short and long-term borrowings.\nOther Expense\nThe increase in other income in 2016 is a result of the reversal of a contingent liability provision, approximately $16.6 million, out of \"Other noncurrent liabilities.\" This liability was originally recorded as part of the Delta purchase accounting in 2010 to address a certain contingent liability. The statutes of limitation have expired and we now determine this matter to be remote.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective income tax rates were 19.1% and 51.0% in 2016 and 2015. Fiscal 2016 includes $30.6 million of deferred income tax benefit attributable to the re-measurement of the deferred tax asset related to the Company's U.K. defined benefit pension plan. In addition, in fiscal 2016 we recorded a $9.9 million valuation allowance against a tax credit for which we believe we are not likely to receive the benefit. Excluding these items as well as the"}
