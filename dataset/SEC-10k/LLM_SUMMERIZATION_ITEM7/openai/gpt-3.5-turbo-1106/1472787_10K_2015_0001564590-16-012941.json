The Company is presenting these non-GAAP financial measures because they provide the Company's management and readers of this Annual Report on Form 10-K with additional insight into the operational performance of the Company relative to earlier periods. The Company does not intend for these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for any GAAP financial information. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, these non-GAAP financial measures have been presented with, and reconciled to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Readers of this Annual Report on Form 10-K should use these non-GAAP financial measures only in conjunction with the comparable GAAP financial measures.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and reflect the consolidated operations of the Company. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of First American Financial Corporation and all controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Investments in affiliates in which the Company exercises significant influence, but does not control and is not the primary beneficiary, are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in affiliates in which the Company does not exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for under the cost method.\nReportable Segments\nThe Company consists of the following reportable segments and a corporate function:\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The Company's title insurance and services segment issues title insurance policies on residential and commercial property in the United States and offers similar or related products and services internationally. This segment also provides closing and/or escrow services; accommodates tax-deferred exchanges of real estate; provides products, services and solutions involving the use of real property related data designed to mitigate risk or otherwise facilitate real estate transactions; maintains, manages and provides access to title plant records and images; and provides banking, trust and investment advisory services. The Company, through its principal title insurance subsidiary and such subsidiary's affiliates, transacts its title insurance business through a network of direct operations and agents. Through this network, the Company issues policies in the 49 states that permit the issuance of title insurance policies and the District of Columbia. The Company also offers title insurance and other insurance and guarantee products, as well as related settlement services in foreign countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and various other established and emerging markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The Company's specialty insurance segment issues property and casualty insurance policies and sells home warranty products.

This business is licensed to issue policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and actively issues policies in 46 states. In certain markets it also offers preferred risk auto insurance to better compete with other carriers offering bundled home and auto insurance. The home warranty business provides residential service contracts that cover residential systems, such as heating and air conditioning systems, and appliances against failures that occur as the result of normal usage during the coverage period. This business currently operates in 39 states and the District of Columbia.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe corporate function consists primarily of certain financing facilities as well as the corporate services that support the Company's business operations.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. The Company's management considers the accounting policies described below to be the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions in preparing the Company's consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 Description of the Company to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the Company's significant accounting policies.\nProvision for policy losses. The Company provides for title insurance losses by a charge to expense when the related premium revenue is recognized. The amount charged to expense is generally determined by applying a rate (the loss provision rate) to total title insurance premiums and escrow fees. The Company's management estimates the loss provision rate at the beginning of each year and reassesses the rate quarterly to ensure that the resulting incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) loss reserve and known claims reserve included in the Company's consolidated balance sheets together reflect management's best estimate of the total costs required to settle all IBNR and known claims. If the ending IBNR reserve is not considered adequate, an adjustment is recorded.\nThe process of assessing the loss provision rate and the resulting IBNR reserve involves evaluation of the results of an in-house actuarial review. The Company's in-house actuary performs a reserve analysis utilizing generally accepted actuarial methods that incorporate cumulative historical claims experience and information provided by in-house claims and operations personnel. Current economic and business trends are also reviewed and used in the reserve analysis. These include conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, changes in residential and commercial real estate values, and changes in the levels of defaults and foreclosures that may affect claims levels and patterns of emergence, as well as any company-specific factors that may be relevant to past and future claims experience. Results from the analysis include, but are not limited to, a range of IBNR reserve estimates and a single point estimate for IBNR as of the balance sheet date.\nFor recent policy years at early stages of development (generally the last three years), IBNR is estimated using a combination of expected loss rate and multiplicative loss development factor calculations. For more mature policy years, IBNR generally is estimated using multiplicative loss development factor calculations. The expected loss rate method estimates IBNR by applying an expected loss rate to total title insurance premiums and escrow fees, and adjusting for policy year maturity using estimated loss development patterns. Multiplicative loss development factor calculations estimate IBNR by applying factors derived from loss development patterns to losses realized to date. The expected loss rate and loss development patterns are based on historical experience and the relationship of the history to the applicable policy years.\nThe Company's management uses the IBNR point estimate from the in-house actuary's analysis and other relevant information it may have concerning claims to determine what it considers to be the best estimate of the total amount required for the IBNR reserve.\nThe volume and timing of title insurance claims are subject to cyclical influences from real estate and mortgage markets. Title policies issued to lenders constitute a large portion of the Company's title insurance volume. These policies insure lenders against losses on mortgage loans due to title defects in the collateral property. Even if an underlying title defect exists that could result in a claim, often, the lender must realize an actual loss, or at least be likely to realize an actual loss, for title insurance liability to exist. As a result, title insurance claims exposure is sensitive to lenders' losses on mortgage loans, and is affected in turn by external factors that affect mortgage loan losses, particularly macroeconomic factors.\nA general decline in real estate prices can expose lenders to greater risk of losses on mortgage loans, as loan-to-value ratios increase and defaults and foreclosures increase. Title insurance claims exposure for a given policy year is also affected by the quality of mortgage loan underwriting during the corresponding origination year. The Company believes that sensitivity of claims to external conditions in real estate and mortgage markets is an inherent feature of title insurance's business economics that applies broadly to the title insurance industry.\nTitle insurance policies are long-duration contracts with the majority of the claims reported to the Company within the first few years following the issuance of the policy. Generally, 70% to 80% of claim amounts become known in the first six years of the policy life, and the majority of IBNR reserves relate to the six most recent policy years. Changes in expected ultimate losses and corresponding loss rates for recent policy years are considered likely and could result in a material adjustment to the IBNR reserves. Based on historical experience, management believes a 50 basis point change to the loss rates for the most recent policy years, positive or negative, is reasonably likely given the long duration nature of a title insurance policy. For example, if the expected ultimate losses for each of the last six policy years increased or decreased by 50 basis points, the resulting impact on the Company's IBNR reserve would be an increase or decrease, as the case may be, of $103.2 million. A material change in expected ultimate losses and corresponding loss rates for older policy years is also possible, particularly for policy years with loss ratios exceeding historical norms. The estimates made by management in determining the appropriate level of IBNR reserves could ultimately prove to be materially different from actual claims experience.\nThe Company provides for property and casualty insurance losses when the insured event occurs. The Company provides for claims losses relating to its home warranty business based on the average cost per claim as applied to the total of new claims incurred. The average cost per home warranty claim is calculated using the average of the most recent 12 months of claims experience adjusted for estimated future increases in costs.\nA summary of the Company's loss reserves is as follows:\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

reinsured losses related to a large commercial title claim.\nThe provision transferred from IBNR title claims related to current year decreased by $16.4 million in 2015 from 2014 and increased by $12.2 million in 2014 from 2013 and payments, net of recoveries, related to current year decreased by $11.0 million in 2015 from 2014 and increased by $6.9 million in 2014 from 2013, reflecting variability in claims volumes characteristic of a policy year during its first year of development. In addition, 2014 experienced a higher level of fraud losses when compared to 2015 and 2013.\nThe provision transferred from IBNR title claims related to prior years decreased by $90.0 million, or 32.8%, in 2015 from 2014 and decreased $5.9 million, or 2.1%, in 2014 from 2013. Payments, net of recoveries, related to prior years decreased by $6.3 million, or 2.5%, in 2015 from 2014 and decreased $30.8 million, or 11.0%, in 2014 from 2013. Generally, the provision transferred from IBNR title claims and payments are expected to decline with the runoff of older policy years that have higher expected ultimate losses, particularly policy years 2005 through 2008. This trend was partially impacted by the timing of the provision transferred from IBNR title claims and payments associated with certain large claims. During 2014, the Company transferred provision of $56.0 million from IBNR title claims related to these large claims, and the Company paid $35.0 million, net of $21.0 million recovered through reinsurance, during the first quarter of 2015 to settle these claims.\nActivity in the reserve for incurred but not reported title claims is summarized as follows:\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at beginning of year\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 802,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 840,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 805,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision related to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 170,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 188,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 194,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prior years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 93,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 150,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 263,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 253,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 344,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision transferred to known title claims related to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prior years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 184,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 274,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 280,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 198,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 304,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 298,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23,544\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,962\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at end of year\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 844,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 802,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 840,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther\u201d primarily included foreign currency translation gains and losses, assets acquired in connection with claim settlements, and recoveries.

This decrease was attributable to a lower current year loss rate in 2015 when compared to 2014, partly offset by a 13.0% increase in title premiums and escrow fees in 2015 from 2014. The current year loss rate in 2015 was 4.2% compared to 5.3% in 2014.\nThe provision related to current year decreased by $5.5 million, or 2.8%, in 2014 from 2013. This decrease was attributable to a 7.7% decline in title premiums and escrow fees in 2014 from 2013, partly offset by a higher current year loss rate in 2014 when compared to 2013. The current year loss rate in 2014 was 5.3% compared to 5.0% in 2013.\nFor further discussion of title provision recorded in 2015, 2014 and 2013, see Results of Operations, pages 36 and 37.\nFair value of investment portfolio. The Company categorizes the fair value of its debt and equity securities using a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements that distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company (observable inputs) and the Company's own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy for inputs used in determining fair value maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy level assigned to each security in the Company's available-for-sale portfolio was based on management's assessment of the transparency and reliability of the inputs used to estimate the fair values at the measurement date. See Note 14 Fair Value Measurements to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the three-level hierarchy and a description for each level.\nThe valuation techniques and inputs used to estimate the fair value of the Company's debt and equity securities are summarized as follows:\nFair value of debt securities\nThe fair values of debt securities were based on the market values obtained from independent pricing services that were evaluated using pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information and price quotes from well-established independent broker-dealers. The independent pricing services monitor market indicators, industry and economic events, and for broker-quoted only securities, obtain quotes from market makers or broker-dealers that they recognize to be market participants. The pricing services utilize the market approach in determining the fair value of the debt securities held by the Company. The Company obtains an understanding of the valuation models and assumptions utilized by the services and has controls in place to determine that the values provided represent fair value. The Company's validation procedures include comparing prices received from the pricing services to quotes received from other third party sources for certain securities with market prices that are readily verifiable. If the price comparison results in differences over a predefined threshold, the Company will assess the reasonableness of the changes relative to prior periods given the prevailing market conditions and assess changes in the issuers' credit worthiness, performance of any underlying collateral and prices of the instrument relative to similar issuances. To date, the Company has not made any material adjustments to the fair value measurements provided by the pricing services.\nTypical inputs and assumptions to pricing models used to value the Company's U.S. Treasury bonds, municipal bonds, foreign government bonds, governmental agency bonds, governmental agency mortgage-backed securities, U.S. and foreign corporate debt securities include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, credit spreads, credit ratings, bond insurance (if applicable), benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data and industry and economic events. For mortgage-backed securities, inputs and assumptions may also include the structure of issuance, characteristics of the issuer, collateral attributes and prepayment speeds. Non-agency mortgage-backed securities and certain U.S. and foreign corporate debt securities were not actively traded and there were fewer observable inputs available requiring the use of more judgment in determining their fair values, which resulted in their classification as Level 3.\nOther-than-temporary impairment-debt securities\nIf the Company intends to sell a debt security in an unrealized loss position or determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell a debt security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the debt security is other-than-temporarily impaired and it is written down to fair value with all losses recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2015, the Company did not intend to sell any debt securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis.\nIf the Company does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of a debt security with declines in fair value (even if the Company does not intend to sell the debt security and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security), the losses the Company considers to be the credit portion of the other-than-temporary impairment loss ( credit loss\u201d) is recognized in earnings and the non-credit portion is recognized in other comprehensive income. The credit loss is the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security. The cash flows expected to be collected are discounted at the rate implicit in the security immediately prior to the recognition of the other-than-temporary impairment.\nExpected future cash flows for debt securities are based on qualitative and quantitative factors specific to each security, including the probability of default and the estimated timing and amount of recovery. The detailed inputs used to project expected future cash flows may be different depending on the nature of the individual debt security.\nThe Company recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses considered to be credit related on its debt securities of $2.2 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment losses related to its debt securities for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nFair value of equity securities\nThe fair values of equity securities, including preferred and common stocks, were based on quoted market prices for identical assets that are readily and regularly available in an active market.\nOther-than-temporary impairment-equity securities\nWhen a decline in the fair value of an equity security, including common and preferred stock, is considered to be other-than-temporary, such equity security is written down to its fair value. When assessing if a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the factors considered include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost, the probability that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the security, the seniority of the securities, issuer-specific news and other developments, the financial condition and prospects of the issuer (including credit ratings), macro-economic changes (including the outlook for industry sectors, which includes government policy initiatives) and the Company's ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery.\nWhen an equity security has been in an unrealized loss position and its fair value is less than 80% of cost for twelve consecutive months, the Company's review of the security includes the above noted factors as well as other evidence that might exist supporting the view that the security will recover its value in the foreseeable future, typically within the next twelve months. If objective, substantial evidence does not indicate a likely recovery during that timeframe, the Company's policy is that such losses are considered other-than-temporary and therefore an impairment loss is recorded. The Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment losses related to its equity securities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nLitigation and regulatory contingencies. The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of ongoing routine and non-ordinary course legal proceedings. For those lawsuits where the Company has determined that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, a liability representing the best estimate of the Company's financial exposure based on known facts has been recorded. Actual losses may materially differ from the amounts recorded. For a substantial majority of these lawsuits it is not possible to assess the probability of loss. Most of these lawsuits are putative class actions which require a plaintiff to satisfy a number of procedural requirements before proceeding to trial. As a result of, among other factors, ambiguities and inconsistencies in the myriad laws applicable to the Company's business and the uniqueness of the factual issues presented in any given lawsuit, the Company often cannot determine the probability of loss until a court has finally determined that a plaintiff has satisfied applicable procedural requirements. Furthermore, because most of these lawsuits are putative class actions, it is often impossible to estimate the possible loss or a range of loss amounts, even where the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible. In addition, many of the Company's businesses are regulated by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies and are subject to numerous statutory guidelines. These regulations and statutory guidelines often are complex, inconsistent or ambiguous, which results in additional uncertainty as to the outcome of a given lawsuit-including the amount of damages a plaintiff might be afforded-or makes it difficult to analogize experience in one case or jurisdiction to another case or jurisdiction.\nBusiness Combinations. The Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nCritical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, useful lives and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, may differ from actual results. Other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nImpairment assessment for goodwill. The Company is required to perform an annual goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit. The Company's four reporting units are title insurance, home warranty, property and casualty insurance and trust and other services. The Company has elected to perform this annual assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or sooner if circumstances indicate possible impairment. Based on current guidance, the Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of greater than 50%) less than the carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test, or may choose to forego the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative impairment test. The qualitative factors considered in this assessment may include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance as well as other relevant events and circumstances as determined by the Company. The Company evaluates the weight of each factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that impairment may exist. If the results of the qualitative assessment indicate the more likely than not threshold was not met, the Company may choose not to perform the quantitative impairment test. If, however, the more likely than not threshold is met, the Company performs the quantitative test as required and discussed below.\nManagement's quantitative impairment testing process includes two steps. The first step ( Step 1\u201d) compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. The fair value of each reporting unit is determined by using discounted cash flow analysis and market approach valuations. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill is not considered impaired and no additional analysis is required. However, if the carrying amount is greater than the fair value, a second step ( Step 2\u201d) must be completed to determine if the fair value of the goodwill exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill.\nStep 2 involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which Step 1 indicated impairment. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in Step 1, over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess. An impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit, and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill. Subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted.\nThe quantitative impairment test for goodwill utilizes a variety of valuation techniques, all of which require the Company to make estimates and judgments. Fair value is determined by employing an expected present value technique, which utilizes multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and an appropriate discount rate. The use of comparative market multiples (the market approach\u201d) compares the reporting unit to other comparable companies (if such comparables are present in the marketplace) based on valuation multiples to arrive at a fair value. In assessing the fair value, the Company utilizes the results of the valuations (including the market approach to the extent comparables are available) and considers the range of fair values determined under all methods and the extent to which the fair value exceeds the carrying amount of the reporting unit.\nThe valuation of each reporting unit includes the use of assumptions and estimates of many critical factors, including revenue growth rates and operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, determination of market multiples and the establishment of a control premium, among others. Forecasts of future operations are based, in part, on operating results and the Company's expectations as to future market conditions. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require the Company to make assumptions and to apply judgments to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. However, if actual results are not consistent with the Company's estimates and assumptions, the Company may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material.\nThe Company elected to perform qualitative assessments for 2015, 2014 and 2013, the results of which supported the conclusion that the fair values of the Company's reporting units were not more likely than not less than their carrying amounts and, therefore, a quantitative impairment test was not considered necessary. As a result of these assessments, the Company did not record any goodwill impairment losses for 2015, 2014 or 2013.\nImpairment assessment for other intangible assets. Management uses estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and excluding interest) to measure the recoverability of intangible assets with finite lives, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. If the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates that the carrying amount is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount over its fair value.\nManagement's impairment assessment for indefinite-lived other intangible assets may involve calculating the fair value by using a discounted cash flow analysis or through a market approach valuation. If the fair value exceeds its carrying amount, the asset is not considered impaired and no additional analysis is required. However, if the carrying amount is greater than the fair value, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the excess.\nImpairment of equity method investments in affiliates. The carrying value of equity method investments in affiliates is written down, or impaired, to fair value when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary. In making the determination as to whether an individual investment in an affiliate is impaired, the Company assesses the current and expected financial condition of each relevant entity, including, but not limited to, the anticipated ability of the entity to make its contractually required payments to the Company (with respect to debt obligations to the Company), the results of valuation work performed with respect to the entity, the entity's anticipated ability to generate sufficient cash flows and the market conditions in the industry in which the entity is operating. The Company recognized impairment losses of $2.0 million, $22.5 million and $7.8 million on its equity method investments for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nImpairment of property and equipment. Management uses estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and excluding interest) to measure the recoverability of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. If the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates that the carrying amount is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount over its fair value. The Company recognized impairment losses on software of $10.9 million, $1.2 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nIncome taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company evaluates the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based upon the amount of existing temporary differences, the period in which they are expected to be recovered and expected levels of taxable income. A valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is considered more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if sustaining those positions is considered more likely than not. Changes in recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions are reflected in the period in which a change in judgment occurs. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\nEmployee benefit plans. The Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined benefit pension and supplemental benefit plans as an asset or liability on its consolidated balance sheets and recognizes changes in the funded status in the year in which changes occur, through accumulated other comprehensive loss. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligation (the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the other postretirement plans). Actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits that have not been recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost previously are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Plan assets and obligations are measured annually as of December 31.\nThe assumptions that have had the most significant impact to net periodic costs are the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate assumption reflects the yield available on high-quality, fixed-income debt securities that match the expected timing of the benefit obligation payments. Assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on assets of the defined benefit pension plans are based on future expectations for returns for each asset class based on the calculated market-related value of plan assets and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing, adjusted for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets. See Note 13 Employee Benefit Plans to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets as well as asset allocation targets.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company elected to change the method it uses to estimate the interest and service components of net periodic cost for its defined benefit pension and supplemental benefit plans, which will impact the estimate of net periodic cost beginning in 2016. The Company will utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Previously, the Company estimated the interest and service cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. This change compared to the previous method will impact the interest and service components of net periodic cost in future periods. The Company made this change to provide a more precise measurement of interest and service costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. This change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation as the change in the interest and service costs is offset in net actuarial gains and losses. The impact to interest and service costs is not expected to be significant. The Company will account for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.\nWeighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine costs for the plans for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were as follows:\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Defined benefit pension plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.07\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.97\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.50\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.50\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unfunded supplemental benefit plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.80\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWeighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the plans at December 31, 2015 and 2014, were as follows:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Defined benefit pension plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.31\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.07\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unfunded supplemental benefit plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.33\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued updated guidance which changes the criteria for determining which disposals are required to be presented as discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements. The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nPending Accounting Pronouncements\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance intended to simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination and eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and applies prospectively to adjustments made to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of this guidance with early adoption permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance relating to the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Announcement at the June 18, 2015 Emerging Issues Task Force meeting on the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements. The updated guidance allows for the deferral and presentation of debt issuance costs as an asset which may be amortized ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any related outstanding borrowings. The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2015, the FASB issued updated disclosure guidance related to short-duration contracts issued by insurance entities. The updated guidance is intended to increase the transparency of significant estimates made in measuring liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses and to provide additional insight into an insurance entity's ability to underwrite and anticipate costs associated with claims. The updated guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and for interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. Except for the disclosure requirements, the Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to impact its consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance intended to eliminate the diversity in practice surrounding how investments measured at net asset value under the practical expedient with future redemption dates have been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. Under the updated guidance, investments for which fair value is measured at net asset value per share using the practical expedient should no longer be categorized in the fair value hierarchy. The updated guidance requires retrospective adoption for all periods presented and is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. Except for the disclosure requirements, the Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to impact its consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance intended to clarify the accounting treatment for cloud computing arrangements that include software licenses. Under the updated guidance, if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance intended to simplify, and provide consistency to, the presentation of debt issuance costs. The new standard requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance which changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects the adoption of this guidance to have no impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance intended to eliminate the diversity in practice regarding share-based payment awards that include terms which provide for a performance target that affects vesting being achieved after the requisite service period. The new standard requires that a performance target which affects vesting and could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition that affects vesting and should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value. The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects the adoption of this guidance to have no impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability within and across industries, and across capital markets. The new revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and the timing of recognition. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue from insurance contracts is not within the scope of this guidance. The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption prohibited. In August 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance which defers the effective date of this guidance by one year to interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted as of the original effective date. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nA substantial portion of the revenues for the Company's title insurance and services segment results from the sale and refinancing of residential and commercial real estate. In the Company's specialty insurance segment, revenues associated with the initial year of coverage in both the home warranty and property and casualty operations are impacted by volatility in residential purchase transactions. Traditionally, the greatest volume of real estate activity, particularly residential purchase activity, has occurred in the spring and summer months. However, changes in interest rates, as well as other changes in general economic conditions in the United States and abroad, can cause fluctuations in the traditional pattern of real estate activity.\nThe Company's total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $5.2 billion, which reflected an increase of $0.5 billion, or 10.6%, when compared with $4.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in commercial business, residential purchase transactions and residential refinance transactions during 2015. Direct premiums and escrow fees in the title insurance and services segment from commercial business, residential purchase transactions and residential refinance transactions increased 17.0%, 11.4% and 29.2%, respectively, in 2015 when compared to 2014.\nAccording to the Mortgage Bankers Association's February 18, 2016 Mortgage Finance Forecast (the MBA Forecast\u201d), residential mortgage originations in the United States (based on the total dollar value of the transactions) increased 29.3% in 2015 when compared with 2014. According to the MBA Forecast, the dollar amount of purchase originations increased 16.1% and refinance originations increased 49.2%. The higher volume of domestic residential mortgage origination activity in 2015 contributed to a 4.7% increase in domestic residential purchase orders closed per day and a 24.7% increase in domestic refinance orders closed per day by the Company's direct title operations in 2015 when compared to 2014.\nDespite uncertainties in the economy, the Company remains optimistic that the housing market will continue to strengthen in 2016. The Company anticipates growth in the residential purchase market and is benefiting from the recent decline in mortgage rates, which is positively impacting residential refinance volumes. The Company's direct title operations opened 1,700 refinance orders per day in January 2016 and have opened approximately 2,300 refinance orders per day so far in February 2016 (measured through February 17, 2016). It is uncertain how long this level of elevated refinance activity will continue. The Company expects growth rates in the commercial market to moderate relative to those experienced in 2015.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB\u201d) has broad authority to regulate, among other areas, the mortgage and real estate markets in matters which impact consumers. The CFPB has implemented regulations pertaining to the mortgage and settlement industries, including the TILA-RESPA integrated disclosure (TRID) rule. Implementation of the TRID rule, which applies to certain mortgage loan transactions originated on or after October 3, 2015, has required extensive modifications to the process of closing a federally-regulated mortgage loan. Compliance with the TRID rule also requires heightened coordination among market participants, including by settlement service providers, such as the Company and its agents, with lenders and others. After experiencing some initial delays in closings, by the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company's direct residential business returned to its typical closing timeframes. The full impact on closing timeframes for the Company's residential agency business for the fourth quarter of 2015 is not yet known. While initial facts and circumstances related to the Company's implementation of the TRID rule appear positive, the full impact of the TRID rule and the extent to which such impact is temporary or permanent is not currently known. There can be no assurance that the Company, its agents or other market participants will ultimately succeed in their implementation efforts, or that consumers or the CFPB will be satisfied with the manner in which the TRID rule has been implemented. The TRID rule may also impact other areas of the mortgage industry, including the volume of loans being originated.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded certain reclassifications and revisions to its consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. For further discussion of these reclassifications and revisions, see Note 1 Description of the Company to the consolidated financial statements, pages 53 and 54.\nTitle Insurance and Services\nTable

million, or 13.6%, in 2015 from 2014 and decreased $105.2 million, or 5.8%, in 2014 from 2013. The increase in direct premiums and escrow fees in 2015 from 2014 was primarily due to an increase in the domestic average revenues per order closed and an increase in domestic title orders closed by the Company's direct operations. The decrease in direct premiums and escrow fees in 2014 from 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in the number of domestic title orders closed by the Company's direct operations, partially offset by an increase in the domestic average revenues per order closed. The domestic average revenues per order closed were $2,012, $1,886 and $1,498 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The 6.7% increase in average revenues per order closed in 2015 from 2014 was primarily due to higher real estate values and a greater number of large commercial deals that closed when compared to the prior year, partially offset by an increase in the mix of direct revenues generated from lower premium residential refinance transactions. The 25.9% increase in average revenues per order closed in 2014 from 2013 was primarily due to an increase in the mix of direct revenues generated from higher premium residential purchase and commercial transactions, higher real estate values, and a greater number of large commercial deals that closed when compared to the prior year. The Company's direct title operations closed 882,400, 816,400 and 1,103,400 domestic title orders during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The 8.1% increase in orders closed in 2015 from 2014 and the 26.0% decrease in orders closed in 2014 from 2013 were generally consistent with the changes in residential mortgage origination activity in the United States as reported in the MBA Forecast.\nAgent premiums increased $230.9 million, or 12.4%, in 2015 from 2014 and decreased $194.0 million, or 9.4%, in 2014 from 2013. Agent premiums are recorded when notice of issuance is received from the agent, which is generally when cash payment is received by the Company. As a result, there is generally a delay between the agent's issuance of a title policy and the Company's recognition of agent premiums. Therefore, full year agent premiums typically reflect mortgage origination activity from the fourth quarter of the prior year through the third quarter of the current year. The increase in agent premiums in 2015 from 2014 was consistent with the 16.9% increase in the Company's direct premiums and escrow fees in the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 as compared with the twelve months ended September 30, 2014. The decrease in agent premiums in 2014 from 2013 was consistent with the 13.4% decrease in the Company's direct premiums and escrow fees in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 as compared with the twelve months ended September 30, 2013.\nInformation and other revenues primarily consist of revenues generated from fees associated with title search and related reports, title and other real property records and images, other non-insured settlement services, and risk mitigation products and services. These revenues generally trend with direct premiums and escrow fees but are typically less volatile since a portion of the revenues are subscription based and do not fluctuate with transaction volumes.\nInformation and other revenues increased $15.0 million, or 2.3%, in 2015 from 2014 and decreased $6.1 million, or 0.9%, in 2014 from 2013. Excluding the $23.2 million impact of new acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2015, information and other revenues decreased $8.2 million, or 1.2%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in 2015 from 2014, adjusted for the impact of new acquisitions, was due to lower demand for the Company's default information products as a result of the decrease in domestic loss mitigation activities, partially offset by higher demand for certain of the Company's non-insured services and products, which is directionally consistent with the increase in title insurance and services segment transaction volumes and revenue. Excluding the $55.7 million impact of new acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2014, information and other revenues decreased $61.9 million, or 9.4%, in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease in 2014 from 2013, adjusted for the impact of new acquisitions, was primarily attributable to lower demand for the Company's default and title plant information products as a result of the decrease in domestic loss mitigation, foreclosure and mortgage origination activities.\nNet investment income increased $37.7 million, or 63.1%, in 2015 from 2014 and decreased $16.8 million, or 22.0%, in 2014 from 2013. The increase in 2015 from 2014 was primarily attributable to higher interest income from the investment portfolio primarily due to higher average balances in the title insurance and services segment's debt securities portfolio in 2015 when compared to 2014 and lower impairment losses related to investments accounted for using the equity method when compared to 2014. The decrease in 2014 from 2013 was primarily attributable to higher impairment losses and lower equity in earnings related to investments accounted for using the equity method, partially offset by higher interest income from the investment portfolio primarily due to higher average balances in the title insurance and services segment's debt securities portfolio in 2014 when compared to 2013. Net investment income for 2015, 2014 and 2013 included impairment losses recognized on investments accounted for using the equity method of $2.0 million, $22.5 million and $5.8 million, respectively.\nNet realized investment losses for the title insurance and services segment totaled $7.4 million for 2015 and were primarily from the impairment of internally developed software and losses from the sales of equity securities, partially offset by gains from the sale of real estate. Net realized investment gains were $23.9 million for 2014 and were primarily from the sales of debt and equity securities and the sale of real estate. Net realized investment gains were $3.3 million for 2013 and were primarily from the sale of real estate. Net realized investment gains for 2015, 2014 and 2013 included $9.3 million, $7.5 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of gains from the sale of real estate, and included impairment losses of $10.9 million, $2.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively, primarily related to software and certain non-marketable investments accounted for using the cost method.\nThe title insurance and services segment (primarily direct operations) is labor intensive; accordingly, a major expense component is personnel costs. This expense component is affected by two primary factors: the need to monitor personnel changes to match the level of corresponding or anticipated new orders and the need to provide quality service.\nPersonnel costs increased $153.9 million, or 11.5%, in 2015 from 2014 and decreased $42.5 million, or 3.1%, in 2014 from 2013. Excluding the $19.3 million impact of new acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2015, personnel costs increased $134.6 million, or 10.1%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2015, adjusted for the impact of new acquisitions, was primarily attributable to higher incentive compensation costs, which include commissions, bonuses and 401(k) savings plan matches, due to higher revenue and profitability; higher salary expense due to higher headcount levels; and higher overtime and temporary labor costs driven by higher order volumes. Excluding the $37.8 million impact of new acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2014, personnel costs decreased $80.3 million, or 5.8%, in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease in 2014, adjusted for the impact of new acquisitions, was primarily attributable to lower salary, payroll taxes, employee benefit, temporary labor, overtime, and severance costs. The lower salary and payroll tax costs were attributable to reduced headcount when compared to the prior year. The lower employee benefit costs were due to changes in the Company's medical and dental insurance plans, lower incurred medical claims and lower headcount when compared to the prior year. The lower temporary labor and overtime costs were due to lower order volumes when compared to the prior year. The lower severance costs were due to a lower level of employee reductions made during 2014 when compared to 2013. Personnel costs included severance expense of $5.6 million, $8.9 million and $17.5 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe Company continues to closely monitor order volumes and related staffing levels and intends to adjust staffing levels as considered necessary. The Company's direct title operations opened 1,261,700, 1,155,500 and 1,384,600 domestic title orders in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, representing an increase of 9.2% in 2015 from 2014 and a decrease of 16.5% in 2014 from 2013.\nA summary of premiums retained by agents and agent premiums is as follows:\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Premiums retained by agents\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,656,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,472,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,637,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agent premiums\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,098,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,867,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,061,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % retained by agents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe premium split between underwriter and agents is in accordance with the respective agency contracts and can vary from region to region due to divergences in real estate closing practices and state regulations. As a result, the percentage of title premiums retained by agents can vary due to the geographic mix of revenues from agency operations. The increase in the percentage of title premiums retained by agents in 2015 from 2014 was primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of agency revenues towards higher agent-retention regions, partially offset by increased revenue from the issuance of closing protection letters since agents typically do not retain a portion of this revenue. The decrease in the percentage of title premiums retained by agents in 2014 from 2013 was primarily due to increased revenue from the issuance of closing protection letters and a change in the geographic mix of agency revenues towards lower agent-retention regions.\nOther operating expenses (principally related to direct operations) increased $8.8 million, or 1.2%, in 2015 from 2014 and decreased $37.3 million, or 4.8%, in 2014 from 2013. Excluding the $13.1 million impact of new acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2015, other operating expenses decreased $4.3 million, or 0.6%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in 2015 from 2014, adjusted for the impact of new acquisitions, was primarily attributable to higher bank earnings credits and lower professional services expenses, partially offset by higher production related expenses driven by higher order volumes and increased software related expenses. The increase in bank earnings credits was driven by higher average balances invested with third-party financial institutions and higher average earnings credit rates associated with those investments in 2015 when compared to 2014. Excluding the $29.0 million impact of new acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2014, other operating expenses decreased $66.3 million, or 8.6%, in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease in 2014 from 2013, adjusted for the impact of new acquisitions, was primarily attributable to lower production related expenses driven by lower order volumes.\nThe provision for policy losses and other claims, expressed as a percentage of title insurance premiums and escrow fees, was 6.6%, 7.1% and 8.9% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe current year rate of 6.6% reflects an ultimate loss rate of 4.2% for the current policy year and a $93.1 million net increase in loss reserve estimates for prior policy years. The increase in loss reserve estimates for prior policy years was primarily attributable to a change in methodology used by the Company's internal actuary to estimate total ultimate losses. Historically, the internal actuary's model did not separate claims experience for large title claims from normal title claims activity. A large title claim is defined as a title claim with a total ultimate loss in excess of $2.5 million. With this change in methodology, the model now separates claims experience for large title claims from normal title claims activity when developing reserve estimates. As a result, loss reserve estimates for prior policy years increased, primarily for policy years 2004 through 2007. The change in methodology was implemented due to the increased frequency of large title claims experienced over the last several years and the volatility associated with the timing and severity of large title claims. The Company accounted for this change in methodology as a change in accounting estimate.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the IBNR claims reserve for the title insurance and services segment was $844.4 million, which reflected management's best estimate. The Company's internal actuary determined a range of reasonable estimates of $719.5 million to $922.0 million. The range limits are $124.9 million below and $77.6 million above management's best estimate, respectively, and represent an estimate of the range of variation among reasonable estimates of the IBNR reserve. Actuarial estimates are sensitive to assumptions used in models, as well as the structures of the models themselves, and to changes in claims payment and incurral patterns, which can vary materially due to economic conditions, among other factors.\nThe prior year rate of 7.1% reflected an ultimate loss rate of 5.3% for policy year 2014 and a net increase in loss reserve estimates for prior policy years of $64.1 million. The increase in loss reserve estimates for prior policy years reflected claims development above expected levels during 2014, primarily from domestic commercial policies. The reserve strengthening associated with domestic commercial policies was $41.4 million and was primarily attributable to several large commercial claims, net of anticipated recoveries, mainly from mechanics liens, and primarily related to policy years 2003, 2005 and 2007. Other factors, including a large international commercial claim from policy year 2004, also contributed to the net increase in loss reserve estimates for prior policy years.\nThe 2013 rate of 8.9% reflected an ultimate loss rate of 5.0% for policy year 2013 and a net increase in loss reserve estimates for prior policy years of $150.2 million. The increase in loss reserve estimates for prior policy years reflected claims development above expected levels during 2013, primarily from domestic lenders policies, commercial policies and the Company's guaranteed valuation product offered in Canada. The reserve strengthening associated with domestic lenders policies was $67.4 million and was primarily attributable to increased claims frequency for policy years 2004 through 2008. The increased claims frequency was primarily due to mortgage lenders and servicers processing a large volume of foreclosures during 2013. As foreclosure processing increases, lenders claims generally increase, because lenders claims typically come from foreclosures in which the lender suffers a loss. At December 31, 2013, the Company expected the high level of foreclosure processing to continue in the near term as mortgage lenders and servicers worked through their foreclosure inventory. The reserve strengthening associated with domestic lenders policies reflected these expectations. The reserve strengthening associated with commercial policies was $38.8 million and was primarily attributable to several large commercial claims, mainly from mechanics liens, and primarily related to policy years 2007 and 2008. The reserve strengthening associated with the guaranteed valuation product offered in Canada was $21.7 million and was primarily attributable to claims frequency exceeding the Company's expectations during 2013. The increase in frequency primarily related to policy years 2007 and 2010.\nThe projected ultimate loss ratios, as of December 31, 2015, for policy years 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 4.2%, 4.7% and 3.7%, respectively.\nBased on current expectations for claims activity, in 2016, the Company expects its provision for policy losses and other claims, expressed as a percentage of title insurance premiums and escrow fees, to decline from 6.6%, the loss rate for 2015, to between 5% and 6%. However, this estimate may change based on actual claims experience among other factors.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $2.5 million, or 3.3%, in 2015 from 2014 and $10.9 million, or 16.2%, in 2014 from 2013. Excluding the $2.4 million impact of new acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2015, depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.1 million, or 0.1%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2014 was primarily attributable to the depreciation and amortization expense associated with developed technology and other intangible assets recorded in connection with new acquisitions completed during the first quarter of 2014. Excluding the $8.6 million impact of new acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2014, depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.3 million, or 3.4%, in 2014 compared to 2013.\nInsurers generally are not subject to state income or franchise taxes. However, in lieu thereof, a premium tax is imposed on certain operating revenues, as defined by statute. Tax rates and bases vary from state to state; accordingly, the total premium tax burden is dependent upon the geographical mix of operating revenues. The Company's noninsurance subsidiaries are subject to state income tax and do not pay premium tax. Accordingly, the Company's total tax burden at the state level for the title insurance and services segment is composed of a combination of premium taxes and state income taxes. Premium taxes as a percentage of title insurance premiums and escrow fees were 1.4% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and 1.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nThe profit margins for the title insurance business reflect the high cost of performing the essential services required before insuring title, whereas the corresponding revenues are subject to regulatory and competitive pricing restraints. Due to this relatively high proportion of fixed costs, title insurance profit margins generally improve as closed order volumes increase. Title insurance profit margins are affected by the composition (residential or commercial) and type (resale, refinancing or new construction) of real estate activity. Title insurance profit margins are also affected by the percentage of title insurance premiums generated by agency operations. Profit margins from direct operations are generally higher than from agency operations due primarily to the large portion of the premium that is retained by the agent. The pre-tax margins were 10.2%, 8.7% and 7.6% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nSpecialty Insurance\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

$24.6 million, or 7.5%, in 2014 from 2013. The increases were driven by higher premiums earned in the home warranty business and, to a lesser extent, higher premiums earned in the property and casualty business. The increase in 2015 from 2014 in the home warranty business was in its real estate, direct to consumer and renewal channels and was driven by an increase in the number of home warranty residential service contracts issued. The increase in 2014 from 2013 in the home warranty business was in its real estate, direct to consumer and renewal channels and was driven by an increase in the price charged for home warranty residential service contracts and an increase in the number of contracts issued. The increases in the property and casualty business were primarily in its independent broker and direct channels.\nNet investment income increased $1.6 million, or 21.4%, in 2015 from 2014 and was essentially flat in 2014 when compared to 2013. The increase in 2015 from 2014 was primarily attributable to higher interest income from the investment portfolio due to a higher average yield and higher average balances in the specialty insurance segment's debt securities portfolio in 2015 when compared to 2014.\nNet realized investment gains for the specialty insurance segment totaled $1.5 million, $5.3 million and $1.4 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and were primarily from the sales of debt and equity securities.\nPersonnel costs and other operating expenses increased $7.8 million, or 7.2%, in 2015 from 2014 and $7.7 million, or 7.7%, in 2014 from 2013. The increase in 2015 from 2014 was primarily related to higher corporate allocations for shared services support, higher offshore labor expense related to increased customer support activities associated with the increased volume in the home warranty business, and higher advertising expense in the home warranty business. The increase in 2014 from 2013 was primarily related to higher salary expense associated with higher average employee headcount during the current year related to increased volume in the home warranty business, higher incentive compensation related to higher revenue and profitability, higher production related expenses due to increased volumes, and increased amortization of deferred acquisition costs.\nThe provision for home warranty claims, expressed as a percentage of home warranty premiums, was 56.5% in 2015, 53.3% in 2014 and 57.5% in 2013. The increase in rate in 2015 from 2014 was primarily attributable to higher contract servicing costs due to an increase in the frequency of higher cost claims related to more severe weather conditions and less efficient claims management. The efficiency of claims management was adversely impacted by the increased level of claims opened in 2015 as a result of the higher volume of home warranty residential service contracts outstanding in 2015 when compared to 2014. The decrease in rate in 2014 from 2013 was primarily attributable to lower claims frequency and lower contract servicing costs due to milder weather conditions during the second and third quarters of 2014 when compared to the respective quarters of 2013. The rate in 2014 also benefited from an improvement in claims management in 2014 when compared to 2013.\nThe provision for property and casualty claims, expressed as a percentage of property and casualty insurance premiums, was 66.4% in 2015, 60.1% in 2014 and 55.4% in 2013. The increase in rate in 2015 from 2014 was primarily attributable to wildfires in northern California, hail storms in New Mexico, and an increase in the severity of claims, partially offset by a decrease in the frequency of claims. The increase in rate in 2014 from 2013 was primarily attributable to higher claims severity and frequency. 2014 was impacted by the severe winter weather experienced in the first quarter and the California wildfires that occurred during the second quarter.\nPremium taxes as a percentage of specialty insurance segment premiums were 1.8% in 2015 and 1.7% in 2014 and 2013.\nA large part of the revenues for the specialty insurance businesses are generated by renewals and are not dependent on the level of real estate activity in the year of renewal. With the exception of loss expense, the majority of the expenses for this segment are variable in nature and therefore generally fluctuate consistent with revenue fluctuations. Accordingly, profit margins for this segment (before loss expense) are relatively constant, although as a result of some fixed expenses, profit margins (before loss expense) should nominally improve as premium revenues increase. Pre-tax margins were 10.0%, 14.4% and 12.4% for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nCorporate\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

2013, respectively. The change in net investment income for all three years is primarily attributable to fluctuations in earnings on investments associated with the Company's deferred compensation plan. Net investment losses for 2015 were impacted by a one-time non-cash charge of $4.0 million, recorded during the first quarter of 2015, related to the investments associated with the Company's deferred compensation plan. Net investment income for 2013 included impairment losses recognized on investments accounted for using the equity method of $2.0 million.\nNet realized investment losses totaled $0.6 million in 2015 and were primarily attributable to the impairment of a non-marketable investment accounted for using the cost method. Net realized investment gains totaled $0.9 million and $4.5 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, and were attributable to the sale of non-marketable investments accounted for using the cost method.\nCorporate personnel costs and other operating expenses were $63.3 million, $61.1 million and $76.2 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase for 2015 was primarily attributable to increased expense related to the Company's defined benefit pension and supplemental benefit plans, partially offset by decreased expense related to the Company's deferred compensation plan. The decrease for 2014 was primarily attributable to decreased expense associated with the Company's defined benefit pension, supplemental benefit and deferred compensation plans.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $0.5 million, $2.8 million and $3.1 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in 2015 was due to a noncompete asset that was fully amortized during 2014.\nInterest expense increased $9.0 million in 2015 from 2014 and $2.7 million in 2014 from 2013. Interest expense increased in both 2015 and 2014 primarily due to the Company's issuance of $300.0 million of debt in November 2014. Interest expense related to intercompany notes payable to the title insurance and services and specialty insurance segments was $0.4 million, $1.5 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nEliminations\nEliminations primarily represent interest income and related interest expense associated with intercompany notes between the Company's segments, which are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The Company's inter-segment eliminations were not material for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes differ from the amounts computed by applying the federal income tax rate of 35.0%.

The differences in the effective tax rates were primarily due to changes in state and foreign income taxes resulting from fluctuations in the Company's noninsurance and foreign subsidiaries' contribution to pretax income and changes in the ratio of permanent differences to income before income taxes. In addition, the tax rate for 2014 reflected non-recurring tax benefits resulting from certain adjustments to the Company's state and non-U.S. tax accounts. The 2015 rate includes a benefit for the release of valuation allowances previously provided against certain foreign net operating losses and other deferred tax assets.\nNet Income and Net Income Attributable to the Company\nNet income and per share information are summarized as follows:\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except per share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 288,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 234,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 187,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to the Company\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 288,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 233,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 186,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income per share attributable to the Company's stockholders:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted-average common shares outstanding:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 106,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 106,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 12 Earnings Per Share to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of earnings per share.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash requirements. The Company generates cash primarily from the sale of its products and services and investment income. The Company's current cash requirements include operating expenses, taxes, payments of principal and interest on its debt, capital expenditures and dividends on its common stock, and may include business acquisitions and repurchases of its common stock. Management forecasts the cash needs of the holding company and its primary subsidiaries and regularly reviews their short-term and long-term projected sources and uses of funds, as well as the asset, liability, investment and cash flow assumptions underlying such forecasts. Due to the Company's ability to generate cash flows from operations and its liquid-asset position, management believes that its resources are sufficient to satisfy its anticipated operational cash requirements and obligations for at least the next twelve months.\nThe substantial majority of the Company's business is dependent upon activity in the real estate and mortgage markets, which are cyclical and seasonal. Periods of increasing interest rates and reduced mortgage financing availability generally have an adverse effect on residential real estate activity and therefore typically decrease the Company's revenues. In contrast, periods of declining interest rates and increased mortgage financing availability generally have a positive effect on residential real estate activity which typically increases the Company's revenues. Residential purchase activity is typically slower in the winter months with increased volumes in the spring and summer months. Residential refinance activity is typically more volatile than purchase activity and is highly impacted by changes in interest rates. Commercial real estate volumes are less sensitive to changes in interest rates, but fluctuate based on local supply and demand conditions for space and mortgage financing availability.\nCash provided by operating activities amounted to $551.3 million, $360.6 million and $378.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, after claim payments, net of recoveries, of $476.5 million, $469.8 million and $479.3 million, respectively. The principal nonoperating uses of cash and cash equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2015 were purchases of debt and equity securities, capital expenditures and dividends to common stockholders. The principal nonoperating uses of cash and cash equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2014 were purchases of debt and equity securities, repayment of debt, business acquisitions, capital expenditures and dividends to common stockholders. The principal nonoperating uses of cash and cash equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2013 were purchases of debt and equity securities, repayment of debt, capital expenditures, purchase of Company shares and payment of dividends to common stockholders. The most significant nonoperating sources of cash and cash equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2015 were proceeds from the sales and maturities of debt and equity securities and increases in the deposit balances at the Company's banking operations. The most significant nonoperating sources of cash and cash equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2014 were proceeds from the sales and maturities of debt and equity securities, increases in the deposit balances at the Company's banking operations, proceeds from the issuance of debt and paydowns and net proceeds related to the sale of loans receivable. The most significant nonoperating sources of cash and cash equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2013 were proceeds from the sales and maturities of debt and equity securities, increases in the deposit balances at the Company's banking operations, proceeds from the issuance of debt and paydowns of loans receivable. The net effect of all activities on total cash and cash equivalents was a decrease of $162.8 million, and increases of $355.2 million and $164.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe Company continually assesses its capital allocation strategy, including decisions relating to dividends, stock repurchases, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments. In January 2016, the Company's board of directors approved a first quarter cash dividend of 26 cents per common share. Management expects that the Company will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends at or above the current level. The timing, declaration and payment of future dividends, however, falls within the discretion of the Company's board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including the Company's financial condition and earnings, the capital requirements of the Company's businesses, industry practice, restrictions imposed by applicable law and any other factors the board of directors deems relevant from time to time.\nIn March 2014, the Company's board of directors approved an increase in the size of the Company's stock repurchase plan from $150.0 million to $250.0 million, of which $182.9 million remained as of December 31, 2015. Purchases may be made from time to time by the Company in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions. The Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the year ended December 31, 2015 and as of December 31, 2015, had repurchased and retired 3.2 million shares of its common stock under the current authorization for a total purchase price of $67.1 million. In January 2016, the Company repurchased and retired 14 thousand shares of its common stock for a total purchase price of $454 thousand.\nThe Company completed acquisitions in 2015 for an aggregate purchase price of $32.3 million.\nHolding company. First American Financial Corporation is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries. The holding company's current cash requirements include payments of principal and interest on its debt, taxes, payments in connection with employee benefit plans, dividends on its common stock and other expenses. The holding company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to meet its cash requirements. The Company's target is to maintain a cash balance at the holding company equal to at least twelve months of estimated cash requirements. At certain points in time, the actual cash balance at the holding company may vary from this target due to, among other factors, the timing and amount of cash payments made and dividend payments received. Pursuant to insurance and other regulations under which the Company's insurance subsidiaries operate, the amount of dividends, loans and advances available to the holding company is limited, principally for the protection of policyholders. As of December 31, 2015, under such regulations, the maximum amount of dividends, loans and advances available to the holding company from its insurance subsidiaries in 2016, without prior approval from applicable regulators, was $547.9 million. Such restrictions have not had, nor are they expected to have, an impact on the holding company's ability to meet its cash obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the holding company's sources of liquidity included $289.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $700.0 million available on the Company's revolving credit facility. Management believes that liquidity at the holding company is sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash requirements and obligations for at least the next twelve months.\nFinancing. The Company maintains a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in its capacity as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto. The credit agreement is comprised of a $700.0 million revolving credit facility. Unless terminated earlier, the revolving loan commitments under the credit agreement will terminate on May 14, 2019. The obligations of the Company under the credit agreement are neither secured nor guaranteed. Proceeds under the credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2015, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the facility.\nThe credit agreement includes an expansion option that permits the Company, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, to increase the revolving commitments and/or add term loan tranches ( Incremental Term Loans\u201d) in an aggregate amount not to exceed $150.0 million. Incremental Term Loans, if made, may not mature prior to the revolving commitment termination date, provided that amortization may occur prior to such date.\nAt the Company's election, borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at (a) the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable spread or (b) the Adjusted LIBOR rate plus the applicable spread (in each case as defined in the agreement). The Company may select interest periods of one, two, three or six months or (if agreed to by all lenders) such other number of months for Eurodollar borrowings of loans. The applicable spread varies depending upon the debt rating assigned by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ( Moody's\u201d) and/or Standard & Poor's Rating Services ( S&P\u201d). The minimum applicable spread for Alternate Base Rate borrowings is 0.625% and the maximum is 1.00%. The minimum applicable spread for Adjusted LIBOR rate borrowings is 1.625% and the maximum is 2.00%. The rate of interest on Incremental Term Loans will be established at or about the time such loans are made and may differ from the rate of interest on revolving loans.\nThe credit agreement includes representations and warranties, reporting covenants, affirmative covenants, negative covenants, financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type. Upon the occurrence of an event of default the lenders may accelerate the loans. Upon the occurrence of certain insolvency and bankruptcy events of default the loans will automatically accelerate. As of December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the credit agreement.\nIn addition to amounts available under its credit facility, certain subsidiaries of the Company are parties to master repurchase agreements which are used as part of the Company's liquidity management activities and to support its risk management activities. In particular, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements may be used as short-term funding sources. During 2015, the Company financed securities for funds received totaling $47.2 million under these agreements. As of December 31, 2015, no amounts remained outstanding under these agreements.\nNotes and contracts payable as a percentage of total capitalization was 17.5% and 18.6% at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Notes and contracts payable are further described in Note 9 Notes and Contracts Payable to the consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment portfolio. The Company maintains a high quality, liquid investment portfolio that is primarily held at its insurance and banking subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2015, 93% of the Company's investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities, of which 65% were United States government-backed or rated AAA and 95% were rated or classified as investment grade. Percentages are based on the estimated fair values of the securities. Credit ratings reflect published ratings obtained from S&P, DBRS, Inc., Fitch Ratings, Inc. and Moody's. If a security was rated differently among the rating agencies, the lowest rating was selected. For further information on the credit quality of the Company's investment portfolio at December 31, 2015, see Note 3 Debt and Equity Securities to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition to its debt and equity investment securities portfolio, the Company maintains certain money-market and other short-term investments.\nCapital expenditures. Capital expenditures primarily consist of capitalized software development costs, additions to property and equipment, additions to title plants and purchases of real estate data. Capital expenditures were $127.6 million, $99.4 million and $87.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in 2015 from 2014 primarily reflected increased spending in 2015 on software, real estate data, title plants and property and equipment. The increase in software in 2015 was mainly driven by the Company's effort to comply with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's TILA-RESPA integrated disclosure rule. The increase in 2014 from 2013 primarily related to increased spending in 2014 on software, real estate data and title plants, partially offset by lower spending in 2014 on property and equipment.\nContractual obligations. A summary of the Company's contractual obligations at December 31, 2015, by due date, is as follows:\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1\nyear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes and contracts payable\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 585,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 561,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on notes and contracts payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 205,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 314,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 116,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,699,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,699,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Claim losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 983,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 247,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 215,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 146,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 374,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pension and supplemental benefit plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 555,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 384,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,343,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,098,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 462,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 331,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,451,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe timing of claim payments is estimated and is not set contractually. Nonetheless, based on historical claims experience, the Company anticipates the above payment patterns. Changes in future claim settlement patterns, judicial decisions, legislation, economic conditions and other factors could affect the timing and amount of actual claim payments. The timing and amount of payments in connection with pension and supplemental benefit plans are based on the Company's current estimate and require the use of significant assumptions. Changes in significant assumptions could affect the amount and timing of pension and supplemental benefit plan payments. See Note 13 Employee Benefit Plans to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of management's significant assumptions. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments, or the amount by which the liability for the Company's uncertain tax positions will increase or decrease over time; therefore the liability of $23.8 million has not been included in the contractual obligations table. See Note 11 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the Company's liability for uncertain tax positions.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements. The Company administers escrow deposits and trust assets as a service to its customers. Escrow deposits totaled $6.6 billion and $6.3 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of which $2.6 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, were held at the Company's federal savings bank subsidiary, First American Trust, FSB. The escrow deposits held at First American Trust, FSB are temporarily invested in cash and cash equivalents and debt securities, with offsetting liabilities included in deposits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The remaining escrow deposits were held at third-party financial institutions.\nTrust assets held or managed by First American Trust, FSB totaled $3.0 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014. Escrow deposits held at third-party financial institutions and trust assets are not considered assets of the Company and, therefore, are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. However, the Company could be held contingently liable for the disposition of these assets.\nIn conducting its operations, the Company often holds customers' assets in escrow, pending completion of real estate transactions and, as a result, the Company has ongoing programs for realizing economic benefits with various financial institutions. The results from these programs are included in the consolidated financial statements as income or a reduction in expense, as appropriate, based on the nature of the arrangement and benefit received.\nThe Company facilitates tax-deferred property exchanges for customers pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code and tax-deferred reverse exchanges pursuant to Revenue Procedure 2000-37. As a facilitator and intermediary, the Company holds the proceeds from sales transactions and takes temporary title to property identified by the customer to be acquired with such proceeds. Upon the completion of each such exchange, the identified property is transferred to the customer or, if the exchange does not take place, an amount equal to the sales proceeds or, in the case of a reverse exchange, title to the property held by the Company is transferred to the customer. Like-kind exchange funds held by the Company totaled $2.8 billion and $2.4 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The like-kind exchange deposits are held at third-party financial institutions and, due to the structure utilized to facilitate these transactions, the proceeds and property are not considered assets of the Company and, therefore, are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. All such amounts are placed in deposit accounts insured, up to applicable limits, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company could be held contingently liable to the customer for the transfers of property, disbursements of proceeds and the returns on such proceeds.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company was contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by affiliates and third parties to banks and others totaling $8.2 million and $8.9 million, respectively. The guarantee arrangements relate to promissory notes and other contracts that contingently require the Company to make payments to the guaranteed party upon the failure of debtors to make scheduled payments according to the terms of the notes and contracts. The Company's maximum potential obligation under these guarantees totaled $8.2 million and $8.9 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and is limited in duration to the terms of the underlying indebtedness. The Company has not incurred any costs as a result of these guarantees and has not recorded a liability on its consolidated balance sheets related to these guarantees at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "The report is the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) for a company.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of First American Financial Corporation and all controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Investments in affiliates in which the Company exercises significant influence, but does not control and is not the primary beneficiary, are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in affiliates in which the Company does not exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for under the cost method.\nReportable Segments\nThe Company consists of the following reportable segments and a corporate function:\n \u00b7 The Company's title insurance and services segment issues title insurance policies on residential and commercial property in the United States and offers similar or related products and services internationally. This segment also provides closing and/or escrow services; accommodates tax-deferred exchanges of real estate; provides products, services and solutions involving the use of real property related data designed to mitigate risk or otherwise facilitate real estate transactions; maintains, manages and provides access to title plant records and images; and provides banking, trust and investment advisory services. The Company, through its principal title insurance subsidiary and such subsidiary's affiliates, transacts its title insurance business through a network of direct operations and agents. Through this network, the Company issues policies in the 49 states that permit the issuance of title insurance policies and the District of Columbia. The Company also offers title insurance and other insurance and guarantee products, as well as related settlement services in foreign countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and various other established and emerging markets. \n \u00b7 The Company's specialty insurance segment issues property and casualty insurance policies and sells home warranty products. The property and casualty insurance business provides insurance coverage to residential homeowners and renters for liability losses and typical hazards such as fire, theft, vandalism and other types of property damage. This business is licensed to issue policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and actively issues policies in 46 states. In certain markets it also offers preferred risk auto insurance to better compete with other carriers offering bundled home and auto insurance. The home warranty business provides residential service contracts that cover residential systems, such as heating and air conditioning systems, and appliances against failures that occur as the result of normal usage during the coverage period. This business currently operates in 39 states and the District of Columbia. \nThe corporate function consists primarily of certain financing facilities as well as the corporate services that support the Company's business operations.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. The Company's management considers the accounting policies described below to be the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions in preparing the Company's consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 Description of the Company to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the Company's significant accounting policies.\nProvision for policy losses. The Company provides for title insurance losses by a charge to expense when the related premium revenue is recognized. The amount charged to expense is generally determined by applying a rate (the loss provision rate) to total title insurance premiums and escrow fees. The Company's management estimates the loss provision rate at the beginning of each year and reassesses the rate quarterly to ensure that the resulting incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) loss reserve and known claims reserve included in the Company's consolidated balance sheets together reflect management's best estimate of the total costs required to settle all IBNR and known claims. If the ending IBNR reserve is not considered adequate, an adjustment is recorded.\nThe process of assessing the loss provision rate and the resulting IBNR reserve involves evaluation of the results of an in-house actuarial review. The Company's in-house actuary performs a reserve analysis utilizing generally accepted actuarial methods that incorporate cumulative historical claims experience and information provided by in-house claims and operations personnel. Current economic and business trends are also reviewed and used in the reserve analysis. These include conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, changes in residential and commercial real estate values, and changes in the levels of defaults and foreclosures that may affect claims levels and patterns of emergence, as well as any company-specific factors that may be relevant to past and future claims experience. Results from the analysis include, but are not limited to, a range of IBNR reserve estimates and a single point estimate for IBNR as of the balance sheet date.\nFor recent policy years at early stages of development (generally the last three years), IBNR is estimated using a combination of expected loss rate and multiplicative loss development factor calculations. For more mature policy years, IBNR generally is estimated using multiplicative loss development factor calculations. The expected loss rate method estimates IBNR by applying an expected loss rate to total title insurance premiums and escrow fees, and adjusting for policy year maturity using estimated loss development patterns. Multiplicative loss development factor calculations estimate IBNR by applying factors derived from loss development patterns to losses realized to date. The expected loss rate and loss development patterns are based on historical experience and the relationship of the history to the applicable policy years.\nThe Company's management uses the IBNR point estimate from the in-house actuary's analysis and other relevant information it may have concerning claims to determine what it considers to be the best estimate of the total amount required for the IBNR reserve.\nThe volume and timing of title insurance claims are subject to cyclical influences from real estate and mortgage markets. Title policies issued to lenders constitute a large portion of the Company's title insurance volume. These policies insure lenders against losses on mortgage loans due to title defects in the collateral property. Even if an underlying title defect exists that could result in a claim, often, the lender must realize an actual loss, or at least be likely to realize an actual loss, for title insurance liability to exist. As a result, title insurance claims exposure is sensitive to lenders' losses on mortgage loans, and is affected in turn by external factors that affect mortgage loan losses, particularly macroeconomic factors.\nA general decline in real estate prices can expose lenders to greater risk of losses on mortgage loans, as loan-to-value ratios increase and defaults and foreclosures increase. Title insurance claims exposure for a given policy year is also affected by the quality of mortgage loan underwriting during the corresponding origination year. The Company believes that sensitivity of claims to external conditions in real estate and mortgage markets is an inherent feature of title insurance's business economics that applies broadly to the title insurance industry.\nTitle insurance policies are long-duration contracts with the majority of the claims reported to the Company within the first few years following the issuance of the policy. Generally, 70% to 80% of claim amounts become known in the first six years of the policy life, and the majority of IBNR reserves relate to the six most recent policy years. Changes in expected ultimate losses and corresponding loss rates for recent policy years are considered likely and could result in a material adjustment to the IBNR reserves. Based on historical experience, management believes a 50 basis point change to the loss rates for the most recent policy years, positive or negative, is reasonably likely given the long duration nature of a title insurance policy. For example, if the expected ultimate losses for each of the last six policy years increased or decreased by 50 basis points, the resulting impact on the Company's IBNR reserve would be an increase or decrease, as the case may be, of $103.2 million. A material change in expected ultimate losses and corresponding loss rates for older policy years is also possible, particularly for policy years with loss ratios exceeding historical norms. The estimates made by management in determining the appropriate level of IBNR reserves could ultimately prove to be materially different from actual claims experience.\nThe Company provides for property and casualty insurance losses when the insured event occurs. The Company provides for claims losses relating to its home warranty business based on the average cost per claim as applied to the total of new claims incurred. The average cost per home warranty claim is calculated using the average of the most recent 12 months of claims experience adjusted for estimated future increases in costs.\nA summary of the Company's loss reserves is as follows:\n\nActivity in the reserve for known title claims is summarized as follows:\n\nOther\u201d for 2015 included recoveries of $23.8 million on reinsured losses related to a large commercial title claim.\nThe provision transferred from IBNR title claims related to current year decreased by $16.4 million in 2015 from 2014 and increased by $12.2 million in 2014 from 2013 and payments, net of recoveries, related to current year decreased by $11.0 million in 2015 from 2014 and increased by $6.9 million in 2014 from 2013, reflecting variability in claims volumes characteristic of a policy year during its first year of development. In addition, 2014 experienced a higher level of fraud losses when compared to 2015 and 2013.\nThe provision transferred from IBNR title claims related to prior years decreased by $90.0 million, or 32.8%, in 2015 from 2014 and decreased $5.9 million, or 2.1%, in 2014 from 2013. Payments, net of recoveries, related to prior years decreased by $6.3 million, or 2.5%, in 2015 from 2014 and decreased $30.8 million, or 11.0%, in 2014 from 2013. Generally, the provision transferred from IBNR title claims and payments are expected to decline with the runoff of older policy years that have higher expected ultimate losses, particularly policy years 2005 through 2008. This trend was partially impacted by the timing of the provision transferred from IBNR title claims and payments associated with certain large claims. During 2014, the Company transferred provision of $56.0 million from IBNR title claims related to these large claims, and the Company paid $35.0 million, net of $21.0 million recovered through reinsurance, during the first quarter of 2015 to settle these claims.\nActivity in the reserve for incurred but not reported title claims is summarized as follows:\n\nOther\u201d primarily included foreign currency translation gains and losses, assets acquired in connection with claim settlements, and recoveries. Other\u201d for 2014 included a reinsurance receivable of $25.0 million that related to a large commercial title claim.\nThe provision related to current year decreased by $18.2 million, or 9.6%, in 2015 from 2014. This decrease was attributable to a lower current year loss rate in 2015 when compared to 2014, partly offset by a 13.0% increase in title premiums and escrow fees in 2015 from 2014. The current year loss rate in 2015 was 4.2% compared to 5.3% in 2014.\nThe provision related to current year decreased by $5.5 million, or 2.8%, in 2014 from 2013. This decrease was attributable to a 7.7% decline in title premiums and escrow fees in 2014 from 2013, partly offset by a higher current year loss rate in 2014 when compared to 2013. The current year loss rate in 2014 was 5.3% compared to 5.0% in 2013.\nFor further discussion of title provision recorded in 2015, 2014 and 2013, see Results of Operations, pages 36 and 37.\nFair value of investment portfolio. The Company categorizes the fair value of its debt and equity securities using a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements that distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company (observable inputs) and the Company's own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy for inputs used in determining fair value maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy level assigned to each security in the Company's available-for-sale portfolio was based on management's assessment of the transparency and reliability of the inputs used to estimate the fair values at the measurement date. See Note 14 Fair Value Measurements to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the three-level hierarchy and a description for each level.\nThe valuation techniques and inputs used to estimate the fair value of the Company's debt and equity securities are summarized as follows:\nFair value of debt securities\nThe fair values of debt securities were based on the market values obtained from independent pricing services that were evaluated using pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information and price quotes from well-established independent broker-dealers. The independent pricing services monitor market indicators, industry and economic events, and for broker-quoted only securities, obtain quotes from market makers or broker-dealers that they recognize to be market participants. The pricing services utilize the market approach in determining the fair value of the debt securities held by the Company. The Company obtains an understanding of the valuation models and assumptions utilized by the services and has controls in place to determine that the values provided represent fair value. The Company's validation procedures include comparing prices received from the pricing services to quotes received from other third party sources for certain securities with market prices that are readily verifiable. If the price comparison results in differences over a predefined threshold, the Company will assess the reasonableness of the changes relative to prior periods given the prevailing market conditions and assess changes in the issuers' credit worthiness, performance of any underlying collateral and prices of the instrument relative to similar issuances. To date, the Company has not made any material adjustments to the fair value measurements provided by the pricing services.\nTypical inputs and assumptions to pricing models used to value the Company's U.S. Treasury bonds, municipal bonds, foreign government bonds, governmental agency bonds, governmental agency mortgage-backed securities, U.S. and foreign corporate debt securities include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, credit spreads, credit ratings, bond insurance (if applicable), benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data and industry and economic events. For mortgage-backed securities, inputs and assumptions may also include the structure of issuance, characteristics of the issuer, collateral attributes and prepayment speeds. Non-agency mortgage-backed securities and certain U.S. and foreign corporate debt securities were not actively traded and there were fewer observable inputs available requiring the use of more judgment in determining their fair values, which resulted in their classification as Level 3.\nOther-than-temporary impairment-debt securities\nIf the Company intends to sell a debt security in an unrealized loss position or determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell a debt security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the debt security is other-than-temporarily impaired and it is written down to fair value with all losses recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2015, the Company did not intend to sell any debt securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis.\nIf the Company does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of a debt security with declines in fair value (even if the Company does not intend to sell the debt security and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security), the losses the Company considers to be the credit portion of the other-than-temporary impairment loss ( credit loss\u201d) is recognized in earnings and the non-credit portion is recognized in other comprehensive income. The credit loss is the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security. The cash flows expected to be collected are discounted at the rate implicit in the security immediately prior to the recognition of the other-than-temporary impairment.\nExpected future cash flows for debt securities are based on qualitative and quantitative factors specific to each security, including the probability of default and the estimated timing and amount of recovery. The detailed inputs used to project expected future cash flows may be different depending on the nature of the individual debt security.\nThe Company recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses considered to be credit related on its debt securities of $2.2 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment losses related to its debt securities for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nFair value of equity securities\nThe fair values of equity securities, including preferred and common stocks, were based on quoted market prices for identical assets that are readily and regularly available in an active market.\nOther-than-temporary impairment-equity securities\nWhen a decline in the fair value of an equity security, including common and preferred stock, is considered to be other-than-temporary, such equity security is written down to its fair value. When assessing if a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the factors considered include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost, the probability that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the security, the seniority of the securities, issuer-specific news and other developments, the financial condition and prospects of the issuer (including credit ratings), macro-economic changes (including the outlook for industry sectors, which includes government policy initiatives) and the Company's ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery.\nWhen an equity security has been in an unrealized loss position and its fair value is less than 80% of cost for twelve consecutive months, the Company's review of the security includes the above noted factors as well as other evidence that might exist supporting the view that the security will recover its value in the foreseeable future, typically within the next twelve months. If objective, substantial evidence does not indicate a likely recovery during that timeframe, the Company's policy is that such losses are considered other-than-temporary and therefore an impairment loss is recorded. The Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment losses related to its equity securities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nLitigation and regulatory contingencies. The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of ongoing routine and non-ordinary course legal proceedings. For those lawsuits where the Company has determined that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, a liability representing the best estimate of the Company's financial exposure based on known facts has been recorded. Actual losses may materially differ from the amounts recorded. For a substantial majority of these lawsuits it is not possible to assess the probability of loss. Most of these lawsuits are putative class actions which require a plaintiff to satisfy a number of procedural requirements before proceeding to trial. As a result of, among other factors, ambiguities and inconsistencies in the myriad laws applicable to the Company's business and the uniqueness of the factual issues presented in any given lawsuit, the Company often cannot determine the probability of loss until a court has finally determined that a plaintiff has satisfied applicable procedural requirements. Furthermore, because most of these lawsuits are putative class actions, it is often impossible to estimate the possible loss or a range of loss amounts, even where the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible. In addition, many of the Company's businesses are regulated by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies and are subject to numerous statutory guidelines. These regulations and statutory guidelines often are complex, inconsistent or ambiguous, which results in additional uncertainty as to the outcome of a given lawsuit-including the amount of damages a plaintiff might be afforded-or makes it difficult to analogize experience in one case or jurisdiction to another case or jurisdiction.\nBusiness Combinations. The Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nCritical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, useful lives and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, may differ from actual results. Other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nImpairment assessment for goodwill. The Company is required to perform an annual goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit. The Company's four reporting units are title insurance, home warranty, property and casualty insurance and trust and other services. The Company has elected to perform this annual assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or sooner if circumstances indicate possible impairment. Based on current guidance, the Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of greater than 50%) less than the carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test, or may choose to forego the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative impairment test. The qualitative factors considered in this assessment may include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance as well as other relevant events and circumstances as determined by the Company. The Company evaluates the weight of each factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that impairment may exist. If the results of the qualitative assessment indicate the more likely than not threshold was not met, the Company may choose not to perform the quantitative impairment test. If, however, the more likely than not threshold is met, the Company performs the quantitative test as required and discussed below.\nManagement's quantitative impairment testing process includes two steps. The first step ( Step 1\u201d) compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. The fair value of each reporting unit is determined by using discounted cash flow analysis and market approach valuations. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill is not considered impaired and no additional analysis is required. However, if the carrying amount is greater than the fair value, a second step ( Step 2\u201d) must be completed to determine if the fair value of the goodwill exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill.\nStep 2 involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which Step 1 indicated impairment. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in Step 1, over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess. An impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit, and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill. Subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted.\nThe quantitative impairment test for goodwill utilizes a variety of valuation techniques, all of which require the Company to make estimates and judgments. Fair value is determined by employing an expected present value technique, which utilizes multiple cash flow scenarios that", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCERTAIN STATEMENTS IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 27A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND SECTION 21E OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED.

The Company provides for title insurance losses by a charge to expense when the related premium revenue is recognized. The amount charged to expense is generally determined by applying a rate (the loss provision rate) to total title insurance premiums and escrow fees. The Company's management estimates the loss provision rate at the beginning of each year and reassesses the rate quarterly to ensure that the resulting incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) loss reserve and known claims reserve included in the Company's consolidated balance sheets together reflect management's best estimate of the total costs required to settle all IBNR and known claims. If the ending IBNR reserve is not considered adequate, an adjustment is recorded.\nThe process of assessing the loss provision rate and the resulting IBNR reserve involves evaluation of the results of an in-house actuarial review. The Company's in-house actuary performs a reserve analysis utilizing generally accepted actuarial methods that incorporate cumulative historical claims experience and information provided by in-house claims and operations personnel. Current economic and business trends are also reviewed and used in the reserve analysis. These include conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, changes in residential and commercial real estate values, and changes in the levels of defaults and foreclosures that may affect claims levels and patterns of emergence, as well as any company-specific factors that may be relevant to past and future claims experience. Results from the analysis include, but are not limited to, a range of IBNR reserve estimates and a single point estimate for IBNR as of the balance sheet date.\nFor recent policy years at early stages of development (generally the last three years), IBNR is estimated using a combination of expected loss rate and multiplicative loss development factor calculations. For more mature policy years, IBNR generally is estimated using multiplicative loss development factor calculations. The expected loss rate method estimates IBNR by applying an expected loss rate to total title insurance premiums and escrow fees, and adjusting for policy year maturity using estimated loss development patterns. Multiplicative loss development factor calculations estimate IBNR by applying factors derived from loss development patterns to losses realized to date. The expected loss rate and loss development patterns are based on historical experience and the relationship of the history to the applicable policy years.\nThe Company's management uses the IBNR point estimate from the in-house actuary's analysis and other relevant information it may have concerning claims to determine what it considers to be the best estimate of the total amount required for the IBNR reserve.\nThe volume and timing of title insurance claims are subject to cyclical influences from real estate and mortgage markets. Title policies issued to lenders constitute a large portion of the Company's title insurance volume. These policies insure lenders against losses on mortgage loans due to title defects in the collateral property. Even if an underlying title defect exists that could result in a claim, often, the lender must realize an actual loss, or at least be likely to realize an actual loss, for title insurance liability to exist. As a result, title insurance claims exposure is sensitive to lenders' losses on mortgage loans, and is affected in turn by external factors that affect mortgage loan losses, particularly macroeconomic factors.\nA general decline in real estate prices can expose lenders to greater risk of losses on mortgage loans, as loan-to-value ratios increase and defaults and foreclosures increase. Title insurance claims exposure for a given policy year is also affected by the quality of mortgage loan underwriting during the corresponding origination year. The Company believes that sensitivity of claims to external conditions in real estate and mortgage markets is an inherent feature of title insurance's business economics that applies broadly to the title insurance industry.\nTitle insurance policies are long-duration contracts with the majority of the claims reported to the Company within the first few years following the issuance of the policy. Generally, 70% to 80% of claim amounts become known in the first six years of the policy life, and the majority of IBNR reserves relate to the six most recent policy years. Changes in expected ultimate losses and corresponding loss rates for recent policy years are considered likely and could result in a material adjustment to the IBNR reserves. Based on historical experience, management believes a 50 basis point change to the loss rates for the most recent policy years, positive or negative, is reasonably likely given the long duration nature of a title insurance policy. For example, if the expected ultimate losses for each of the last six policy years increased or decreased by 50 basis points, the resulting impact on the Company's IBNR reserve would be an increase or decrease, as the case may be, of $103.2 million. A material change in expected ultimate losses and corresponding loss rates for older policy years is also possible, particularly for policy years with loss ratios exceeding historical norms. The estimates made by management in determining the appropriate level of IBNR reserves could ultimately prove to be materially different from actual claims experience.\nThe Company provides for property and casualty insurance losses when the insured event occurs. The Company provides for claims losses relating to its home warranty business based on the average cost per claim as applied to the total of new claims incurred. The average cost per home warranty claim is calculated using the average of the most recent 12 months of claims experience adjusted for estimated future increases in costs.\nA summary of the Company's loss reserves is as follows:\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

reinsured losses related to a large commercial title claim.\nThe provision transferred from IBNR title claims related to current year decreased by $16.4 million in 2015 from 2014 and increased by $12.2 million in 2014 from 2013 and payments, net of recoveries, related to current year decreased by $11.0 million in 2015 from 2014 and increased by $6.9 million in 2014 from 2013, reflecting variability in claims volumes characteristic of a policy year during its first year of development. In addition, 2014 experienced a higher level of fraud losses when compared to 2015 and 2013.\nThe provision transferred from IBNR title claims related to prior years decreased by $90.0 million, or 32.8%, in 2015 from 2014 and decreased $5.9 million, or 2.1%, in 2014 from 2013. Payments, net of recoveries, related to prior years decreased by $6.3 million, or 2.5%, in 2015 from 2014 and decreased $30.8 million, or 11.0%, in 2014 from 2013. Generally, the provision transferred from IBNR title claims and payments are expected to decline with the runoff of older policy years that have higher expected ultimate losses, particularly policy years 2005 through 2008. This trend was partially impacted by the timing of the provision transferred from IBNR title claims and payments associated with certain large claims. During 2014, the Company transferred provision of $56.0 million from IBNR title claims related to these large claims, and the Company paid $35.0 million, net of $21.0 million recovered through reinsurance, during the first quarter of 2015 to settle these claims.\nActivity in the reserve for incurred but not reported title claims is summarized as follows:\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at beginning of year\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 802,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 840,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 805,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision related to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 170,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 188,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 194,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prior years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 93,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 150,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 263,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 253,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 344,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision transferred to known title claims related to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prior years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 184,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 274,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 280,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 198,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 304,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 298,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23,544\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,962\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at end of year\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 844,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 802,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 840,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther\u201d primarily included foreign currency translation gains and losses, assets acquired in connection with claim settlements, and recoveries.

This decrease was attributable to a lower current year loss rate in 2015 when compared to 2014, partly offset by a 13.0% increase in title premiums and escrow fees in 2015 from 2014. The current year loss rate in 2015 was 4.2% compared to 5.3% in 2014.\nThe provision related to current year decreased by $5.5 million, or 2.8%, in 2014 from 2013. This decrease was attributable to a 7.7% decline in title premiums and escrow fees in 2014 from 2013, partly offset by a higher current year loss rate in 2014 when compared to 2013. The current year loss rate in 2014 was 5.3% compared to 5.0% in 2013.\nFor further discussion of title provision recorded in 2015, 2014 and 2013, see Results of Operations, pages 36 and 37.\nFair value of investment portfolio. The Company categorizes the fair value of its debt and equity securities using a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements that distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company (observable inputs) and the Company's own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy for inputs used in determining fair value maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy level assigned to each security in the Company's available-for-sale portfolio was based on management's assessment of the transparency and reliability of the inputs used to estimate the fair values at the measurement date. See Note 14 Fair Value Measurements to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the three-level hierarchy and a description for each level.\nThe valuation techniques and inputs used to estimate the fair value of the Company's debt and equity securities are summarized as follows:\nFair value of debt securities\nThe fair values of debt securities were based on the market values obtained from independent pricing services that were evaluated using pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information and price quotes from well-established independent broker-dealers. The independent pricing services monitor market indicators, industry and economic events, and for broker-quoted only securities, obtain quotes from market makers or broker-dealers that they recognize to be market participants. The pricing services utilize the market approach in determining the fair value of the debt securities held by the Company. The Company obtains an understanding of the valuation models and assumptions utilized by the services and has controls in place to determine that the values provided represent fair value. The Company's validation procedures include comparing prices received from the pricing services to quotes received from other third party sources for certain securities with market prices that are readily verifiable. If the price comparison results in differences over a predefined threshold, the Company will assess the reasonableness of the changes relative to prior periods given the prevailing market conditions and assess changes in the issuers' credit worthiness, performance of any underlying collateral and prices of the instrument relative to similar issuances. To date, the Company has not made any material adjustments to the fair value measurements provided by the pricing services.\nTypical inputs and assumptions to pricing models used to value the Company's U.S. Treasury bonds, municipal bonds, foreign government bonds, governmental agency bonds, governmental agency mortgage-backed securities, U.S. and foreign corporate debt securities include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, credit spreads, credit ratings, bond insurance (if applicable), benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data and industry and economic events. For mortgage-backed securities, inputs and assumptions may also include the structure of issuance, characteristics of the issuer, collateral attributes and prepayment speeds. Non-agency mortgage-backed securities and certain U.S. and foreign corporate debt securities were not actively traded and there were fewer observable inputs available requiring the use of more judgment in determining their fair values, which resulted in their classification as Level 3.\nOther-than-temporary impairment-debt securities\nIf the Company intends to sell a debt security in an unrealized loss position or determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell a debt security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the debt security is other-than-temporarily impaired and it is written down to fair value with all losses recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2015, the Company did not intend to sell any debt securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis.\nIf the Company does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of a debt security with declines in fair value (even if the Company does not intend to sell the debt security and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security), the losses the Company considers to be the credit portion of the other-than-temporary impairment loss ( credit loss\u201d) is recognized in earnings and the non-credit portion is recognized in other comprehensive income. The credit loss is the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security. The cash flows expected to be collected are discounted at the rate implicit in the security immediately prior to the recognition of the other-than-temporary impairment.\nExpected future cash flows for debt securities are based on qualitative and quantitative factors specific to each security, including the probability of default and the estimated timing and amount of recovery. The detailed inputs used to project expected future cash flows may be different depending on the nature of the individual debt security.\nThe Company recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses considered to be credit related on its debt securities of $2.2 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment losses related to its debt securities for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nFair value of equity securities\nThe fair values of equity securities, including preferred and common stocks, were based on quoted market prices for identical assets that are readily and regularly available in an active market.\nOther-than-temporary impairment-equity securities\nWhen a decline in the fair value of an equity security, including common and preferred stock, is considered to be other-than-temporary, such equity security is written down to its fair value. When assessing if a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the factors considered include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost, the probability that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the security, the seniority of the securities, issuer-specific news and other developments, the financial condition and prospects of the issuer (including credit ratings), macro-economic changes (including the outlook for industry sectors, which includes government policy initiatives) and the Company's ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery.\nWhen an equity security has been in an unrealized loss position and its fair value is less than 80% of cost for twelve consecutive months, the Company's review of the security includes the above noted factors as well as other evidence that might exist supporting the view that the security will recover its value in the foreseeable future, typically within the next twelve months. If objective, substantial evidence does not indicate a likely recovery during that timeframe, the Company's policy is that such losses are considered other-than-temporary and therefore an impairment loss is recorded. The Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment losses related to its equity securities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nLitigation and regulatory contingencies. The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of ongoing routine and non-ordinary course legal proceedings. For those lawsuits where the Company has determined that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, a liability representing the best estimate of the Company's financial exposure based on known facts has been recorded. Actual losses may materially differ from the amounts recorded. For a substantial majority of these lawsuits it is not possible to assess the probability of loss. Most of these lawsuits are putative class actions which require a plaintiff to satisfy a number of procedural requirements before proceeding to trial. As a result of, among other factors, ambiguities and inconsistencies in the myriad laws applicable to the Company's business and the uniqueness of the factual issues presented in any given lawsuit, the Company often cannot determine the probability of loss until a court has finally determined that a plaintiff has satisfied applicable procedural requirements. Furthermore, because most of these lawsuits are putative class actions, it is often impossible to estimate the possible loss or a range of loss amounts, even where the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible. In addition, many of the Company's businesses are regulated by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies and are subject to numerous statutory guidelines. These regulations and statutory guidelines often are complex, inconsistent or ambiguous, which results in additional uncertainty as to the outcome of a given lawsuit-including the amount of damages a plaintiff might be afforded-or makes it difficult to analogize experience in one case or jurisdiction to another case or jurisdiction.\nBusiness Combinations. The Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nCritical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, useful lives and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, may differ from actual results. Other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nImpairment assessment for goodwill. The Company is required to perform an annual goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit. The Company's four reporting units are title insurance, home warranty, property and casualty insurance and trust and other services. The Company has elected to perform this annual assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or sooner if circumstances indicate possible impairment. Based on current guidance, the Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of greater than 50%) less than the carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test, or may choose to forego the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative impairment test. The qualitative factors considered in this assessment may include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance as well as other relevant events and circumstances as determined by the Company. The Company evaluates the weight of each factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that impairment may exist. If the results of the qualitative assessment indicate the more likely than not threshold was not met, the Company may choose not to perform the quantitative impairment test. If, however, the more likely than not threshold is met, the Company performs the quantitative test as required and discussed below.\nManagement's quantitative impairment testing process includes two steps. The first step ( Step 1\u201d) compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. The fair value of each reporting unit is determined by using discounted cash flow analysis and market approach valuations. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill is not considered impaired and no additional analysis is required. However, if the carrying amount is greater than the fair value, a second step ( Step 2\u201d) must be completed to determine if the fair value of the goodwill exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill.\nStep 2 involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which Step 1 indicated impairment. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in Step 1, over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess. An impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit, and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill. Subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted.\nThe quantitative impairment test for goodwill utilizes a variety of valuation techniques, all of which require the Company to make estimates and judgments. Fair value is determined by employing an expected present value technique, which utilizes multiple cash flow scenarios that"}
