See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the Financial Statements for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOperational and Financial Objectives\nCorporate Activities\nThe Company holds a 100% interest in the Perlas Block (560,000 acres/2,268 km) and Tyra Block (826,000 acres/3,342 km) located in shallow waters offshore Nicaragua. The Company received notification of final approval of the EIA by the Nicaraguan government on April 13, 2013, which began Sub-Period 2 as defined in the Nicaraguan concessions. Therefore, the Company has progressed to Sub-Period 2 of the exploration phase of the 30-year Concession for both Perlas and Tyra as of December 31, 2014. In accordance with the Nicaraguan Concession agreements, the Company has provided the Ministry of Energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts of $443,100 for Perlas (expired March 2014) and $408,450 for Tyra (expired September 2014). The Company has also made all required expenditures related to the Nicaraguan Concessions for training programs and as area fees,\u201d for each respective year for 2010 through 2014. The Company is currently negotiating the renewal of the required letters of credit with the Nicaraguan Government and its lenders; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in that regard. The Company considers it is fully in compliance with the terms of the Nicaraguan Concessions agreements, except for the renewal of the expired letters of credit, and is in year three of the exploration phase of the 30-year Nicaraguan Concessions.\nDuring December 2013 and January 2014, we completed the 2-D and 3-D seismic survey activities in the area as required under both of the Nicaraguan Concessions at this point. We believe that the newly acquired 2-D and 3-D seismic data, together with the previously acquired reprocessed 2-D seismic, will help us to further evaluate the structures that were previously identified with 2-D seismic in the Eocene Zone. Our geological consultants have estimated that these Eocene structures may contain recoverable oil in place. In addition, the 3-D seismic should provide our first geological information regarding the potential for oil resources in the Cretaceous Zone, which we could not evaluate using less precise 2-D seismic mapping. The evaluation of the newly acquired seismic data is ongoing in order to determine the scope our exploration program.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations) or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have material current or future effect on financial conditions, changes in the financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or significant components of revenue or expenses.\nTable 52: <table><tr><td>19 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nResults of Operations\nOperational and Financial Objectives\nCorporate Activities\nWe hold a 100% working interest in any hydrocarbon deposits found under the Perlas Block (560,000 acres/2,268 km) and Tyra Block (826,000 acres/3,342 km) located in shallow waters offshore Nicaragua. The final approval of the EIA by the Nicaraguan government of our environment impact study on April 13, 2013, began Sub-Period 2 for both the Tyra and Perlas Blocks as defined in the Nicaraguan Concessions. We believe we have satisfied the acquisition, processing and interpretation of Seismic data required in Sub-Period 2 for both the Perlas and Tyra Blocks. Therefore, we are now in Sub-Period 3 of the exploration phase of the 30-year Concession for both Perlas and Tyra as of December 31, 2015. Sub-Period 3 of the Nicaraguan Concessions requires the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block during 2016 and the shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block. We are in process of identifying at least one potential drilling site on the Perlas block as required in Sub-Period 3 and will have to perform supplemental EIA work prior to requesting and receiving the permit to drill from the Nicaraguan government. The work plan on the Tyra block for Sub-Period 3 requires us to shoot additional seismic, which is estimated to cost approximately $2,500,000 prior to the commencement of exploratory drilling. We are negotiating with the Nicaraguan government to seek a waiver of such additional seismic mapping on the Tyra Block so that we can proceed with exploratory drilling. There can be no assurance whether we will be able to obtain such waiver of the requirement.\nDuring late December 2013, we completed the 2-D seismic survey activities in the area as required under both of the Nicaraguan Concessions at that point. We believe that the newly acquired 2-D seismic data, together with the previously acquired reprocessed 2-D seismic, helped us to further evaluate the structures that were previously identified with 2-D seismic in the Eocene Zone. Our geological consultants have estimated that these Eocene structures may contain recoverable hydrocarbons (principally oil) in place. In addition, the new 2-D seismic acquired in 2013 provided our first geological information regarding the potential for oil resources in the Cretaceous Zone, which we could not evaluate using less precise older 2-D seismic mapping. We have identified multiple promising sites on the Perlas Block for exploratory drilling and is planning the drilling of initial exploratory wells in order to determine the existence of commercial hydrocarbon reserves. We believe that we have performed all work necessary as of December 31, 2015 to proceed to Sub-Period 3 for the Perlas Block as defined in the Nicaraguan Concessions, which requires the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas concession within the following one-year period. We must first prepare and submit a supplemental EIA to the Nicaraguan government before the drilling permit can be issued on the Perlas Block.\nWe must prepare and submit the EIA supplement to the Nicaraguan Government, assuming that it does accept the supplemental EIA and grant the drilling permit, we will be required to drill at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block within one-year (estimated to be prior to May 2016) or risk being in default and losing its rights under the Nicaraguan Concessions. We do not believe that we will proceed to drilling the Nicaraguan Concessions during 2016 given the current state of the oil and gas commodity markets, financing the drilling, and the challenging economics for any new exploration and development project, especially a project in an area of the world without historical proven reserves of commercial hydrocarbons. We believe that we can negotiate extensions with the Nicaraguan government of the required date by which an exploratory well must be drilled; however, there can be no assurance in this regard.\nThe Company is in technical default of the Nicaraguan Concession because it has not provided the required letters of credit to the Nicaraguan Government. In accordance with the Nicaraguan Concession agreements, the Company had previously provided the Ministry of Energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts of $443,100 for Perlas (expired March 2014) and $408,450 for Tyra (expired September 2014). The Company had also made all required expenditures related to the Nicaraguan Concessions for training programs and as area fees,\u201d for each respective year for 2010 through 2015. The Company is currently negotiating the renewal and increase of the required letters of credit which total $1,356,227 for the Perlas block and $278,450 for the Tyra block with the Nicaraguan Government and its lenders; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in the regard. The Company considers it is fully in compliance with the terms of the Nicaraguan Concessions agreements, except for the renewal of the expired letters of credit.\nTable 54: <table><tr><td>20 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are also seeking offers from industry operators and other third parties for interests in the acreage in the Nicaraguan Concessions in exchange for cash and a carried interest in exploration and development operations or other joint venture arrangement. Accordingly, we intend to finance our business strategy through external financing, which may include debt and equity capital raised in public and private offerings, joint ventures, sale of working or other interests, employment of working capital and cash flow from operations, if any, and net proceeds from the sales of assets.\nOur ability to complete these activities is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>The availability of the capital resources required to fund the activities; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>The availability of third party contractors for completion services; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>The approval by regulatory agencies of applications for permits to conduct exploration activities in a timely manner. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe do not expect that we will be able to meet the Nicaraguan Concession requirements and proceed to drilling the required exploration wells during 2016 given the current state of the oil and gas commodity markets, the availability of financing and the challenging economics for any new exploration and development project, especially a project in an area of the world without historical proven reserves of commercial hydrocarbons. We believe that we will be able to negotiate extensions with the Nicaraguan government of the required date by which an exploratory well must be drilled; however, there can be no assurance in this regard. These remain as substantial operational and legal issues that we must resolve in order to maintain our rights under the Nicaraguan Concessions during 2016.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations) or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have material current or future effect on financial conditions, changes in the financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or significant components of revenue or expenses.\nResults of Operations\nReverse Stock Split\nIn November 2015, we filed an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to effect a one-for-ten reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Our authorized shares and par value per share remain unchanged. All common stock share and per share information in the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted to reflect retrospective application of the reverse split, unless otherwise indicated. See Note 5- Common Stock\u201d to the Financial Statements for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 for additional information about the Reverse Split.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nThe Company incurred a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $10,996,243, or $4.07 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $3,707,052, or $1.46 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company issued Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred effective April 13, 2012. The 6% cumulative dividend accrued as well as the accretion in the value ascribed to the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred (which represents value attributable to holders of the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred rather than common stock) affected the Company's net income (loss) by $-0- and $(25,527) to arrive at net loss applicable to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Series A Preferred was converted to common stock on December 30, 2013 and the Series B Preferred was converted to common stock on February 28, 2014, which eliminated the 6% cumulative dividend accrued in 2015 compared to 2014.\nTable 57: <table><tr><td>21 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nThe Company had no revenues in either 2015 or 2014. It focused solely on the exploration, development and financing of the Nicaraguan Concessions.\nProduction and Other Operating Expenses (income)\nThe Company had no production related operating expenses in either 2015 or 2014. The Company sold its investment in Infinity-Texas in July 2012, and developed oil and gas properties in the United States in 2015 and 2014.\nThe Company has no current or planned domestic exploration and development activities at this time. It is not actively working on any domestic property, focusing instead on the exploration, development and financing of the Nicaraguan Concessions.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation expenses of $192,148 for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased 82.3% from those in 2014, which were $1,087,103. The Company has had minimal resources to pay employees, consultants and other service providers. Therefore, it has issued stock options to compensate and motivate its officers, directors and other service providers in previous years that vest generally over a two year time period. The Company has not granted any stock options during 2015. The significant decrease in stock-based compensation expense during 2015 compared to 2014 is attributable to the full vesting of the November 2012 stock option grant in November 2014, which eliminated the related amortization during the year ended December 31, 2015 and the lower market price of the Company's common stock compared to the $30.00 per share exercise price on the date of the most recent stock option grant in January 2014, which is being amortized over two years. The significant decrease in the market price of the common stock compared to the $30.00 per share exercise price resulted in substantially less grant date fair value of the January 2014 option grant that decreased the overall amount amortized in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses of $478,726 for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $255,976, or 34.8%, from those in 2014, which were $734,702. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is attributable to an overall decrease in professional fees of $138,122 as the Company engaged in less legal activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the settlement of the Berge litigation in 2014 and the change in our stock transfer agent in early 2015 for cost containment purposes. We reduced our Nicaragua Concession expenses by $76,845 in 2015 compared to 2014 as we reduced our activities due to the overall difficult environment for all oil and gas development projects. Reductions in general and administrative expenses were also attributable to us attending fewer investor conferences or similar forums during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, which decreased such expenses by $41,009. The closing of the May 2015 Private Placement reduced the need to incur additional costs related to capital raising and investor relations activities during the first half of 2015 coupled with the poor investment climate for oil and gas companies during 2015.\nImpairment charge on oil and gas properties\nThe Company determined to fully reserve the previously capitalized oil and gas expenditures as of December 31, 2015 and record an impairment charge of $9,720,666 during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company believes this is a reasonable and necessary position based on the challenges it and the entire oil and gas industry currently faces.\nTable 59: <table><tr><td>22 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe current environment for oil and gas development projects, especially discoveries in otherwise undeveloped regions of the world, is very challenging given the depressed commodity prices for oil and gas products and the resulting industry-wide reduction in capital expenditure budgets for exploration and development projects. This may provide substantial impediments for the Company and its ability to obtain adequate financing to fund the exploration and development of its Nicaraguan projects. If the Company does not receive the funding anticipated under its May 2015 Private Placement, it must raise substantial amounts of debt and equity capital from other sources in the immediate future in order to fund: (1) the required letters of credit to the Nicaraguan Government; (2) the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block of the Nicaraguan Concessions during 2016; (3) the shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block of the Nicaraguan Concessions should it be unable to negotiate a waiver of such requirement from the Nicaraguan government (4) the payment of normal day-to-day operations and corporate overhead and (5) the payment of outstanding debt and other financial obligations as they become due. These are substantial operational and financial issues that must be successfully addressed during 2016 or the Company's ability to satisfy the conditions necessary to maintain its Nicaragua Concessions will be in significant doubt. Accordingly, the Company has determined that it would recognize a full impairment charge against its previously capitalized oil and gas properties.\nGain on sale of undeveloped leases\nThe Company sold its interests in certain undeveloped leases located in Colorado during the year ended December 31, 2014 for a net gain of $10,000. The Company has no remaining developed or undeveloped leases subsequent to such sale.\nGain on settlement of litigation\nTimothy Berge, who filed an action in the District Court, City and County of Denver Colorado number 09CV9566, was granted a default judgment on November 8, 2010 against the Company in the amount of $304,921 plus costs. Mr. Berge provided certain geological services to Infinity Oil and Gas of Texas, Inc. and claimed breach of contract for failure to pay amounts he alleged were due. The Company was unable to defend itself in this matter due to limited financial resources even though it believed that it had meritorious defenses. On May 27, 2014 the Company settled this litigation by the issuance of 10,000 shares of common stock and the payment of $10,000 cash. The Company had previously established a provision of $304,878 related to this litigation as an accrued liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The value of the 10,000 shares of common stock and $10,000 cash paid in settlement of this litigation totaled $125,000 resulting in a gain of $179,877, which was recorded in the statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2014. No similar transactions occurred during 2015.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense decreased from $3,498,808 for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $933,456 for the 2015. This significant decrease is attributable to the Company converting approximately $555,000 of its interest bearing debt to common stock during early 2015. The Company received loan proceeds of $450,000 from the senior convertible note issued in May 2015 and $85,000 from two other convertible notes issued in July 2015 all of which bear interest at 8% and remained outstanding at December 31, 2015. In previous years the Company issued short-term notes payable at various dates and extended them at their maturities by paying additional compensation to the lenders chiefly in the form of warrants. The fair value of the warrants issued to the note holders at the origination and extension dates of the short-term promissory notes was recorded as a discount on the related debt. Amortization of the value of the warrants and revenue sharing interests granted to the holders resulted in a substantial increase in the overall effective borrowing costs during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2015. Discount amortization represents a non-cash expense and totaled $778,279 and $3,317,672 of total interest expense recognized in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe Company's current financial condition has made traditional bank loans and customary financing terms unattainable; therefore, the Company may find it necessary to continue with these types of short-term borrowings with high effective interest rates.\nTable 61: <table><tr><td>23 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSenior Convertible Note Issuance Costs\nOn May 7, 2015, we completed the May 2015 Private Placement of a $12.0 million principal amount Convertible Note and a Warrant exercisable to purchase 1,800,000 shares of our common stock, $0.0001 par value. We elected to account for and record such note on a fair value basis. Accordingly, all related debt issuance expenses, which totaled $1,302,629 (including $1,071,201 representing the value of the warrant to purchase 240,000 shares of common stock issued to placement agent and $231,428 of other fees and expenses), was charged to non-operating expenses in May 2015. No similar transactions occurred during 2014.\nIssuance of Warrant Derivative in Connection with Senior Convertible Note\nThe Warrant issued in the May 2015 Private Placement contains various provisions that grant the holder ratchet and anti-dilution rights. Consequently, such Warrant is required to be treated on a liability basis at its estimated fair value and classified as a derivative liability in the accompanying financial statements. We recorded its origination date estimated fair value at $8,034,007 as a non-operating expense in the year ended December 31, 2015. The value of the Warrant to purchase 240,000 shares granted to the placement agent in the May 2015 Private Placement was included in senior convertible note issuance costs in the statement of operations as previously described.\nChange in Derivative Fair Value\nThe conversion feature of the promissory notes and the common stock purchase warrants issued in connection with short-term notes and the senior convertible note outstanding during 2015 and 2014 are treated as derivative instruments because the promissory notes and warrants contain ratchet and anti-dilution provisions. Accordingly, we adjusted the value of the outstanding derivative liabilities to their estimated fair value as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. The mark-to-market process resulted in a gain of $9,431,914 during the year ended December 31, 2015 and a gain of $1,376,311 during the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in the gain is primarily the result of the derivative warrant liabilities issued in connection with the senior convertible note on May 7, 2015 and the reduction in the closing market price of our common stock between the May 7, 2015 ($5.00 per share) issuance date and December 31, 2015 ($0.16 per share). Generally, the fair value of the derivative liability declines when the market value of the underlying common stock decreases when compared to the derivatives exercise price.\nChange in Fair Value of Convertible Note\nWe issued the Convertible Note in the May 2015 Private Placement and elected to account for and record the Convertible Note on a fair value basis. We received $450,000 of proceeds at the date of issuance and the fair market value of the Convertible Note was estimated to be $682,400 ($232,400 over the proceeds of the note) as of the issuance date and $265,929 ($49,071 less than the carrying amount of the note) at December 31, 2015. The net $49,071 change in fair market value of the Convertible Note is included in change in fair value of senior notes payable in the accompanying statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. No similar notes were outstanding during 2014.\nOther income\nOther income increased from $72,900 in for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $184,404 in 2015. Other income in both 2015 and 2014 is primarily related to the derecognition of certain liabilities due to the expiration of the statute of limitations on collection of such obligations of the Company.\nIncome Tax\nFor income tax purposes, the Company has net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $67,415,000 as of December 31, 2015, which expire from 2025 through 2030. The Company has provided a 100% valuation allowance against the resulting deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty of realizing the tax benefits from its net operating loss carry-forwards.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company realized net losses. The Company anticipates operating losses and additional tax losses for the foreseeable future and does not believe that utilization of its tax loss carryforward is more likely than not. Therefore, because of the uncertainty as to the ultimate utilization of the Company's loss carryforward, any deferred tax asset at December 31, 2015 that resulted from anticipated benefit from future utilization of such carryforward has been fully offset by a valuation allowance.\nTable 63: <table><tr><td>24 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet loss\nAs a result of the above, we reported a net loss of $10,996,243 and $3,681,525 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a deterioration of $7,314,718 (198.7%).\nLoss applicable to common shareholders\nThe Company issued Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred effective April 13, 2012. The 6% cumulative dividend accrued as well as the accretion in the value ascribed to the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred (which represents value attributable to holders of the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred rather than common stock) affected the Company's net loss by $-0- and $25,527 to arrive at net loss applicable to common shareholders for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Series A Preferred was converted to common stock on December 30, 2013 and the Series B Preferred was converted to common stock on February 28, 2014, which reduced the amount of the 6% cumulative dividend accrued in 2015 compared to 2014.\nBasic and Diluted Loss per Share\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common share equivalents included in the diluted computation represent shares issuable upon assumed exercise of stock options and warrants using the treasury stock and if converted\u201d method. For periods in which net losses from continuing operations are incurred, weighted average shares outstanding is the same for basic and diluted loss per share calculations, as the inclusion of common share equivalents would have an anti-dilutive effect.\nThe basic and diluted loss per share was $4.07 and $1.46 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for the reasons previously noted. All outstanding stock options and warrants to purchase common stock were considered antidilutive and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 because of the net loss reported for each period. Potential shares of common stock as of December 31, 2015 that have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share amounted to 2,868,721 shares, which included 2,457,271 outstanding warrants and 411,450 outstanding stock options.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources; Going Concern\nWe have had a history of losses. We financed our operations primarily through a line of credit with Amegy and Offshore Finance through February 28, 2012, when we entered into definitive agreements with Amegy and Off-Shore relating to outstanding debt and other obligations we owed to them. Effective April 13, 2012, we issued shares of common stock and Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred stock in satisfaction of all the outstanding Amegy and Off-Shore Finance debt, related accrued interest and other fees, and the Amegy Warrant. Although the conversion of Amegy and Offshore Finance debt to equity in 2012 relieved us of a considerable portion of our current liabilities, we continue to have a significant working capital deficit and to experience substantial liquidity issues. Amegy exchanged all of its shares of Series A Preferred, including accrued and unpaid dividends, for shares of common stock as of December 30, 2013 and Offshore Finance converted all of its shares of Series B Preferred, including accrued and unpaid dividends, into shares of common stock on February 28, 2014.\nDuring 2012 we borrowed $250,000 under a short-term credit facility with a related party. We issued an interest-bearing note and common stock purchase warrants in connection with the facility. During 2013 we borrowed approximately $1,825,000 on a short-term basis by issuing various subordinated promissory notes with detachable warrants to purchase common shares. The fair value of the warrants resulted in a substantial increase in the overall effective borrowing costs. We used the proceeds of these notes to repay previously issued notes, including the foregoing related party note, to meet obligations and conduct seismic mapping related to our Nicaraguan Concessions and to provide working capital.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td>25 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn April 2013, we conducted a private placement of units composed of common stock and warrants under which we raised $890,000 in proceeds and exchanged $125,000 principal amount of an outstanding note plus accrued interest for units. We used part of these proceeds to retire notes issued earlier in 2013.\nWe were unable to raise long-term capital in 2014 to pay the majority of the outstanding short-term promissory notes on their respective maturity dates. We were able to negotiate extensions of the maturity dates on these short-term promissory notes by issuing additional warrants exercisable to purchase shares of common stock and, in one case, granting a revenue sharing interest in our Nicaraguan Concessions.\nIn the first quarter 2015, we were able to increase our line-of-credit to a maximum of $100,000, which provided us some liquidity, but were unable to obtain other sources of capital. On February 28, 2015, the short-term note holders of maturing debt exercised their right to convert principal balances totaling $475,000 and accrued interest totaling $28,630 into 100,726 shares of common stock at an exchange rate of $5.00 per share. In addition on March 31, 2015, the lender who provides the line-of-credit facility converted a partial principal balance totaling $50,000 into 10,000 shares of common stock at a price of $5.00 per share. These debt to equity conversions helped to reduce our near term cash needs.\nIn July 2015, the Company issued two promissory notes for total cash proceeds of $85,000. The promissory notes have maturity dates in October 2015. In connection with the notes, the Company issued warrants exercisable to purchase 8,500 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $5.60 per share. The warrants are immediately exercisable and terminate five years from their dates of issuance. In October 2015, we negotiated extensions of these two promissory notes to January 2016 and later to May 2016. In connection with extension of the notes, the Company issued warrants exercisable to purchase 8,500 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $5.60 per share. The warrants are immediately exercisable and terminate five years from their dates of issuance.\nOn December 27, 2013 the Company borrowed $1,050,000 under the December 2013 Note, which is an unsecured credit facility with a private, third-party lender. Effective April 7, 2015 the Company and the lender agreed to extend the maturity date of the December 2013 Note from April 7, 2015 to the earlier of (i) April 7, 2016 or (ii) the payment in full of the Investor Note issued in the May 2015 Private Placement in the principal amount of $9,550,000 (the New Maturity Date\u201d). All other terms of the Note remain the same and the remaining principal balance was reduced to $1,000,000 as of December 31, 2015 after the $50,000 principal repayment required by the extension agreement.\nThe December 2013 Note may be prepaid without penalty at any time. The December 2013 Note is subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness, as such terms are defined in the December 2013 Note. The parties are negotiating an extension of the December 2013 Note which, if completed, will extend the maturity to April 7, 2017.\nOn May 7, 2015 the Company completed the May 2015 Private Placement of $12.0 million Convertible Note and a Warrant exercisable to purchase 1,800,000 shares of the Company's common stock with an institutional investor. At the closing of the May 2015 Private Placement, the investor acquired the Convertible Note by paying $450,000 in cash and issuing the Investor Note, secured by cash, with a principal amount of $9,550,000. Assuming all amounts payable to the Company under the Investor Note are paid, the May 2015 Private Placement will result in gross proceeds of $10.0 million before placement agent fees and other expenses associated with the transaction, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Company used the initial proceeds from the closing to retire certain outstanding obligations, including the 2015 area and training fees of approximately $155,000 owed to the Nicaraguan government relating to its Nicaragua Concessions, and to provide additional working capital.\nThe Company will receive the remaining cash proceeds upon each voluntary or mandatory prepayment of the Investor Note. The investor may, at its option and at any time, voluntarily prepay the Investor Note, in whole or in part.\nThe Convertible Note matures on the three-year anniversary of its issuance, bears interest at 8% per annum, and is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into shares of the Company's common stock at $5.00 per share (the Conversion Price\u201d). As a part of the May 2015 Private Placement, the Company issued a Warrant to the investor giving it the right to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,800,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share. The Warrant is exercisable commencing six months from the date of issuance for a period of seven years from the date of issuance.\nTable 67: <table><tr><td>26 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe investor has no right to convert the Convertible Note or exercise the Warrant to the extent that such conversion or exercise would result in the investor being the beneficial owner of in excess of 9.99% of the Company's common stock. The Convertible Note ranks senior to the Company's existing and future indebtedness and is secured by all of the assets of the Company, excluding the Nicaraguan Concessions.\nWestPark Capital acted as placement agent for the Company in the May 2015 Private Placement and received a fee of 6% of cash proceeds, or $600,000, if and when the Company receives the full cash proceeds. It received $27,000 of such amount at the closing plus the reimbursement of legal fees totaling $7,500. The Company also issued WestPark a warrant exercisable to purchase 240,000 shares of common stock at a price of $5.00 per share. The warrant was exercisable upon from the date of issuance for a period of seven years.\nIn summary, as of December 31, 2015, we owed $68,303 on our line-of-credit, which is due February 28, 2016, the two promissory notes in the total principal amount of $85,000 which is due in January 2016 and the December 2013 Note in the principal amount of $1,000,000 that is due on the earlier of (i) April 7, 2016 or (ii) the payment in full of the Investor Note issued in the May 2015 Private Placement in the principal amount of $9,550,000. We intend to seek additional short-term debt financing to provide the funds necessary to pay-off the line-of-credit when it comes due and to provide working capital to fund normal operations, although we can provide no assurances that we will be successful in this regard. Our current financial condition has made traditional bank loans and normal financing terms unattainable; therefore, we may find it necessary to continue with these types of short-term borrowings with high effective interest rates.\nThe Company is in Sub-Period 3 of the exploration phase of the 30-year Concession for both Perlas and Tyra as of June 30, 2015. Sub-Period 3 of the Nicaraguan Concessions requires the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block during 2016 and the shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block. The Company is in process of identifying at least one potential drilling site on the Perlas Block as required in Sub-Period 3 and will have to perform supplemental EIA work prior to requesting and receiving the permit to drill from the Nicaraguan government. The work plan on the Tyra block for Sub-Period 3 requires the Company to shoot additional seismic, which is estimated to cost approximately $2,500,000 prior to the commencement of exploratory drilling. The Company is negotiating with the Nicaraguan government to seek a waiver of the additional seismic mapping on the Tyra Block so that it can proceed with exploratory drilling. There can be no assurance whether it will be able to obtain a waiver of the requirement.\nIn accordance with the Nicaraguan Concession agreements, the Company has previously provided the Ministry of Energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts of $443,100 for Perlas (expired March 2014) and $408,450 for Tyra (expired September 2014). The Company has also made all required expenditures related to the Nicaraguan Concessions for training programs and as area fees,\u201d for each respective year for 2010 through 2015. In accordance with the Nicaraguan Concession agreements, the Company must provide the Ministry of Energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts which total $1,356,227 for the Perlas block and $278,450 for the Tyra block for exploration requirements on the leases as required by the Nicaraguan Concessions, to replace the expired letters of credit. The minimum cash requirements to maintain and comply with the minimum work program as defined in the Nicaraguan Concessions for the next twelve month period will be approximately $5,500,000 for the Perlas Block which includes all costs to prepare for and drill the initial exploratory well, and $280,000 for the Tyra Block, assuming the waiver is granted regarding the seismic mapping. If such waiver is not granted, the Company estimates it will require approximately $2,500,000 for the seismic mapping. Finally, the Company estimates it will need approximately $300,000 to prepare and submit an environmental supplement to the Nicaraguan government to identify and receive authorization to drill up to five wells in the Concessions.\nThe Company has identified multiple sites for exploratory drilling and is planning the initial exploratory wells in order to determine the existence of commercial hydrocarbon reserves, subject to receipt from the Nicaraguan government of authorizations for the drilling of up to five wells. In order to meet its obligations under the Perlas Block of the Nicaraguan Concession, the Company has until approximately May 2016 to drill its initial exploratory well or risk being in default and losing its rights under the Nicaraguan Concessions.\nTable 69: <table><tr><td>27 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are negotiating the renewal and/or adjustment of the required letters of credit with the Nicaraguan Government. Further, we intend to seek a waiver of the 3-D seismic mapping requirement because we do not believe it will be effective in providing additional information due the supplemental water depth and other factors. We plan to prepare the necessary information to submit to the EIA in order to obtain the necessary authorizations to drill up to five locations in the Concessions. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in any of the foregoing regards. Except for the foregoing items, we believe we are in full compliance with the terms of the Nicaraguan Concessions agreements.\nThe Company must successfully comply with the restrictions related to the senior convertible note in order to release the remaining $9.45 million in funding under the Investor Note or it must raise substantial amounts of debt and equity capital in the immediate future in order to fund: (1) the required letters of credit to the Nicaraguan Government; (2) fund approximately $300,000 to prepare and submit an environmental supplement to the Nicaraguan government to identify and receive authorization to drill up to five wells in the Concessions; (3) the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block of the Nicaraguan Concessions during 2016; (4) the shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block of the Nicaraguan Concessions if it is unable to negotiate a waiver of such requirement form the Nicaraguan government; (5) the payment of normal day-to-day operations and corporate overhead; and (6) the payment of outstanding debt and financial obligations as they become due. These are substantial operational and financial issues that must be successfully addressed during 2016 or the Company's ability to satisfy the conditions necessary to maintain its Nicaragua Concessions will be in significant doubt. The Company is actively seeking new outside sources of debt and equity capital in order fund the substantial needs enumerated above, however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such capital or obtain it on favorable terms or within the timeframe necessary to cure the technical defaults existing on the Nicaraguan Concessions or to meet its ongoing requirements to drill the exploratory wells.\nIn addition to the minimum cash requirements related to the Nicaraguan Concessions, we estimate that we will require approximately $330,000 of working capital to maintain corporate operations for the next 12 months, but not including approximately $1,000,000 principal amount of a short-term promissory note due in April 2016, plus accrued interest, the $85,000 principal due on the two promissory notes due in January 2016 and the $68,303 currently outstanding under a revolving line of credit due February 2016. We owe $4,945,000 in trade payables related to seismic activities already performed (in December 2013) but not yet paid; however, we believe such party has agreed to extend the time for payment of this obligation to until such time as we begin drilling operations on the Nicaraguan Concessions. We also owe other obligations to third parties as noted on our balance sheet, which intend to pay, negotiate and settle when prior to beginning any drilling operations, although there is no assurance that will be able negotiate settlements with venders or avoid collection activities.\nWe plan to raise long-term capital to satisfy the foregoing needs through an offering of our equity or debt securities and/or through a commercial relationship with other industry operators, which may involve the granting of revenue or other interests in the Nicaraguan Concessions in exchange for cash and a carried interest in exploration and development operations or the creation of a joint venture or other strategic partnership. There can be no assurance that we will obtain such funding or obtain it on terms acceptable to us. Further, if we cannot meet our obligations respecting the Nicaraguan Concessions, we may lose our rights to them.\nThe Company is doubtful that it be able to meet the Nicaraguan concession requirements and proceed to drilling the required exploration wells during 2016 given the current state of the oil and gas commodity markets and the challenging economics for any new exploration and development project especially a project in an area of the world without historical proven reserves of commercial hydrocarbons. The Company believes that it will be able to negotiate extensions with the Nicaraguan government relative to the required date by which an exploratory well must be drilled however there can be no assurance in this regard. These remain as substantial operational and legal issues that the Company must resolve in order to maintain its rights under the Nicaraguan Concessions during 2016.\nDue to the uncertainties related to these matters, there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nTable 71: <table><tr><td>28 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We believe certain critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in the notes to our financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements\u201d, of this annual report.\nThe application of our accounting policies regarding full cost accounting for oil and gas properties (Note 9), accounting for the issuance and valuation of derivative liabilities (Note 2, 3 and 7), accounting for deferred tax assets (Note 10) and estimates involving our stock-based compensation, are considered critical accounting estimates made in 2015 and 2014 (Note 6).\nOil and Gas Properties - The Company follows the full cost method of accounting for exploration and development activities and capitalizes direct costs, overhead costs and interest related to such activities. All of the Company's investment in such costs at December 31, 2015 and 2014 relate to unproved properties that relate to the Nicaraguan Concessions. Management must assess at least annually to ascertain whether impairment of the recorded values has occurred, which involves evaluation of estimates of lease terms for the properties; geographic and geologic data obtained, and estimated future net revenues. For the Nicaraguan Concessions this involves considering terms of the Concessions, status of ongoing environmental study, evaluation of seismic data, and plans to seek industry participation in future exploration and development.\nManagement is doubtful that it be able to meet the Nicaraguan concession requirements and proceed to drilling the required exploration wells during 2016 given the current state of the oil and gas commodity markets and the challenging economics for any new exploration and development project especially a project in an area of the world without historical proven reserves of commercial hydrocarbons. Management believes that it will be able to negotiate extensions with the Nicaraguan government relative to the required date by which an exploratory well must be drilled however there can be no assurance in this regard. These remain as substantial operational and legal issues that the Company must mitigate and resolve in order to maintain its rights under the Nicaraguan concessions during 2016.\nManagement determined to fully reserve the previously capitalized oil and gas expenditures as of December 31, 2015 and record an impairment charge of $9,720,666 during the year ended December 31, 2015. Management believes this is a reasonable and necessary position based on the challenges currently faced by the Company and generally by the entire oil and gas industry.\nDerivative liabilities - The estimated fair value of the Company's derivative liabilities, all of which are related to the conversion features and detachable warrants issued in connection with notes payable and Senior convertible note payable, were estimated using a closed-ended option pricing model utilizing assumptions related to the contractual term of the instruments, estimated volatility of the price of the Company's common stock, interest rates, the probability of both the downward adjustment of the exercise price and the upward adjustment to the number of warrants as provided by the note payable and warrant agreement terms (Note 2,3 and 7) and non-performance risk factors, among other items (ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements ( ASC 820\u201d) fair value hierarchy Level 3). When the note payable is extinguished, the derivative liability will be adjusted to fair value and the resulting derivative liability will be transitioned from a liability to equity as of such date.\nOther notes payable with a total principal balance of $475,000 ($503,630 including accrued interest) were extinguished during the year ended December 31, 2015 which caused the associated warrant derivative liability to be transitioned to equity at its fair value on the date of extinguishment. The warrant derivative liabilities transitioned to equity aggregated $329,849 during the year ended December 31, 2015 which represented their respective fair value as of the date of the extinguishment of their underlying note payable. None of the notes payable was extinguished during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTable 73: <table><tr><td>29 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe assumptions used for determining the fair value of derivative liabilities outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are reflected in Notes 2, 3 and 7 to the Financial Statements.\nDeferred income taxes - Accounting for income taxes requires significant estimates and judgments on the part of management. Such estimates and judgments include, but are not limited to, the effective tax rate anticipated to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future, the sufficiency of taxable income in future periods to realize the benefits of net deferred tax assets and net operating losses currently recorded and the likelihood that tax positions taken in tax returns will be sustained on audit.\nAs required by authoritative guidance, we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Authoritative guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2014, cumulative valuation allowances in the amount of $25,788,000 were recorded in connection with the net deferred income tax assets. Based on a review of our deferred tax assets and recent operating performance, we determined that our valuation allowance should be increased to $29,972,000 to fully reserve our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015. We determined that it was appropriate to continue to provide a full valuation reserve on our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015 because of the overall net operating loss carryforwards available and our history of operating and tax losses. We expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance until we determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets. To the extent we determine that the realization of some or all of these benefits is more likely than not based upon expected future taxable income, a portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed. Such a reversal would be recorded as an income tax benefit and, for some portion related to deductions for stock option exercises, an increase in shareholders' equity.\nAs required by authoritative guidance, we have performed a comprehensive review of our portfolio of uncertain tax positions in accordance with recognition standards established by the FASB, an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return, that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. We have no recorded liability as of December 31, 2015 representing uncertain tax positions.\nWe have generated substantial deferred income tax assets related to our operations primarily from the charge to compensation expense taken for stock options, certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards. For us to realize the income tax benefit of these assets, we must generate sufficient taxable income in future periods when such deductions are allowed for income tax purposes. In some cases where deferred taxes were the result of compensation expense recognized on stock options, our ability to realize the income tax benefit of these assets is also dependent on our share price increasing to a point where these options have intrinsic value at least equal to the grant date fair value and are exercised. In assessing whether a valuation allowance is needed in connection with our deferred income tax assets, we have evaluated our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to utilize the benefit of the deferred income tax assets. We continue to evaluate our ability to use recorded deferred income tax asset balances. If we fail to generate taxable income for financial reporting in future years, no additional tax benefit would be recognized for those losses, since we will not have accumulated enough positive evidence to support our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards in the future. Therefore, we may be required to increase our valuation allowance in future periods should our assumptions regarding the generation of future taxable income not be realized.\nFor income tax purposes, the Company has net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $67,415,000, which expire from 2025 through 2030. The Company has provided a 100% valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of realizing the tax benefits from its net deferred tax asset.\nStock options - We grant stock options to our employees and directors and such benefits provided are share-based payment awards, which require us to make significant estimates related to determining the value of our share-based compensation. Our expected stock-price volatility assumption is based on historical volatilities of the underlying stock obtained from public data sources. We granted options exercisable to purchase -0- and 90,000 shares during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The assumptions used for determining the grant-date fair value of options granted during the year ended December 31, 2014 are reflected in Note 6 to the Financial Statements.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td>30 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf factors change and we develop different assumptions in future periods, the compensation expense that we record in the future may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period. There is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share-based compensation. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values of our share-based compensation. Certain share-based payment awards, such as employee stock options, may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements. Alternatively, values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements. Although the fair value of employee share-based awards is determined using an established option pricing model, that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer/willing seller market transaction.\nAs of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, there have been no material changes or updates to our critical accounting policies.\nInflation and Seasonality\nInflation has not materially affected us during the past fiscal year. We do not believe that our business is seasonal in nature.", "summary": "The report contains a Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, cautioning about forward-looking statements and emphasizing the uncertainty of achieving future results.

See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the Financial Statements for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOperational and Financial Objectives\nCorporate Activities\nThe Company holds a 100% interest in the Perlas Block (560,000 acres/2,268 km) and Tyra Block (826,000 acres/3,342 km) located in shallow waters offshore Nicaragua. The Company received notification of final approval of the EIA by the Nicaraguan government on April 13, 2013, which began Sub-Period 2 as defined in the Nicaraguan concessions. Therefore, the Company has progressed to Sub-Period 2 of the exploration phase of the 30-year Concession for both Perlas and Tyra as of December 31, 2014. In accordance with the Nicaraguan Concession agreements, the Company has provided the Ministry of Energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts of $443,100 for Perlas (expired March 2014) and $408,450 for Tyra (expired September 2014). The Company has also made all required expenditures related to the Nicaraguan Concessions for training programs and as area fees,\u201d for each respective year for 2010 through 2014. The Company is currently negotiating the renewal of the required letters of credit with the Nicaraguan Government and its lenders; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in that regard. The Company considers it is fully in compliance with the terms of the Nicaraguan Concessions agreements, except for the renewal of the expired letters of credit, and is in year three of the exploration phase of the 30-year Nicaraguan Concessions.\nDuring December 2013 and January 2014, we completed the 2-D and 3-D seismic survey activities in the area as required under both of the Nicaraguan Concessions at this point. We believe that the newly acquired 2-D and 3-D seismic data, together with the previously acquired reprocessed 2-D seismic, will help us to further evaluate the structures that were previously identified with 2-D seismic in the Eocene Zone. Our geological consultants have estimated that these Eocene structures may contain recoverable oil in place. In addition, the 3-D seismic should provide our first geological information regarding the potential for oil resources in the Cretaceous Zone, which we could not evaluate using less precise 2-D seismic mapping. The evaluation of the newly acquired seismic data is ongoing in order to determine the scope our exploration program.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations) or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have material current or future effect on financial conditions, changes in the financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or significant components of revenue or expenses.\n 19 \n \nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nResults of Operations\nOperational and Financial Objectives\nCorporate Activities\nWe hold a 100% working interest in any hydrocarbon deposits found under the Perlas Block (560,000 acres/2,268 km) and Tyra Block (826,000 acres/3,342 km) located in shallow waters offshore Nicaragua. The final approval of the EIA by the Nicaraguan government of our environment impact study on April 13, 2013, began Sub-Period 2 for both the Tyra and Perlas Blocks as defined in the Nicaraguan Concessions. We believe we have satisfied the acquisition, processing and interpretation of Seismic data required in Sub-Period 2 for both the Perlas and Tyra Blocks. Therefore, we are now in Sub-Period 3 of the exploration phase of the 30-year Concession for both Perlas and Tyra as of December 31, 2015. Sub-Period 3 of the Nicaraguan Concessions requires the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block during 2016 and the shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block. We are in process of identifying at least one potential drilling site on the Perlas block as required in Sub-Period 3 and will have to perform supplemental EIA work prior to requesting and receiving the permit to drill from the Nicaraguan government. The work plan on the Tyra block for Sub-Period 3 requires us to shoot additional seismic, which is estimated to cost approximately $2,500,000 prior to the commencement of exploratory drilling. We are negotiating with the Nicaraguan government to seek a waiver of such additional seismic mapping on the Tyra Block so that we can proceed with exploratory drilling. There can be no assurance whether we will be able to obtain such waiver of the requirement.\nDuring late December 2013, we completed the 2-D seismic survey activities in the area as required under both of the Nicaraguan Concessions at that point. We believe that the newly acquired 2-D seismic data, together with the previously acquired reprocessed 2-D seismic, helped us to further evaluate the structures that were previously identified with 2-D seismic in the Eocene Zone. Our geological consultants have estimated that these Eocene structures may contain recoverable hydrocarbons (principally oil) in place. In addition, the new 2-D seismic acquired in 2013 provided our first geological information regarding the potential for oil resources in the Cretaceous Zone, which we could not evaluate using less precise older 2-D seismic mapping. We have identified multiple promising sites on the Perlas Block for exploratory drilling and is planning the drilling of initial exploratory wells in order to determine the existence of commercial hydrocarbon reserves. We believe that we have performed all work necessary as of December 31, 2015 to proceed to Sub-Period 3 for the Perlas Block as defined in the Nicaraguan Concessions, which requires the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas concession within the following one-year period. We must first prepare and submit a supplemental EIA to the Nicaraguan government before the drilling permit can be issued on the Perlas Block.\nWe must prepare and submit the EIA supplement to the Nicaraguan Government, assuming that it does accept the supplemental EIA and grant the drilling permit, we will be required to drill at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block within one-year (estimated to be prior to May 2016) or risk being in default and losing its rights under the Nicaraguan Concessions. We do not believe that we will proceed to drilling the Nicaraguan Concessions during 2016 given the current state of the oil and gas commodity markets, financing the drilling, and the challenging economics for any new exploration and development project, especially a project in an area of the world without historical proven reserves of commercial hydrocarbons. We believe that we can negotiate extensions with the Nicaraguan government of the required date by which an exploratory well must be drilled; however, there can be no assurance in this regard.\nThe Company is in technical default of the Nicaraguan Concession because it has not provided the required letters of credit to the Nicaraguan Government. In accordance with the Nicaraguan Concession agreements, the Company had previously provided the Ministry of Energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts of $443,100 for Perlas (expired March 2014) and $408,450 for Tyra (expired September 2014). The Company had also made all required expenditures related to the Nicaraguan Concessions for training programs and as area fees,\u201d for each respective year for 2010 through 2015. The Company is currently negotiating the renewal and increase of the required letters of credit which total $1,356,227 for the Perlas block and $278,450 for the Tyra block with the Nicaraguan Government and its lenders; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in the regard. The Company considers it is fully in compliance with the terms of the Nicaraguan Concessions agreements, except for the renewal of the expired letters of credit.\n 20 \n \nWe are also seeking offers from industry operators and other third parties for interests in the acreage in the Nicaraguan Concessions in exchange for cash and a carried interest in exploration and development operations or other joint venture arrangement. Accordingly, we intend to finance our business strategy through external financing, which may include debt and equity capital raised in public and private offerings, joint ventures, sale of working or other interests, employment of working capital and cash flow from operations, if any, and net proceeds from the sales of assets.\nOur ability to complete these activities is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n \u25cf The availability of the capital resources required to fund the activities; \u25cf The availability of third party contractors for completion services; and \u25cf The approval by regulatory agencies of applications for permits to conduct exploration activities in a timely manner. \nWe do not expect that we will be able to meet the Nicaraguan Concession requirements and proceed to drilling the required exploration wells during 2016 given the current state of the oil and gas commodity markets, the availability of financing and the challenging economics for any new exploration and development project, especially a project in an area of the world without historical proven reserves of commercial hydrocarbons. We believe that we will be able to negotiate extensions with the Nicaraguan government of the required date by which an exploratory well must be drilled; however, there can be no assurance in this regard. These remain as substantial operational and legal issues that we must resolve in order to maintain our rights under the Nicaraguan Concessions during 2016.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations) or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have material current or future effect on financial conditions, changes in the financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or significant components of revenue or expenses.\nResults of Operations\nReverse Stock Split\nIn November 2015, we filed an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to effect a one-for-ten reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Our authorized shares and par value per share remain unchanged. All common stock share and per share information in the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted to reflect retrospective application of the reverse split, unless otherwise indicated. See Note 5- Common Stock\u201d to the Financial Statements for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 for additional information about the Reverse Split.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nThe Company incurred a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $10,996,243, or $4.07 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $3,707,052, or $1.46 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company issued Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred effective April 13, 2012. The 6% cumulative dividend accrued as well as the accretion in the value ascribed to the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred (which represents value attributable to holders of the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred rather than common stock) affected the Company's net income (loss) by $-0- and $(25,527) to arrive at net loss applicable to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Series A Preferred was converted to common stock on December 30, 2013 and the Series B Preferred was converted to common stock on February 28, 2014, which eliminated the 6% cumulative dividend accrued in 2015 compared to 2014.\n 21 \n \nRevenue\nThe Company had no revenues in either 2015 or 2014. It focused solely on the exploration, development and financing of the Nicaraguan Concessions.\nProduction and Other Operating Expenses (income)\nThe Company had no production related operating expenses in either 2015 or 2014. The Company sold its investment in Infinity-Texas in July 2012, and developed oil and gas properties in the United States in 2015 and 2014.\nThe Company has no current or planned domestic exploration and development activities at this time. It is not actively working on any domestic property, focusing instead on the exploration, development and financing of the Nicaraguan Concessions.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation expenses of $192,148 for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased 82.3% from those in 2014, which were $1,087,103. The Company has had minimal resources to pay employees, consultants and other service providers. Therefore, it has issued stock options to compensate and motivate its officers, directors and other service providers in previous years that vest generally over a two year time period. The Company has not granted any stock options during 2015. The significant decrease in stock-based compensation expense during 2015 compared to 2014 is attributable to the full vesting of the November 2012 stock option grant in November 2014, which eliminated the related amortization during the year ended December 31, 2015 and the lower market price of the Company's common stock compared to the $30.00 per share exercise price on the date of the most recent stock option grant in January 2014, which is being amortized over two years. The significant decrease in the market price of the common stock compared to the $30.00 per share exercise price resulted in substantially less grant date fair value of the January 2014 option grant that decreased the overall amount amortized in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses of $478,726 for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $255,976, or 34.8%, from those in 2014, which were $734,702. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is attributable to an overall decrease in professional fees of $138,122 as the Company engaged in less legal activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the settlement of the Berge litigation in 2014 and the change in our stock transfer agent in early 2015 for cost containment purposes. We reduced our Nicaragua Concession expenses by $76,845 in 2015 compared to 2014 as we reduced our activities due to the overall difficult environment for all oil and gas development projects. Reductions in general and administrative expenses were also attributable to us attending fewer investor conferences or similar forums during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, which decreased such expenses by $41,009. The closing of the May 2015 Private Placement reduced the need to incur additional costs related to capital raising and investor relations activities during the first half of 2015 coupled with the poor investment climate for oil and gas companies during 2015.\nImpairment charge on oil and gas properties\nThe Company determined to fully reserve the previously capitalized oil and gas expenditures as of December 31, 2015 and record an impairment charge of $9,720,666 during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company believes this is a reasonable and necessary position based on the challenges it and the entire oil and gas industry currently faces.\n 22 \n \nThe current environment for oil and gas development projects, especially discoveries in otherwise undeveloped regions of the world, is very challenging given the depressed commodity prices for oil and gas products and the resulting industry-wide reduction in capital expenditure budgets for exploration and development projects. This may provide substantial impediments for the Company and its ability to obtain adequate financing to fund the exploration and development of its Nicaraguan projects. If the Company does not receive the funding anticipated under its May 2015 Private Placement, it must raise substantial amounts of debt and equity capital from other sources in the immediate future in order to fund: (1) the required letters of credit to the Nicaraguan Government; (2) the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block of the Nicaraguan Concessions during 2016; (3) the shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block of the Nicaraguan Concessions should it be unable to negotiate a waiver of such requirement from the Nicaraguan government (4) the payment of normal day-to-day operations and corporate overhead and (5) the payment of outstanding debt and other financial obligations as they become due. These are substantial operational and financial issues that must be successfully addressed during 2016 or the Company's ability to satisfy the conditions necessary to maintain its Nicaragua Concessions will be in significant doubt. Accordingly, the Company has determined that it would recognize a full impairment charge against its previously capitalized oil and gas properties.\nGain on sale of undeveloped leases\nThe Company sold its interests in certain undeveloped leases located in Colorado during the year ended December 31, 2014 for a net gain of $10,000. The Company has no remaining developed or undeveloped leases subsequent to such sale.\nGain on settlement of litigation\nTimothy Berge, who filed an action in the District Court, City and County of Denver Colorado number 09CV9566, was granted a default judgment on November 8, 2010 against the Company in the amount of $304,921 plus costs. Mr. Berge provided certain geological services to Infinity Oil and Gas of Texas, Inc. and claimed breach of contract for failure to pay amounts he alleged were due. The Company was unable to defend itself in this matter due to limited financial resources even though it believed that it had meritorious defenses. On May 27, 2014 the Company settled this litigation by the issuance of 10,000 shares of common stock and the payment of $10,000 cash. The Company had previously established a provision of $304,878 related to this litigation as an accrued liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The value of the 10,000 shares of common stock and $10,000 cash paid in settlement of this litigation totaled $125,000 resulting in a gain of $179,877, which was recorded in the statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2014. No similar transactions occurred during 2015.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense decreased from $3,498,808 for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $933,456 for the 2015. This significant decrease is attributable to the Company converting approximately $555,000 of its interest bearing debt to common stock during early 2015. The Company received loan proceeds of $450,000 from the senior convertible note issued in May 2015 and $85,000 from two other convertible notes issued in July 2015 all of which bear interest at 8% and remained outstanding at December 31, 2015. In previous years the Company issued short-term notes payable at various dates and extended them at their maturities by paying additional compensation to the lenders chiefly in the form of warrants. The fair value of the warrants issued to the note holders at the origination and extension dates of the short-term promissory notes was recorded as a discount on the related debt. Amortization of the value of the warrants and revenue sharing interests granted to the holders resulted in a substantial increase in the overall effective borrowing costs during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2015. Discount amortization represents a non-cash expense and totaled $778,279 and $3,317,672 of total interest expense recognized in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe Company's current financial condition has made traditional bank loans and customary financing terms unattainable; therefore, the Company may find it necessary to continue with these types of short-term borrowings with high effective interest rates.\n 23 \n \nSenior Convertible Note Issuance Costs\nOn May 7, 2015, we completed the May 2015 Private Placement of a $12.0 million principal amount Convertible Note and a Warrant exercisable to purchase 1,800,000 shares of our common stock, $0.0001 par value. We elected to account for and record such note on a fair value basis. Accordingly, all related debt issuance expenses, which totaled $1,302,629 (including $1,071,201 representing the value of the warrant to purchase 240,000 shares of common stock issued to placement agent and $231,428 of other fees and expenses), was charged to non-operating expenses in May 2015. No similar transactions occurred during 2014.\nIssuance of Warrant Derivative in Connection with Senior Convertible Note\nThe Warrant issued in the May 2015 Private Placement contains various provisions that grant the holder ratchet and anti-dilution rights. Consequently, such Warrant is required to be treated on a liability basis at its estimated fair value and classified as a derivative liability in the accompanying financial statements. We recorded its origination date estimated fair value at $8,034,007 as a non-operating expense in the year ended December 31, 2015. The value of the Warrant to purchase 240,000 shares granted to the placement agent in the May 2015 Private Placement was included in senior convertible note issuance costs in the statement of operations as previously described.\nChange in Derivative Fair Value\nThe conversion feature of the promissory notes and the common stock purchase warrants issued in connection with short-term notes and the senior convertible note outstanding during 2015 and 2014 are treated as derivative instruments because the promissory notes and warrants contain ratchet and anti-dilution provisions. Accordingly, we adjusted the value of the outstanding derivative liabilities to their estimated fair value as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. The mark-to-market process resulted in a gain of $9,431,914 during the year ended December 31, 2015 and a gain of $1,376,311 during the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in the gain is primarily the result of the derivative warrant liabilities issued in connection with the senior convertible note on May 7, 2015 and the reduction in the closing market price of our common stock between the", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the Financial Statements for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOperational and Financial Objectives\nCorporate Activities\nThe Company holds a 100% interest in the Perlas Block (560,000 acres/2,268 km) and Tyra Block (826,000 acres/3,342 km) located in shallow waters offshore Nicaragua. The Company received notification of final approval of the EIA by the Nicaraguan government on April 13, 2013, which began Sub-Period 2 as defined in the Nicaraguan concessions. Therefore, the Company has progressed to Sub-Period 2 of the exploration phase of the 30-year Concession for both Perlas and Tyra as of December 31, 2014. In accordance with the Nicaraguan Concession agreements, the Company has provided the Ministry of Energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts of $443,100 for Perlas (expired March 2014) and $408,450 for Tyra (expired September 2014). The Company has also made all required expenditures related to the Nicaraguan Concessions for training programs and as area fees,\u201d for each respective year for 2010 through 2014. The Company is currently negotiating the renewal of the required letters of credit with the Nicaraguan Government and its lenders; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in that regard. The Company considers it is fully in compliance with the terms of the Nicaraguan Concessions agreements, except for the renewal of the expired letters of credit, and is in year three of the exploration phase of the 30-year Nicaraguan Concessions.\nDuring December 2013 and January 2014, we completed the 2-D and 3-D seismic survey activities in the area as required under both of the Nicaraguan Concessions at this point. We believe that the newly acquired 2-D and 3-D seismic data, together with the previously acquired reprocessed 2-D seismic, will help us to further evaluate the structures that were previously identified with 2-D seismic in the Eocene Zone. Our geological consultants have estimated that these Eocene structures may contain recoverable oil in place. In addition, the 3-D seismic should provide our first geological information regarding the potential for oil resources in the Cretaceous Zone, which we could not evaluate using less precise 2-D seismic mapping. The evaluation of the newly acquired seismic data is ongoing in order to determine the scope our exploration program.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations) or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have material current or future effect on financial conditions, changes in the financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or significant components of revenue or expenses.\n 19 \n \nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nResults of Operations\nOperational and Financial Objectives\nCorporate Activities\nWe hold a 100% working interest in any hydrocarbon deposits found under the Perlas Block (560,000 acres/2,268 km) and Tyra Block (826,000 acres/3,342 km) located in shallow waters offshore Nicaragua. The final approval of the EIA by the Nicaraguan government of our environment impact study on April 13, 2013, began Sub-Period 2 for both the Tyra and Perlas Blocks as defined in the Nicaraguan Concessions. We believe we have satisfied the acquisition, processing and interpretation of Seismic data required in Sub-Period 2 for both the Perlas and Tyra Blocks. Therefore, we are now in Sub-Period 3 of the exploration phase of the 30-year Concession for both Perlas and Tyra as of December 31, 2015. Sub-Period 3 of the Nicaraguan Concessions requires the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block during 2016 and the shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block. We are in process of identifying at least one potential drilling site on the Perlas block as required in Sub-Period 3 and will have to perform supplemental EIA work prior to requesting and receiving the permit to drill from the Nicaraguan government. The work plan on the Tyra block for Sub-Period 3 requires us to shoot additional seismic, which is estimated to cost approximately $2,500,000 prior to the commencement of exploratory drilling. We are negotiating with the Nicaraguan government to seek a waiver of such additional seismic mapping on the Tyra Block so that we can proceed with exploratory drilling. There can be no assurance whether we will be able to obtain such waiver of the requirement.\nDuring late December 2013, we completed the 2-D seismic survey activities in the area as required under both of the Nicaraguan Concessions at that point. We believe that the newly acquired 2-D seismic data, together with the previously acquired reprocessed 2-D seismic, helped us to further evaluate the structures that were previously identified with 2-D seismic in the Eocene Zone. Our geological consultants have estimated that these Eocene structures may contain recoverable hydrocarbons (principally oil) in place. In addition, the new 2-D seismic acquired in 2013 provided our first geological information regarding the potential for oil resources in the Cretaceous Zone, which we could not evaluate using less precise older 2-D seismic mapping. We have identified multiple promising sites on the Perlas Block for exploratory drilling and is planning the drilling of initial exploratory wells in order to determine the existence of commercial hydrocarbon reserves. We believe that we have performed all work necessary as of December 31, 2015 to proceed to Sub-Period 3 for the Perlas Block as defined in the Nicaraguan Concessions, which requires the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas concession within the following one-year period. We must first prepare and submit a supplemental EIA to the Nicaraguan government before the drilling permit can be issued on the Perlas Block.\nWe must prepare and submit the EIA supplement to the Nicaraguan Government, assuming that it does accept the supplemental EIA and grant the drilling permit, we will be required to drill at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block within one-year (estimated to be prior to May 2016) or risk being in default and losing its rights under the Nicaraguan Concessions. We do not believe that we will proceed to drilling the Nicaraguan Concessions during 2016 given the current state of the oil and gas commodity markets, financing the drilling, and the challenging economics for any new exploration and development project, especially a project in an area of the world without historical proven reserves of commercial hydrocarbons. We believe that we can negotiate extensions with the Nicaraguan government of the required date by which an exploratory well must be drilled; however, there can be no assurance in this regard.\nThe Company is in technical default of the Nicaraguan Concession because it has not provided the required letters of credit to the Nicaraguan Government. In accordance with the Nicaraguan Concession agreements, the Company had previously provided the Ministry of Energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts of $443,100 for Perlas (expired March 2014) and $408,450 for Tyra (expired September 2014). The Company had also made all required expenditures related to the Nicaraguan Concessions for training programs and as area fees,\u201d for each respective year for 2010 through 2015. The Company is currently negotiating the renewal and increase of the required letters of credit which total $1,356,227 for the Perlas block and $278,450 for the Tyra block with the Nicaraguan Government and its lenders; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in the regard. The Company considers it is fully in compliance with the terms of the Nicaraguan Concessions agreements, except for the renewal of the expired letters of credit.\n 20 \n \nWe are also seeking offers from industry operators and other third parties for interests in the acreage in the Nicaraguan Concessions in exchange for cash and a carried interest in exploration and development operations or other joint venture arrangement. Accordingly, we intend to finance our business strategy through external financing, which may include debt and equity capital raised in public and private offerings, joint ventures, sale of working or other interests, employment of working capital and cash flow from operations, if any, and net proceeds from the sales of assets.\nOur ability to complete these activities is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n \u25cf The availability of the capital resources required to fund the activities; \u25cf The availability of third party contractors for completion services; and \u25cf The approval by regulatory agencies of applications for permits to conduct exploration activities in a timely manner. \nWe do not expect that we will be able to meet the Nicaraguan Concession requirements and proceed to drilling the required exploration wells during 2016 given the current state of the oil and gas commodity markets, the availability of financing and the challenging economics for any new exploration and development project, especially a project in an area of the world without historical proven reserves of commercial hydrocarbons. We believe that we will be able to negotiate extensions with the Nicaraguan government of the required date by which an exploratory well must be drilled; however, there can be no assurance in this regard. These remain as substantial operational and legal issues that we must resolve in order to maintain our rights under the Nicaraguan Concessions during 2016.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations) or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have material current or future effect on financial conditions, changes in the financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or significant components of revenue or expenses.\nResults of Operations\nReverse Stock Split\nIn November 2015, we filed an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to effect a one-for-ten reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Our authorized shares and par value per share remain unchanged. All common stock share and per share information in the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted to reflect retrospective application of the reverse split, unless otherwise indicated. See Note 5- Common Stock\u201d to the Financial Statements for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 for additional information about the Reverse Split.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nThe Company incurred a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $10,996,243, or $4.07 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $3,707,052, or $1.46 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company issued Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred effective April 13, 2012. The 6% cumulative dividend accrued as well as the accretion in the value ascribed to the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred (which represents value attributable to holders of the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred rather than common stock) affected the Company's net income (loss) by $-0- and $(25,527) to arrive at net loss applicable to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Series A Preferred was converted to common stock on December 30, 2013 and the Series B Preferred was converted to common stock on February 28, 2014, which eliminated the 6% cumulative dividend accrued in 2015 compared to 2014.\n 21 \n \nRevenue\nThe Company had no revenues in either 2015 or 2014. It focused solely on the exploration, development and financing of the Nicaraguan Concessions.\nProduction and Other Operating Expenses (income)\nThe Company had no production related operating expenses in either 2015 or 2014. The Company sold its investment in Infinity-Texas in July 2012, and developed oil and gas properties in the United States in 2015 and 2014.\nThe Company has no current or planned domestic exploration and development activities at this time. It is not actively working on any domestic property, focusing instead on the exploration, development and financing of the Nicaraguan Concessions.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation expenses of $192,148 for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased 82.3% from those in 2014, which were $1,087,103. The Company has had minimal resources to pay employees, consultants and other service providers. Therefore, it has issued stock options to compensate and motivate its officers, directors and other service providers in previous years that vest generally over a two year time period. The Company has not granted any stock options during 2015. The significant decrease in stock-based compensation expense during 2015 compared to 2014 is attributable to the full vesting of the November 2012 stock option grant in November 2014, which eliminated the related amortization during the year ended December 31, 2015 and the lower market price of the Company's common stock compared to the $30.00 per share exercise price on the date of the most recent stock option grant in January 2014, which is being amortized over two years. The significant decrease in the market price of the common stock compared to the $30.00 per share exercise price resulted in substantially less grant date fair value of the January 2014 option grant that decreased the overall amount amortized in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses of $478,726 for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $255,976, or 34.8%, from those in 2014, which were $734,702. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is attributable to an overall decrease in professional fees of $138,122 as the Company engaged in less legal activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the settlement of the Berge litigation in 2014 and the change in our stock transfer agent in early 2015 for cost containment purposes. We reduced our Nicaragua Concession expenses by $76,845 in 2015 compared to 2014 as we reduced our activities due to the overall difficult environment for all oil and gas development projects. Reductions in general and administrative expenses were also attributable to us attending fewer investor conferences or similar forums during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, which decreased such expenses by $41,009. The closing of the May 2015 Private Placement reduced the need to incur additional costs related to capital raising and investor relations activities during the first half of 2015 coupled with the poor investment climate for oil and gas companies during 2015.\nImpairment charge on oil and gas properties\nThe Company determined to fully reserve the previously capitalized oil and gas expenditures as of December 31, 2015 and record an impairment charge of $9,720,666 during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company believes this is a reasonable and necessary position based on the challenges it and the entire oil and gas industry currently faces.\n 22 \n \nThe current environment for oil and gas development projects, especially discoveries in otherwise undeveloped regions of the world, is very challenging given the depressed commodity prices for oil and gas products and the resulting industry-wide reduction in capital expenditure budgets for exploration and development projects. This may provide substantial impediments for the Company and its ability to obtain adequate financing to fund the exploration and development of its Nicaraguan projects. If the Company does not receive the funding anticipated under its May 2015 Private Placement, it must raise substantial amounts of debt and equity capital from other sources in the immediate future in order to fund: (1) the required letters of credit to the Nicaraguan Government; (2) the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block of the Nicaraguan Concessions during 2016; (3) the shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block of the Nicaraguan Concessions should it be unable to negotiate a waiver of such requirement from the Nicaraguan government (4) the payment of normal day-to-day operations and corporate overhead and (5) the payment of outstanding debt and other financial obligations as they become due. These are substantial operational and financial issues that must be successfully addressed during 2016 or the Company's ability to satisfy the conditions necessary to maintain its Nicaragua Concessions will be in significant doubt. Accordingly, the Company has determined that it would recognize a full impairment charge against its previously capitalized oil and gas properties.\nGain on sale of undeveloped leases\nThe Company sold its interests in certain undeveloped leases located in Colorado during the year ended December 31, 2014 for a net gain of $10,000. The Company has no remaining developed or undeveloped leases subsequent to such sale.\nGain on settlement of litigation\nTimothy Berge, who filed an action in the District Court, City and County of Denver Colorado number 09CV9566, was granted a default judgment on November 8, 2010 against the Company in the amount of $304,921 plus costs. Mr. Berge provided certain geological services to Infinity Oil and Gas of Texas, Inc. and claimed breach of contract for failure to pay amounts he alleged were due. The Company was unable to defend itself in this matter due to limited financial resources even though it believed that it had meritorious defenses. On May 27, 2014 the Company settled this litigation by the issuance of 10,000 shares of common stock and the payment of $10,000 cash. The Company had previously established a provision of $304,878 related to this litigation as an accrued liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The value of the 10,000 shares of common stock and $10,000 cash paid in settlement of this litigation totaled $125,000 resulting in a gain of $179,877, which was recorded in the statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2014. No similar transactions occurred during 2015.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense decreased from $3,498,808 for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $933,456 for the 2015. This significant decrease is attributable to the Company converting approximately $555,000 of its interest bearing debt to common stock during early 2015. The Company received loan proceeds of $450,000 from the senior convertible note issued in May 2015 and $85,000 from two other convertible notes issued in July 2015 all of which bear interest at 8% and remained outstanding at December 31, 2015. In previous years the Company issued short-term notes payable at various dates and extended them at their maturities by paying additional compensation to the lenders chiefly in the form of warrants. The fair value of the warrants issued to the note holders at the origination and extension dates of the short-term promissory notes was recorded as a discount on the related debt. Amortization of the value of the warrants and revenue sharing interests granted to the holders resulted in a substantial increase in the overall effective borrowing costs during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2015. Discount amortization represents a non-cash expense and totaled $778,279 and $3,317,672 of total interest expense recognized in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe Company's current financial condition has made traditional bank loans and customary financing terms unattainable; therefore, the Company may find it necessary to continue with these types of short-term borrowings with high effective interest rates.\n 23 \n \nSenior Convertible Note Issuance Costs\nOn May 7, 2015, we completed the May 2015 Private Placement of a $12.0 million principal amount Convertible Note and a Warrant exercisable to purchase 1,800,000 shares of our common stock, $0.0001 par value. We elected to account for and record such note on a fair value basis. Accordingly, all related debt issuance expenses, which totaled $1,302,629 (including $1,071,201 representing the value of the warrant to purchase 240,000 shares of common stock issued to placement agent and $231,428 of other fees and expenses), was charged to non-operating expenses in May 2015. No similar transactions occurred during 2014.\nIssuance of Warrant Derivative in Connection with Senior Convertible Note\nThe Warrant issued in the May 2015 Private Placement contains various provisions that grant the holder ratchet and anti-dilution rights. Consequently, such Warrant is required to be treated on a liability basis at its estimated fair value and classified as a derivative liability in the accompanying financial statements. We recorded its origination date estimated fair value at $8,034,007 as a non-operating expense in the year ended December 31, 2015. The value of the Warrant to purchase 240,000 shares granted to the placement agent in the May 2015 Private Placement was included in senior convertible note issuance costs in the statement of operations as previously described.\nChange in Derivative Fair Value\nThe conversion feature of the promissory notes and the common stock purchase warrants issued in connection with short-term notes and the senior convertible note outstanding during 2015 and 2014 are treated as derivative instruments because the promissory notes and warrants contain ratchet and anti-dilution provisions. Accordingly, we adjusted the value of the outstanding derivative liabilities to their estimated fair value as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. The mark-to-market process resulted in a gain of $9,431,914 during the year ended December 31, 2015 and a gain of $1,376,311 during the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in the gain is primarily the result of the derivative warrant liabilities issued in connection with the senior convertible note on May 7, 2015 and the reduction in the closing market price of our common stock between the"}
