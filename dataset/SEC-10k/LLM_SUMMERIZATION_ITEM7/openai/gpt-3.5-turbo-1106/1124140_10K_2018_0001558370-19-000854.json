Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nExact Sciences Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, Exact,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d or the Company\u201d) is a molecular diagnostics company focused on the early detection and prevention of some of the deadliest forms of cancer. We have developed an accurate, non-invasive, patient-friendly screening test called Cologuard\u00ae for the early detection of colorectal cancer and pre-cancer, and we are currently working on the development of additional tests for other types of cancer, with the goal of becoming a leader in cancer screening and diagnostics.\nOur Cologuard Test\nColorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. and the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. among non-smokers. Each year in the U.S. there are approximately:\nTable 95: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n146,000 new cases of colorectal cancer\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n51,000 deaths from colorectal cancer\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIt is widely accepted that colorectal cancer is among the most preventable, yet least prevented cancers. Colorectal cancer can take up to 10-15 years to progress from a pre-cancerous lesion to metastatic cancer and death. Patients who are diagnosed early in the progression of the disease-with pre-cancerous lesions or polyps or early-stage cancer-are more likely to have a complete recovery and to be treated less expensively. Of the more than 85 million people between the ages of 50 and 85, who are at average-risk for colorectal cancer in the U.S., 38 percent have not been screened according to current guidelines. Internal studies have shown that approximately 50% of Cologuard users were previously unscreened for colorectal cancer. Poor compliance with screening guidelines has meant that nearly two-thirds of colorectal cancer diagnoses are made in the disease's late stages. The five-year survival rates for stages 3 and 4 are 70 percent and 13 percent, respectively. We believe the large underserved population of unscreened and inadequately screened patients represents a significant opportunity for a patient-friendly screening test.\nOur Cologuard test is a non-invasive sDNA screening test that utilizes a multi-target approach to detect DNA and hemoglobin biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer and pre-cancer. Eleven biomarkers are targeted that have been shown to be strongly associated with colorectal cancer and pre-cancer. Methylation, mutation, and hemoglobin results are combined in the laboratory analysis through a proprietary algorithm to provide a single positive or negative reportable result.\nChanges in DNA methylation, and the occurrence of mutations, alter gene expression and other mechanisms for cell cycle regulation and differentiation. As a result, the affected cells continue to proliferate, often resulting in malignancies associated with colorectal cancer and pre-cancer. Hemoglobin is the protein complex responsible for transporting oxygen in red blood cells. During the progression of cancer, the probability of bleeding into the colon increases. The presence of hemoglobin, released from red blood cells, can be detected in the stool. Using sDNA Cologuard purifies, amplifies and detects increased levels of methylation, and presence of mutations, in specific genes. By combining these DNA indicators with a test for hemoglobin, Cologuard produces a multi-marker result effective for the detection of colorectal cancer and pre-cancerous adenomas.\nIn August 2014, the FDA granted PMA to Cologuard for use as a colorectal cancer screening test in adults 50 years of age and older who are at a typical average-risk for colorectal cancer. Upon approval, Cologuard became the first and only FDA-approved sDNA non-invasive colorectal cancer screening test. Our original PMA submission to the FDA for Cologuard included the results of our pivotal DeeP-C clinical trial that had over 10,000 patients enrolled at 90 sites in the U.S. and Canada. The results of our DeeP-C clinical trial for Cologuard were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in April 2014. The peer-reviewed study, Multi-target Stool DNA Testing for Colorectal-Cancer Screening,\u201d highlighted the performance of Cologuard in the trial population:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCancer Sensitivity: 92%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nStage I and II Cancer Sensitivity: 94%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nHigh-Grade Dysplasia Sensitivity: 69%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSpecificity: 87%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe the competitive advantages of sDNA screening may provide a significant market opportunity. There are 85 million people in the U.S. between the ages of 50-85 who are at average risk for colorectal cancer. At a three-year screening interval and an average revenue per test of $500 this represents a potential $14 billion market for Cologuard, of which our current share is approximately four percent.\nWe are also seeking to develop a pipeline of potential future products and services with a focus on liquid biopsy tests.\nOur Clinical Laboratory and Manufacturing Facilities\nAs part of our commercialization strategy, we established a state-of-the-art, highly automated lab facility that is certified pursuant to federal CLIA requirements to process Cologuard tests and provide patient results. Our commercial lab operation is housed in a 55,000 square foot facility in Madison, Wisconsin. At our lab, we currently have the capacity to process approximately three million tests per year.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017 we began construction of a new clinical lab facility in Madison, Wisconsin that is expected to be completed mid-2019. After the new clinical laboratory is operational, we expect our total lab capacity at both facilities will be approximately seven million tests per year by the end of 2019.\nWe currently manufacture the Cologuard test in a facility in Madison, Wisconsin. As we expand the commercialization of Cologuard, we believe it will be necessary to expand our manufacturing capacity. Accordingly, we are in the process of building an additional manufacturing facility which we expect to complete in 2019. We are committed to manufacturing and providing medical devices and related products that meet customer expectations and applicable regulatory requirements. We adhere to manufacturing and safety standards required by federal, state, and local laws and regulations and operate our manufacturing facilities under a quality management system. We purchase certain components for our Cologuard test from third-party suppliers and manufacturers.\nHow We Recognize Revenue\nWe recognize revenue on the delivery of a test result to an ordering healthcare provider for tests performed where based on our estimate of the amount that we will ultimately collect at the time delivery is complete. The amount of revenue we recognize is based on the established billing rates less contractual and other adjustments, which yields the constrained amount that we expect to ultimately collect. We determine the amount we expect to ultimately collect on a per-payer or per-agreement basis, using historical collections, established reimbursement rates and other adjustments. The expected amount is typically lower than, if applicable, the agreed-upon reimbursement amount due to several factors, such as the amount of any patient co-payments, the existence of secondary payers and claim denials. Upon ultimate collection, the aggregate amount received from payers and patients where reimbursement was estimated is compared to previous collection estimates and, if necessary, the contractual allowance is adjusted. Finally, should we recognize revenue from claims on an accrual basis and later determine the judgments underlying estimated collections change, our financial results could be negatively impacted in future quarters. Historically, a portion of our revenue was recognized upon cash receipt, because we were unable to reasonably estimate the amount that would ultimately be collected from certain payers. Effective during the first quarter of 2017, we determined that we had the ability to reasonably estimate the amount that will ultimately be collected from all payers, including the impact of patient cost-share collections. Accordingly, as noted above, we now recognize revenue for all billed claims at the time the test results are delivered to the customer.\nOur average reimbursement per test, as further defined below, was approximately $476 and $438 through December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This cumulative average Cologuard reimbursement rate will change over time due to a number of factors, such as medical coverage decisions by payers, changes in the payer mix, the effects of contracts signed with payers, non-renewal or termination of payer contracts, changes in allowed amounts by payers, our ability to successfully win appeals for payment, settlements reached with payers regarding previously denied claims and our ability to collect cash payments from payers and individual patients. Historical average reimbursement is not necessarily indicative of future average reimbursement.\nWe calculate the average Cologuard reimbursement per test on a trailing twelve-month basis for all tests that are at least six months old, since it can take that long, or in some cases longer, to collect from some payers and patients. Thus, the average reimbursement per test at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, represents the total cash collected through such dates for tests performed during the twelve-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively, divided by the number of tests performed during those same periods.\nAcquisitions\nIn October 2018, we completed the acquisition of Biomatrica, a privately held company specializing in the collection and preservation of biological materials. In the acquisition, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests for an aggregate purchase price of $20.0 million net of cash received, debt repaid and certain other adjustments. Contingent consideration for an additional $20.0 million could be earned based upon certain revenue milestones being met.\n2019 Priorities\nOur top priorities for 2019 are to (1) power our partnership with Pfizer, (2) enhance Cologuard through label expansion and product improvements, and (3) advance liquid biopsy.\nPower the Partnership\nIn August 2018, we entered into a Promotion Agreement with Pfizer. Under the terms of the Promotion Agreement, Pfizer agreed to promote Cologuard and provide certain other sales and marketing services. We and Pfizer committed in the Promotion Agreement to invest specified amounts in the advertising and promotion of Cologuard. Pfizer has a large primary care sales team that has extensive experience with large health system organizations and enhances our physician and consumer marketing capabilities. A priority for 2019 is executing on the Pfizer partnership in order to grow the Cologuard brand and get more patients screened with Cologuard.\nEnhance Cologuard\nIn May 2018, the ACS updated its guidelines to recommend colorectal cancer screening beginning at age 45, rather than 50, for people at average risk of the disease due to the rising incidence rate within the 45-49 year-old population. There are nearly 21 million people who are between the ages of 45-49, and we estimate approximately 19 million of them are at average risk for colorectal cancer and would be eligible for screening under the ACS guidelines. We plan to conduct clinical and other necessary work to gain FDA approval to expand Cologuard's indication to people between the ages of 45 and 49 who are at average risk for colorectal cancer.\nIn addition, we are seeking opportunities to improve upon Cologuard's performance characteristics. For example, we are evaluating whether new biomarkers would increase specificity while maintaining sensitivity. If we could increase the specificity of Cologuard, we believe that would enhance its adoption as a front-line screening test. We are also evaluating ways that we might make Cologuard even easier for patients to use and opportunities for lowering the cost of providing Cologuard.\nThe timing of any expansion of Cologuard's indication or of any such enhancements to Cologuard is unknown and would be subject to FDA approval.\nAdvance Liquid Biopsy\nWe also are focusing our research and development efforts on building a pipeline of potential future products and services with a focus on liquid biopsy tests. We will continue to advance liquid biopsy through biomarker discovery and validation in tissue and blood. We have identified proprietary biomarkers for several cancers, including liver cancer and lung cancer. We have successfully performed validation studies on tissue samples for thirteen cancers and on blood samples for eight cancers.\nThe ACS estimates that liver cancer will be diagnosed in 42,000 Americans and cause 32,000 deaths in 2019, three-fourths of which will be hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC\u201d). Incidence and mortality rates are both increasing at approximately 3 percent per year. People who have been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver or Hepatitis B are at high\nrisk of developing HCC. Evidence shows that HCC testing in these high-risk groups leads to earlier detection and improved outcomes. The NCCN and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases ( AASLD\u201d) guidelines recommend that these two groups be tested for HCC every six months using ultrasound and the blood-based biomarker alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP\u201d). However, ultrasound and AFP are documented to have poor sensitivity for early stage cancer, which is the primary target of testing. We are currently seeking to develop a blood-based biomarker test to serve as an alternative to ultrasound and AFP for use in HCC testing, and our goal is to develop a patient-friendly test that performs better than this current standard of care. We are currently enrolling a case control study of at least 1,500 patients to finalize the development of our liver cancer test.\nThe ACS estimates that, in the U.S. in 2019, lung cancer will be diagnosed in 228,000 people and cause 143,000 deaths. Currently, more than half of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage, after symptoms appear, when the five-year survival rate is in the low single digits. We are currently seeking to develop a blood-based biomarker test to aid in the early detection of lung cancer in individuals with lung nodules discovered through a CT or other scan. Such a test may help reduce the number of follow-up procedures, and thereby reduce costs and improve health outcomes.\nResults of Operations\nOur top priorities for 2018 were to (1) continue to strengthen our core Cologuard business by increasing the size of our nationwide sale force, (2) prepare for future demand including by continuing to invest in people, processes, technology and systems to build capacity, and (3) expand our product pipeline by developing additional cancer screening and diagnostic tests.\nDuring 2018, we completed approximately 934,000 Cologuard tests, and generated $454.5 million of revenue compared to 2017 when we completed 571,000 tests and generated $266.0 million of revenue. We believe that the increase in revenues and tests completed from the prior year was primarily driven by sales force execution, our patient advertising campaign, and the increase in commercial coverage for Cologuard. As of December 31, 2018, nearly 147,000 health care providers have ordered Cologuard compared to nearly 102,000 health care providers as of December 31, 2017. In August 2018, we entered into a Promotion Agreement with Pfizer, Inc. Pfizer is promoting Cologuard to both physicians and health systems and will also actively participate in extending and deepening the Cologuard marketing campaign.\nDuring 2018, we made investments in our technical systems, manufacturing capabilities, customer care center, and our sales force in order to enhance our infrastructure and position our operations and processes for continued growth. Additionally, we continued to focus on cost containment throughout the business which, along with the increase in test volume, helped drive improvements in our gross margin from 70 percent for 2017 to 74 percent for 2018.\nIn 2018, we continued to invest in research and development and focused on the development of additional cancer diagnostic tests as outlined in the Advance Liquid Biopsy\u201d section above.\nIn order to support the commercialization of Cologuard and to achieve our goals for 2018, our selling, general, and administrative costs increased by $164.8 million during the year. In addition, our efforts in 2018 to develop our pipeline products and improvements to Cologuard led to an increase in research and development costs of $26.1 million during the year. We ensured that we were well capitalized to meet our future goals by raising $671.1 million and $225.3 million, net of issuance costs, through an underwritten public offering of convertible notes completed in January 2018 and June 2018, respectively, and finished the year with $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nRevenue. Our revenue is primarily generated by performing screening services using our Cologuard test. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we completed approximately 934,000 and 571,000 Cologuard tests, respectively, and generated revenue of $454.5 million and $266.0 million, respectively. The increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in completed Cologuard tests and an increase in average revenue recognized per test during the current period due to increased commercial insurance coverage for our Cologuard test.\nOur cost structure. Our selling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of non-research personnel salaries, office expenses, professional fees, sales and marketing expenses incurred in support of our commercialization efforts and non-cash stock-based compensation.\nCost of sales includes costs related to inventory production and usage, shipment of test collection kits, royalties and the cost of services to process tests and provide results to physicians. We incur expenses for tests in the period in which the activities occur, therefore, gross margin as a percentage of revenue may vary due to costs being incurred in one period that relate to revenues recognized in a later period.\nWe expect that gross margin for our services will continue to fluctuate and be affected by Cologuard test volume, our operating efficiencies, patient compliance rates, payer mix, the levels of reimbursement, and payment patterns of payers and patients.\nCost of sales. Cost of sales increased to $118.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $79.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cost of sales is primarily due to the increases in completed Cologuard tests. The Company completed approximately 934,000 and 571,000 Cologuard tests for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProduction costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n82.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n57.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n25.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFacility and support services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPersonnel expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther cost of sales expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal cost of sales expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n118.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n79.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n38.8\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses increased to $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $42.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Investment income increased to $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase in investment income was due to an increase in the average cash and marketable securities balance and an increase in the average rate of return on investments due to an increase in market interest rates for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.\nInterest expense. Net interest expense increased to $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We issued $690.0 million and $218.5 million of convertible debt in January 2018 and June 2018, respectively, which collectively resulted in $36.4 million in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2018. $28.6 million of interest expense relates to amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs for the year ended December 31, 2018. The remaining $7.8 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 relates to the stated interest that was paid in cash during the year. There was minimal interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the mortgage on one of our facilities in Madison, Wisconsin that was entered into in June 2015. The interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 is related solely to the mortgage on one of our facilities in Madison, Wisconsin that was entered into in June 2015.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue. Our revenue is generated by performing screening services using our Cologuard test. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company completed approximately 571,000 and 244,000 Cologuard tests, respectively, and generated revenue of $266.0 million and $99.4 million, respectively. The increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in completed Cologuard tests during the period.\nCost of sales. Cost of sales increased to $79.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $45.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cost of sales is primarily due to the increase in completed Cologuard tests. The company completed approximately 571,000 and 244,000 Cologuard tests for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProduction costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n57.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n30.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPersonnel expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFacility and support services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther cost of sales expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal cost of sales expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n79.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n45.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n34.0\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses.

Investment income increased to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase in investment income was due to a higher average balance and return on investments for the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016.\nInterest expense. Net interest expense of $0.2 million was realized for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Interest expense is related to the mortgage on one of our facilities in Madison, Wisconsin that was entered into in June 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our operations since inception primarily through public offerings of our common stock and convertible debt and through revenue generated by the sale of Cologuard. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $160.4 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and approximately $963.8 million in marketable securities.\nAll of our investments in marketable securities consist of fixed income investments, and all are deemed available-for-sale. The objectives of this portfolio are to provide liquidity and safety of principal while striving to achieve the highest rate of return. Our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $69.3 million, $71.7 million, and $130.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The principal use of cash in operating activities for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was to fund our net loss. The decrease in use of cash in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017 and 2016 is primarily due to increased Cologuard revenue and an increase in non-cash expenses such as amortization and stock-based compensation.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $781.9 million, $160.8 million, and $11.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017 and 2016 was primarily the result of the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities following our convertible debt offerings. Excluding the impact of purchases and maturities of marketable securities, net cash used in investing activities was $168.6 million, $75.2 million, and $14.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The increase in investing activities from 2017 to 2018, excluding the impact of purchases and maturities of marketable securities, was primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2018 from increased laboratory equipment purchases, computer equipment and computer software purchases, and assets under construction in order to continue to scale-up our operations for future expected growth of our Cologuard business. Additionally, the increase for 2018 was driven by the acquisition of Biomatrica for $17.9 million compared to 2017 when we completed an acquisition of Sampleminded, Inc. ( Sampleminded\u201d) for $3.0 million. The increase in investing activities from 2016 to 2017, excluding the impact of purchases and maturities of marketable securities was primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, the increase for 2017 was driven by the purchase of intangible assets for $20.7 million and the acquisition of Sampleminded for $3.0 million compared to 2016 when we had no activity in these areas.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $934.1 million, $261.0 million, and $149.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The increase in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017 was primarily the result of proceeds from our offerings of convertible debt in January 2018 and June 2018. The increase in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily the result of an increase in proceeds from the sale of common stock from $144.2 million in 2016 to $253.4 million in 2017.\nWe expect that cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at December 31, 2018 will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least the next twelve months, based on current operating plans. However, we may need to raise additional capital to fully fund our current strategic plan, which includes successfully commercializing Cologuard and developing a pipeline of future products. Additionally, we may enter into transactions to acquire other businesses, products, services, or technologies as part of our strategic plan. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funds to enable us to fund our operations through the completion of such plan, our results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected, and we may be required to delay the implementation of our plan and otherwise scale back our operations. Even if we successfully raise sufficient funds to complete our plan, we cannot assure that our business will ever generate sufficient cash flow from operations to become profitable.\nThe following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations to make contractual future payments, such as pursuant to debt and lease agreements, as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore Than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOne Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConvertible notes(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n908,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n908,500\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n43,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,991\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther long-term liabilities(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease obligations(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n68,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n44,286\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,021,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n12,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n37,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n966,777\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1) Senior convertible notes were issued in January and June 2018 and are treated as a single series of securities with a maturity date of January 15, 2025.

See Note 7 and Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Operating Loss Carryforwards\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $937.4 million, $403.5 million, $78.0 million, respectively. We also had federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $17.4 million and $7.5 million, respectively. The net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2038, if not utilized. The Internal Revenue Code and applicable state laws impose substantial restrictions on a corporation's utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards if an ownership change is deemed to have occurred. Additionally, tax law limitations may result in our NOLs expiring before we have the ability to use them. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) of 2017 limit the deduction for NOLs to 80 percent of current year taxable income and provides for an indefinite carryover period for federal NOLs. Both provisions are applicable for losses arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. For these reasons, even if we attain profitability our ability to utilize our NOLs may be limited, potentially significantly so.\nA valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit, or that future deductibility is uncertain. In general, companies that have a history of operating losses are faced with a difficult burden of proof on their ability to generate sufficient future income in order to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets. We have recorded a valuation against our deferred tax assets based on our history of losses and current uncertainty as to timing of future taxable income. The deferred tax assets are still available for us to use in the future to offset taxable income, which would result in the recognition of tax benefit and a reduction to our effective tax rate.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, tax positions, and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we believe that the following accounting policies and judgments are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nRevenue Recognition.\nRevenue. Our revenue is primarily generated by performing screening services using our Cologuard test, and the service is completed upon delivery of a patient's test result to the ordering physician. We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d),\nwhich we adopted on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method, which we elected to apply to all contracts. Application of the modified retrospective method did not impact amounts previously reported by us, nor did it require a cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption, as our method of recognizing revenue under ASC 606 was analogous to the method utilized immediately prior to adoption. Accordingly, there is no need for us to disclose the amount by which each financial statement line item was affected as a result of applying the new standard and an explanation of significant changes.\nThe core principle of ASC 606 is that we recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize revenue from our Cologuard test in accordance with that core principle, and key aspects considered include the following:\nContracts\nOur customer is the patient. However, we do not enter into a formal reimbursement contract with a patient, as formal reimbursement contracts, including national coverage determination, are established with payers. Accordingly, we establish a contract with a patient in accordance with other customary business practices.\nTable 114: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nApproval of a contract is established via the order submitted by the patient's physician and the return of a sample by the patient.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWe are obligated to perform our laboratory services upon receipt of a sample from a patient, and the patient and/or applicable payer are obligated to reimburse us for services rendered based on the patient's insurance benefits.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayment terms are a function of a patient's existing insurance benefits, including the impact of coverage decisions with CMS and applicable reimbursement contracts established between us and payers, unless the patient is a self-pay patient, whereby we require payment from the patient prior to us shipping a collection kit to the patient.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOnce we deliver a patient's test result to the ordering physician, we are legally able to collect payment and bill an insurer and/or patient, depending on payer contract status or patient insurance benefit status.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOur consideration is deemed to be variable, and we consider collection of such consideration to be probable to the extent that it is unconstrained.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPerformance obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) to the customer. Our contracts have a single performance obligation, which is satisfied upon rendering of services, which culminates in the delivery of a patient's Cologuard test result to the ordering physician. The duration of time between sample receipt and delivery of a valid test result to the ordering physician is typically less than two weeks. Accordingly, we elect the practical expedient and therefore, we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations.\nTransaction price\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration that we expect to collect in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (for example, some sales taxes). The consideration expected from a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both.\nThe consideration derived from our contracts is deemed to be variable, though the variability is not explicitly stated in any contract. Rather, the implied variability is due to several factors, such as the amount of contractual adjustments, any patient co-payments, deductibles or compliance incentives, the existence of secondary payers and claim denials.\nWe estimate the amount of variable consideration using the expected value method, which represents the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts. When estimating the amount of variable consideration, the company considers several factors, such as historical collections experience, patient insurance eligibility and payer reimbursement contracts.\nWe limit the amount of variable consideration included in the transaction price to the unconstrained portion of such consideration. In other words, we recognize revenue up to the amount of variable consideration that is not subject to a\nsignificant reversal until additional information is obtained or the uncertainty associated with the additional payments or refunds is subsequently resolved. Differences between original estimates and subsequent revisions, including final settlements, represent changes in the estimate of variable consideration and are included in the period in which such revisions are made. Revenue recognized from changes in transaction prices was $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe monitor our estimates of transaction price to depict conditions that exist at each reporting date. If we subsequently determine that we will collect more consideration than we originally estimated for a contract with a patient, we will account for the change as an increase in the estimate of the transaction price (i.e., an upward revenue adjustment) in the period identified. Similarly, if we subsequently determine that the amount we expect to collect from a patient is less than we originally estimated, we will generally account for the change as a decrease in the estimate of the transaction price (i.e., a downward revenue adjustment), provided that such downward adjustment does not result in a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized.\nWhen we do not have significant historical experience or that experience has limited predictive value, the constraint over estimates of variable consideration may result in no revenue being recognized upon delivery of a patient's Cologuard test result to the ordering physician, with recognition generally occurring at the date of cash receipt. Since the first quarter of 2017, we determined that our historical experience has sufficient predictive value, such that there are no longer any contracts for which no revenue is recognized upon delivery of a Cologuard test result to an ordering physician under both legacy accounting principles, which were effective in 2017, and ASC 606, which was adopted in 2018 as discussed above. Of the revenue recognized in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, approximately $4.3 million relates to the one-time impact of certain payers meeting our revenue recognition criteria for accrual-basis revenue recognition beginning with the period ended March 31, 2017. Approximately $1.0 million of this one-time impact relates to tests completed in the prior year and for which our accrual revenue recognition criteria were not met until 2017.\nAllocate transaction price\nThe entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation contained in a contract with a patient.\nPoint in time recognition\nOur single performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time, and that point in time is defined as the date a patient's successful test result is delivered to the patient's ordering physician. We consider this date to be the time at which the patient obtains control of the promised Cologuard test service.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table presents our revenues disaggregated by revenue source for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively:\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMedicare Parts B & C\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n254,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n172,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n81,976\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n184,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n84,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16,017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,383\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n454,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n265,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n99,376\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContract Balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable and deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. Generally, billing occurs subsequent to delivery of a patient's test result to the ordering physician, resulting in an account receivable. However, we sometimes receive advance payment from a patient, particularly a self-pay patient, before a Cologuard test result is completed, resulting in deferred revenue. The deferred revenue balance is relieved upon delivery of the applicable patient's test result to the ordering physician. Changes in accounts receivable and deferred revenue were not materially impacted by any other factors.\nDeferred revenue balances are reported in other short-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and were $0.5 million and $0.2 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nRevenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of each period was $0.1 million and $44,000, respectively.\nPractical expedients\nWe do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component, as at contract inception we expect the collection cycle to be one year or less.\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses on our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe incur certain other costs that are incurred regardless of whether a contract is obtained. Such costs are primarily related to legal services and patient communications (e.g. compliance reminder letters). These costs are expensed as incurred and recorded within general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations.\nInventory. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value (net realizable value). We determine the cost of inventory using the first-in, first out method ( FIFO\u201d). We estimate the recoverability of inventory by reference to internal estimates of future demands and product life cycles, including expiration. We periodically analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to expected sale or has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value and record a charge to cost of sales for such inventory as appropriate. In addition, our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process. If certain batches or units of product no longer meet quality specifications or become obsolete due to expiration, we record a charge to cost of sales to write down such unmarketable inventory to its estimated realizable value.\nDirect and indirect manufacturing costs incurred during process validation and for other research and development activities, which are not permitted to be sold, have been expensed to research and development.\nStock-Based Compensation. In accordance with GAAP, all stock-based payments, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units, market measure-based awards and shares purchased under an employee stock purchase plan ( ESPP\u201d) (if certain parameters are not met), are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. The grant date fair value of market measure-based share-based compensation plans are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model. The following assumptions are used in determining fair value for stock options, restricted stock and ESPP shares:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7 Valuation and Recognition-The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of each market measure-based award is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model. The fair value of service-based awards for each restricted stock unit award is determined on the date of grant using the closing stock price on that day. The estimated fair value of these awards is recognized to expense using the straight-line method over the vesting period. For awards issued to non-employees, the measurement date is the date when the performance is complete or when the award vests, whichever is the earliest. Accordingly, non-employee awards are re-measured at each reporting period until the final measurement date. The fair value of the award is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period, generally the vesting period. The Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo pricing models utilize the following assumptions:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7 Expected Term-Expected term is based on our historical life data and is determined using the average of the vesting period and the contractual life of the stock options granted.

With the adoption of Update 2016-09, forfeiture estimates are no longer required, and the effects of actual forfeitures are recorded at the time they occur. The impact on the consolidated balance sheet was a cumulative-effect adjustment of $0.4 million, increasing opening accumulated deficit and additional paid-in capital.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe fair value of service-based awards for each restricted stock award and restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the closing stock price on that day. The fair value of market measure-based share-based compensation plans are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions noted above and as further described in Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTax Positions. A valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets is reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have incurred significant losses since our inception and due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of future taxable income, management has determined that a $209.9 million and $214.3 million valuation allowance at December 31, 2018 and 2017 is necessary to reduce the tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The change in valuation allowance for 2018 and 2017 was a decrease of $4.4 million and $45.8 million, respectively. Due to the existence of the valuation allowance, future changes in our unrecognized tax benefits will not impact our effective tax rate.\nConvertible Notes. We account for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash or equity upon conversion by separating the liability and equity components of the instruments in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. In January 2018 and June 2018, we issued $690.0 million and $218.5 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of 1.0% Convertible Notes with a maturity date of January 15, 2025 (the Notes\u201d). We determined the carrying amount of the liability component of the Notes by using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing a debt instrument, including market interest rates, credit standing, yield curves and volatilities. Determining the fair value of the debt component requires the use of accounting estimate and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are judgmental in nature and could have a significant impact on the determination of the debt component, and the associated non-cash interest expense.\nFor the January 2018 offering, we allocated $194.9 million to the equity component of the convertible debt instrument. That equity component is treated as a discount on the liability component of the Notes, which is amortized over the seven-year term of the Notes using the effective interest rate method. For the June 2018 offering, we allocated $73.0 million to the equity component of the convertible debt instrument. That equity component, less the $14.2 million premium, is treated as a discount on the liability component of the Notes, which is amortized over the remaining six-and-a-half-year term of the Notes using the effective interest rate method. In addition, debt issuance costs related to the Notes were $18.9 million and $7.4 million for the January 2018 and June 2018 offerings, respectively. We allocated the costs to the liability and equity components of the Notes based on their relative values. The debt issuance costs allocated to the liability component are being amortized over the life of the Notes as additional non-cash interest expense. The transaction costs allocated to the equity component are netted with the equity component of the convertible debt instrument in stockholders' equity.\nGoodwill. In 2017, we recognized goodwill of $2.0 million from the acquisition of Sampleminded. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized goodwill of $15.3 million from the acquisition of Biomatrica. We evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis or more frequently should an event or change in circumstance occur that indicates that the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value. There were no impairment losses for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. Refer to Note 2 and 14 for further discussion of the goodwill recorded.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2018. See Note 2 for additional discussion.\nIn January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( Update 2016-01\u201d). Update 2016-01 modifies how entities will have to measure equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial\nliabilities. Under the new guidance, entities will have to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income unless the investments qualify for the new practicality exception. A practicality exception will apply to those equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair value and do not qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair value under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements,\u201d and as such these investments may be measured at cost. Update 2016-01 will be effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018, and subsequent interim periods. Update 2016-01 was further amended in February 2018 by ASU No. 2018-03, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, ( Update 2018-03\u201d). Update 2018-03 clarifies certain aspects of the guidance issued in Update 2016-01. Public business entities with fiscal years beginning between December 15, 2017 and June 15, 2018, are not required to adopt these amendments until the interim period beginning after June 15, 2018. We adopted Update 2016-01 on January 1, 2018, and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), ( Update 2016-02\u201d) to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition of right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The most noteworthy change in the standard is the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under current U.S. GAAP. The standard requires disclosures to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.\nWe will adopt the standard on January 1, 2019 with initial application on the effective date as permitted under ASU No. 2018-11. We will recognize and measure leases existing at the initial application date of January 1, 2019 through a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded at the beginning of fiscal year 2019. We intend to elect the package of practical expedients and accordingly, we will not reassess the lease classification or whether expired or existing contracts contain leases under the new definition of a lease. Additionally, we will elect not to separate the lease components from the non-lease components for all classes of underlying assets. Our ability to adopt the new standards depends on system readiness, including software procured from a third-party provider. We remain on schedule and have implemented key system functionality to enable preparation of financial statements in accordance with the new standard.\nWe anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets; however, we do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations. We expect the most significant impact to be the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases. Adoption of the standard is expected to result in the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases of approximately $17.0 million to $18.0 million and $19.5 million to $20.5 million as of December 31, 2018, respectively. We are not party to any capital lease agreements as of December 31, 2018.\nBased on our analysis, the sale-lease back transaction detailed within Note 9, the buyer-lessor has not obtained control of the underlying asset as the present value of the lease payments is substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset. As such, the underlying asset and related financing obligation will continue to be included in our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption.\nAt December 31, 2018, we included $7.3 million as an asset under construction, including $2.1 million that is funded by the landlord, with a corresponding financing obligation related to a build-to-suit construction project. See Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Based on our analysis, upon adoption of Topic 842, we do not control the asset under construction and, as such, the asset and corresponding financing obligation will be de-recognized at adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019.\nIn August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, ( Update 2016-15\u201d). Current GAAP either is unclear or does not include specific guidance on the eight cash flow classification issues included in the amendments in Update 2016-15. The amendments are an improvement to GAAP because they provide guidance for each of the eight issues, thereby reducing the current and potential future diversity in practice. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2018, and it did not have an impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nIn October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, ( Update 2016-16\u201d). This amendment improves the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. We adopted this guidance on\nJanuary 1, 2018, and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash, ( Update 2016-18\u201d). Update 2016-18 provides guidance on the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2018, and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements, as we do not have restricted cash.\nIn May 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting, ( Update 2017-09\u201d). Update 2017-09 provides guidance on determining which changes to the terms and conditions of share-based payment awards require an entity to apply modification accounting under Topic 718. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2018, and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2018-07 (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, ( Update 2018-07\u201d). Update 2018-07 expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. An entity should apply the requirements of Topic 718 to nonemployee awards except for certain exemptions specified in the amendment. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within that fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than an entity's adoption of Topic 606. We will adopt this guidance on January 1, 2019, and we do not anticipate it will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2018-09, Codification Improvements, (\"Update 2018-09\"). Update 2018-09 provided various minor codification updates and improvements to address comments that the FASB had received regarding unclear or vague accounting guidance. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within that fiscal year. We will adopt this guidance on January 1, 2019, and we do not anticipate it will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820); Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, (\"Update 2018-13\"). Update 2018-13 provided an update to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements under the scope of ASC 820. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software, ( Update 2018-15\u201d). Update 2018-15 provided guidance for evaluating the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808), ( Update 2018-18\u201d). Update 2018-18 provided additional guidance regarding the interaction between Topic 808 on Collaborative Arrangements and Topic 606 on Revenue Recognition. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of the financial condition and operations of Exact Sciences Corporation, focusing on the development and commercialization of Cologuard, a non-invasive screening test for colorectal cancer.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nExact Sciences Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, Exact,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d or the Company\u201d) is a molecular diagnostics company focused on the early detection and prevention of some of the deadliest forms of cancer. We have developed an accurate, non-invasive, patient-friendly screening test called Cologuard\u00ae for the early detection of colorectal cancer and pre-cancer, and we are currently working on the development of additional tests for other types of cancer, with the goal of becoming a leader in cancer screening and diagnostics.\nOur Cologuard Test\nColorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. and the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. among non-smokers. Each year in the U.S. there are approximately:\n \u00b7 146,000 new cases of colorectal cancer \n \u00b7 51,000 deaths from colorectal cancer \nIt is widely accepted that colorectal cancer is among the most preventable, yet least prevented cancers. Colorectal cancer can take up to 10-15 years to progress from a pre-cancerous lesion to metastatic cancer and death. Patients who are diagnosed early in the progression of the disease-with pre-cancerous lesions or polyps or early-stage cancer-are more likely to have a complete recovery and to be treated less expensively. Of the more than 85 million people between the ages of 50 and 85, who are at average-risk for colorectal cancer in the U.S., 38 percent have not been screened according to current guidelines. Internal studies have shown that approximately 50% of Cologuard users were previously unscreened for colorectal cancer. Poor compliance with screening guidelines has meant that nearly two-thirds of colorectal cancer diagnoses are made in the disease's late stages. The five-year survival rates for stages 3 and 4 are 70 percent and 13 percent, respectively. We believe the large underserved population of unscreened and inadequately screened patients represents a significant opportunity for a patient-friendly screening test.\nOur Cologuard test is a non-invasive sDNA screening test that utilizes a multi-target approach to detect DNA and hemoglobin biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer and pre-cancer. Eleven biomarkers are targeted that have been shown to be strongly associated with colorectal cancer and pre-cancer. Methylation, mutation, and hemoglobin results are combined in the laboratory analysis through a proprietary algorithm to provide a single positive or negative reportable result.\nChanges in DNA methylation, and the occurrence of mutations, alter gene expression and other mechanisms for cell cycle regulation and differentiation. As a result, the affected cells continue to proliferate, often resulting in malignancies associated with colorectal cancer and pre-cancer. Hemoglobin is the protein complex responsible for transporting oxygen in red blood cells. During the progression of cancer, the probability of bleeding into the colon increases. The presence of hemoglobin, released from red blood cells, can be detected in the stool. Using sDNA Cologuard purifies, amplifies and detects increased levels of methylation, and presence of mutations, in specific genes. By combining these DNA indicators with a test for hemoglobin, Cologuard produces a multi-marker result effective for the detection of colorectal cancer and pre-cancerous adenomas.\nIn August 2014, the FDA granted PMA to Cologuard for use as a colorectal cancer screening test in adults 50 years of age and older who are at a typical average-risk for colorectal cancer. Upon approval, Cologuard became the first and only FDA-approved sDNA non-invasive colorectal cancer screening test. Our original PMA submission to the FDA for Cologuard included the results of our pivotal DeeP-C clinical trial that had over 10,000 patients enrolled at 90 sites in the U.S. and Canada. The results of our DeeP-C clinical trial for Cologuard were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in April 2014. The peer-reviewed study, Multi-target Stool DNA Testing for Colorectal-Cancer Screening,\u201d highlighted the performance of Cologuard in the trial population:\n \u00b7 Cancer Sensitivity: 92% \n \u00b7 Stage I and II Cancer Sensitivity: 94% \n \u00b7 High-Grade Dysplasia Sensitivity: 69% \n \u00b7 Specificity: 87% \nWe believe the competitive advantages of sDNA screening may provide a significant market opportunity. There are 85 million people in the U.S. between the ages of 50-85 who are at average risk for colorectal cancer. At a three-year screening interval and an average revenue per test of $500 this represents a potential $14 billion market for Cologuard, of which our current share is approximately four percent.\nWe are also seeking to develop a pipeline of potential future products and services with a focus on liquid biopsy tests.\nOur Clinical Laboratory and Manufacturing Facilities\nAs part of our commercialization strategy, we established a state-of-the-art, highly automated lab facility that is certified pursuant to federal CLIA requirements to process Cologuard tests and provide patient results. Our commercial lab operation is housed in a 55,000 square foot facility in Madison, Wisconsin. At our lab, we currently have the capacity to process approximately three million tests per year.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017 we began construction of a new clinical lab facility in Madison, Wisconsin that is expected to be completed mid-2019. After the new clinical laboratory is operational, we expect our total lab capacity at both facilities will be approximately seven million tests per year by the end of 2019.\nWe currently manufacture the Cologuard test in a facility in Madison, Wisconsin. As we expand the commercialization of Cologuard, we believe it will be necessary to expand our manufacturing capacity. Accordingly, we are in the process of building an additional manufacturing facility which we expect to complete in 2019. We are committed to manufacturing and providing medical devices and related products that meet customer expectations and applicable regulatory requirements. We adhere to manufacturing and safety standards required by federal, state, and local laws and regulations and operate our manufacturing facilities under a quality management system. We purchase certain components for our Cologuard test from third-party suppliers and manufacturers.\nHow We Recognize Revenue\nWe recognize revenue on the delivery of a test result to an ordering healthcare provider for tests performed where based on our estimate of the amount that we will ultimately collect at the time delivery is complete. The amount of revenue we recognize is based on the established billing rates less contractual and other adjustments, which yields the constrained amount that we expect to ultimately collect. We determine the amount we expect to ultimately collect on a per-payer or per-agreement basis, using historical collections, established reimbursement rates and other adjustments. The expected amount is typically lower than, if applicable, the agreed-upon reimbursement amount due to several factors, such as the amount of any patient co-payments, the existence of secondary payers and claim denials. Upon ultimate collection, the aggregate amount received from payers and patients where reimbursement was estimated is compared to previous collection estimates and, if necessary, the contractual allowance is adjusted. Finally, should we recognize revenue from claims on an accrual basis and later determine the judgments underlying estimated collections change, our financial results could be negatively impacted in future quarters. Historically, a portion of our revenue was recognized upon cash receipt, because we were unable to reasonably estimate the amount that would ultimately be collected from certain payers. Effective during the first quarter of 2017, we determined that we had the ability to reasonably estimate the amount that will ultimately be collected from all payers, including the impact of patient cost-share collections. Accordingly, as noted above, we now recognize revenue for all billed claims at the time the test results are delivered to the customer.\nOur average reimbursement per test, as further defined below, was approximately $476 and $438 through December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This cumulative average Cologuard reimbursement rate will change over time due to a number of factors, such as medical coverage decisions by payers, changes in the payer mix, the effects of contracts signed with payers, non-renewal or termination of payer contracts, changes in allowed amounts by payers, our ability to successfully win appeals for payment, settlements reached with payers regarding previously denied claims and our ability to collect cash payments from payers and individual patients. Historical average reimbursement is not necessarily indicative of future average reimbursement.\nWe calculate the average Cologuard reimbursement per test on a trailing twelve-month basis for all tests that are at least six months old, since it can take that long, or in some cases longer, to collect from some payers and patients. Thus, the average reimbursement per test at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, represents the total cash collected through such dates for tests performed during the twelve-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively, divided by the number of tests performed during those same periods.\nAcquisitions\nIn October 2018, we completed the acquisition of Biomatrica, a privately held company specializing in the collection and preservation of biological materials. In the acquisition, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests for an aggregate purchase price of $20.0 million net of cash received, debt repaid and certain other adjustments. Contingent consideration for an additional $20.0 million could be earned based upon certain revenue milestones being met.\n2019 Priorities\nOur top priorities for 2019 are to (1) power our partnership with Pfizer, (2) enhance Cologuard through label expansion and product improvements, and (3) advance liquid biopsy.\nPower the Partnership\nIn August 2018, we entered into a Promotion Agreement with Pfizer. Under the terms of the Promotion Agreement, Pfizer agreed to promote Cologuard and provide certain other sales and marketing services. We and Pfizer committed in the Promotion Agreement to invest specified amounts in the advertising and promotion of Cologuard. Pfizer has a large primary care sales team that has extensive experience with large health system organizations and enhances our physician and consumer marketing capabilities. A priority for 2019 is executing on the Pfizer partnership in order to grow the Cologuard brand and get more patients screened with Cologuard.\nEnhance Cologuard\nIn May 2018, the ACS updated its guidelines to recommend colorectal cancer screening beginning at age 45, rather than 50, for people at average risk of the disease due to the rising incidence rate within the 45-49 year-old population. There are nearly 21 million people who are between the ages of 45-49, and we estimate approximately 19 million of them are at average risk for colorectal cancer and would be eligible for screening under the ACS guidelines. We plan to conduct clinical and other necessary work to gain FDA approval to expand Cologuard's indication to people between the ages of 45 and 49 who are at average risk for colorectal cancer.\nIn addition, we are seeking opportunities to improve upon Cologuard's performance characteristics. For example, we are evaluating whether new biomarkers would increase specificity while maintaining sensitivity. If we could increase the specificity of Cologuard, we believe that would enhance its adoption as a front-line screening test. We are also evaluating ways that we might make Cologuard even easier for patients to use and opportunities for lowering the cost of providing Cologuard.\nThe timing of any expansion of Cologuard's indication or of any such enhancements to Cologuard is unknown and would be subject to FDA approval.\nAdvance Liquid Biopsy\nWe also are focusing our research and development efforts on building a pipeline of potential future products and services with a focus on liquid biopsy tests. We will continue to advance liquid biopsy through biomarker discovery and validation in tissue and blood. We have identified proprietary biomarkers for several cancers, including liver cancer and lung cancer. We have successfully performed validation studies on tissue samples for thirteen cancers and on blood samples for eight cancers.\nThe ACS estimates that liver cancer will be diagnosed in 42,000 Americans and cause 32,000 deaths in 2019, three-fourths of which will be hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC\u201d). Incidence and mortality rates are both increasing at approximately 3 percent per year. People who have been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver or Hepatitis B are at high\nrisk of developing HCC. Evidence shows that HCC testing in these high-risk groups leads to earlier detection and improved outcomes. The NCCN and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases ( AASLD\u201d) guidelines recommend that these two groups be tested for HCC every six months using ultrasound and the blood-based biomarker alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP\u201d). However, ultrasound and AFP are documented to have poor sensitivity for early stage cancer, which is the primary target of testing. We are currently seeking to develop a blood-based biomarker test to serve as an alternative to ultrasound and AFP for use in HCC testing, and our goal is to develop a patient-friendly test that performs better than this current standard of care. We are currently enrolling a case control study of at least 1,500 patients to finalize the development of our liver cancer test.\nThe ACS estimates that, in the U.S. in 2019, lung cancer will be diagnosed in 228,000 people and cause 143,000 deaths. Currently, more than half of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage, after symptoms appear, when the five-year survival rate is in the low single digits. We are currently seeking to develop a blood-based biomarker test to aid in the early detection of lung cancer in individuals with lung nodules discovered through a CT or other scan. Such a test may help reduce the number of follow-up procedures, and thereby reduce costs and improve health outcomes.\nResults of Operations\nOur top priorities for 2018 were to (1) continue to strengthen our core Cologuard business by increasing the size of our nationwide sale force, (2) prepare for future demand including by continuing to invest in people, processes, technology and systems to build capacity, and (3) expand our product pipeline by developing additional cancer screening and diagnostic tests.\nDuring 2018, we completed approximately 934,000 Cologuard tests, and generated $454.5 million of revenue compared to 2017 when we completed 571,000 tests and generated $266.0 million of revenue. We believe that the increase in revenues and tests completed from the prior year was primarily driven by sales force execution, our patient advertising campaign, and the increase in commercial coverage for Cologuard. As of December 31, 2018, nearly 147,000 health care providers have ordered Cologuard compared to nearly 102,000 health care providers as of December 31, 2017. In August 2018, we entered into a Promotion Agreement with Pfizer, Inc. Pfizer is promoting Cologuard to both physicians and health systems and will also actively participate in extending and deepening the Cologuard marketing campaign.\nDuring 2018, we made investments in our technical systems, manufacturing capabilities, customer care center, and our sales force in order to enhance our infrastructure and position our operations and processes for continued growth. Additionally, we continued to focus on cost containment throughout the business which, along with the increase in test volume, helped drive improvements in our gross margin from 70 percent for 2017 to 74 percent for 2018.\nIn 2018, we continued to invest in research and development and focused on the development of additional cancer diagnostic tests as outlined in the Advance Liquid Biopsy\u201d section above.\nIn order to support the commercialization of Cologuard and to achieve our goals for 2018, our selling, general, and administrative costs increased by $164.8 million during the year. In addition, our efforts in 2018 to develop our pipeline products and improvements to Cologuard led to an increase in research and development costs of $26.1 million during the year. We ensured that we were well capitalized to meet our future goals by raising $671.1 million and $225.3 million, net of issuance costs, through an underwritten public offering of convertible notes completed in January 2018 and June 2018, respectively, and finished the year with $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nRevenue. Our revenue is primarily generated by performing screening services using our Cologuard test. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we completed approximately 934,000 and 571,000 Cologuard tests, respectively, and generated revenue of $454.5 million and $266.0 million, respectively. The increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in completed Cologuard tests and an increase in average revenue recognized per test during the current period due to increased commercial insurance coverage for our Cologuard test.\nOur cost structure. Our selling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of non-research personnel salaries, office expenses, professional fees, sales and marketing expenses incurred in support of our commercialization efforts and non-cash stock-based compensation.\nCost of sales includes costs related to inventory production and usage, shipment of test collection kits, royalties and the cost of services to process tests and provide results to physicians. We incur expenses for tests in the period in which the activities occur, therefore, gross margin as a percentage of revenue may vary due to costs being incurred in one period that relate to revenues recognized in a later period.\nWe expect that gross margin for our services will continue to fluctuate and be affected by Cologuard test volume, our operating efficiencies, patient compliance rates, payer mix, the levels of reimbursement, and payment patterns of payers and patients.\nCost of sales. Cost of sales increased to $118.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $79.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cost of sales is primarily due to the increases in completed Cologuard tests. The Company completed approximately 934,000 and 571,000 Cologuard tests for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses increased to $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $42.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in direct research and development expenses for our pipeline as well as personnel costs due to increased headcount.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $178.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $109.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of increased costs in the areas outlined in the table below to support the overall growth of the Company.\n\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased to $249.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $153.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was a result of hiring additional sales and marketing personnel and increasing our advertising and\npatient marketing efforts as part of the ongoing commercialization of our Cologuard test.\n\nInvestment income. Investment income increased to $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase in investment income was due to an increase in the average cash and marketable securities balance and an increase in the average rate of return on investments due to an increase in market interest rates for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.\nInterest expense. Net interest expense increased to $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We issued $690.0 million and $218.5 million of convertible debt in January 2018 and June 2018, respectively, which collectively resulted in $36.4 million in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2018. $28.6 million of interest expense relates to amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs for the year ended December 31, 2018. The remaining $7.8 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 relates to the stated interest that was paid in cash during the year. There was minimal interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the mortgage on one of our facilities in Madison, Wisconsin that was entered into in June 2015. The interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 is related solely to the mortgage on one of our facilities in Madison, Wisconsin that was entered into in June 2015.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue. Our revenue is generated by performing screening services using our Cologuard test. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company completed approximately 571,000 and 244,000 Cologuard tests, respectively, and generated revenue of $266.0 million and $99.4 million, respectively. The increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in completed Cologuard tests during the period.\nCost of sales. Cost of sales increased to $79.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $45.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cost of sales is primarily due to the increase in completed Cologuard tests. The company completed approximately 571,000 and 244,000 Cologuard tests for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses increased to $42.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs due to increased headcount and an increase in\ndirect research and development expenses for our pipeline.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $109.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $76.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of increased personnel costs, facility and support costs, legal and professional fees, and stock-based compensation expense to support the overall growth of the Company.\n\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased to $153.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $112.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in sales and marketing expense was a result of hiring additional sales and marketing personnel and increasing our advertising and patient marketing efforts as part of the ongoing commercialization of Cologuard test.\n\nInvestment income. Investment income increased to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase in investment income was due to a higher average balance and return on investments for the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016.\nInterest expense. Net interest expense of $0.2 million was realized for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Interest expense is related to the mortgage on one of our facilities in Madison, Wisconsin that was entered into in June 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our operations since inception primarily through public offerings of our common stock and convertible debt and through revenue generated by the sale of Cologuard. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $160.4 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and approximately $963.8 million in marketable securities.\nAll of our investments in marketable securities consist of fixed income investments, and all are deemed available-for-sale. The objectives of this portfolio are to provide liquidity and safety of principal while striving to achieve the highest rate of return. Our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $69.3 million, $71.7 million, and $130.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The principal use of cash in operating activities for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was to fund our net loss. The decrease in use of cash in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017 and 2016 is primarily due to increased Cologuard revenue and an increase in non-cash expenses such as amortization and stock-based compensation.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $781.9 million, $160.8 million, and $11.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017 and 2016 was primarily the result of the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities following our convertible debt offerings. Excluding the impact of purchases and maturities of marketable securities, net cash used in investing activities was $168.6 million, $75.2 million, and $14.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The increase in investing activities from 2017 to 2018, excluding the impact of purchases and maturities of marketable securities, was primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2018 from increased laboratory equipment purchases, computer equipment and computer software purchases, and assets under construction in order to continue to scale-up our operations for future expected growth of our Cologuard business. Additionally, the increase for 2018 was driven by the acquisition of Biomatrica for $17.9 million compared to 2017 when we completed an acquisition of Sampleminded, Inc. ( Sampleminded\u201d) for $3.0 million. The increase in investing", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nExact Sciences Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, Exact,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d or the Company\u201d) is a molecular diagnostics company focused on the early detection and prevention of some of the deadliest forms of cancer. We have developed an accurate, non-invasive, patient-friendly screening test called Cologuard\u00ae for the early detection of colorectal cancer and pre-cancer, and we are currently working on the development of additional tests for other types of cancer, with the goal of becoming a leader in cancer screening and diagnostics.\nOur Cologuard Test\nColorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. and the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. among non-smokers. Each year in the U.S. there are approximately:\n \u00b7 146,000 new cases of colorectal cancer \n \u00b7 51,000 deaths from colorectal cancer \nIt is widely accepted that colorectal cancer is among the most preventable, yet least prevented cancers. Colorectal cancer can take up to 10-15 years to progress from a pre-cancerous lesion to metastatic cancer and death. Patients who are diagnosed early in the progression of the disease-with pre-cancerous lesions or polyps or early-stage cancer-are more likely to have a complete recovery and to be treated less expensively. Of the more than 85 million people between the ages of 50 and 85, who are at average-risk for colorectal cancer in the U.S., 38 percent have not been screened according to current guidelines. Internal studies have shown that approximately 50% of Cologuard users were previously unscreened for colorectal cancer. Poor compliance with screening guidelines has meant that nearly two-thirds of colorectal cancer diagnoses are made in the disease's late stages. The five-year survival rates for stages 3 and 4 are 70 percent and 13 percent, respectively. We believe the large underserved population of unscreened and inadequately screened patients represents a significant opportunity for a patient-friendly screening test.\nOur Cologuard test is a non-invasive sDNA screening test that utilizes a multi-target approach to detect DNA and hemoglobin biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer and pre-cancer. Eleven biomarkers are targeted that have been shown to be strongly associated with colorectal cancer and pre-cancer. Methylation, mutation, and hemoglobin results are combined in the laboratory analysis through a proprietary algorithm to provide a single positive or negative reportable result.\nChanges in DNA methylation, and the occurrence of mutations, alter gene expression and other mechanisms for cell cycle regulation and differentiation. As a result, the affected cells continue to proliferate, often resulting in malignancies associated with colorectal cancer and pre-cancer. Hemoglobin is the protein complex responsible for transporting oxygen in red blood cells. During the progression of cancer, the probability of bleeding into the colon increases. The presence of hemoglobin, released from red blood cells, can be detected in the stool. Using sDNA Cologuard purifies, amplifies and detects increased levels of methylation, and presence of mutations, in specific genes. By combining these DNA indicators with a test for hemoglobin, Cologuard produces a multi-marker result effective for the detection of colorectal cancer and pre-cancerous adenomas.\nIn August 2014, the FDA granted PMA to Cologuard for use as a colorectal cancer screening test in adults 50 years of age and older who are at a typical average-risk for colorectal cancer. Upon approval, Cologuard became the first and only FDA-approved sDNA non-invasive colorectal cancer screening test. Our original PMA submission to the FDA for Cologuard included the results of our pivotal DeeP-C clinical trial that had over 10,000 patients enrolled at 90 sites in the U.S. and Canada. The results of our DeeP-C clinical trial for Cologuard were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in April 2014. The peer-reviewed study, Multi-target Stool DNA Testing for Colorectal-Cancer Screening,\u201d highlighted the performance of Cologuard in the trial population:\n \u00b7 Cancer Sensitivity: 92% \n \u00b7 Stage I and II Cancer Sensitivity: 94% \n \u00b7 High-Grade Dysplasia Sensitivity: 69% \n \u00b7 Specificity: 87% \nWe believe the competitive advantages of sDNA screening may provide a significant market opportunity. There are 85 million people in the U.S. between the ages of 50-85 who are at average risk for colorectal cancer. At a three-year screening interval and an average revenue per test of $500 this represents a potential $14 billion market for Cologuard, of which our current share is approximately four percent.\nWe are also seeking to develop a pipeline of potential future products and services with a focus on liquid biopsy tests.\nOur Clinical Laboratory and Manufacturing Facilities\nAs part of our commercialization strategy, we established a state-of-the-art, highly automated lab facility that is certified pursuant to federal CLIA requirements to process Cologuard tests and provide patient results. Our commercial lab operation is housed in a 55,000 square foot facility in Madison, Wisconsin. At our lab, we currently have the capacity to process approximately three million tests per year.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017 we began construction of a new clinical lab facility in Madison, Wisconsin that is expected to be completed mid-2019. After the new clinical laboratory is operational, we expect our total lab capacity at both facilities will be approximately seven million tests per year by the end of 2019.\nWe currently manufacture the Cologuard test in a facility in Madison, Wisconsin. As we expand the commercialization of Cologuard, we believe it will be necessary to expand our manufacturing capacity. Accordingly, we are in the process of building an additional manufacturing facility which we expect to complete in 2019. We are committed to manufacturing and providing medical devices and related products that meet customer expectations and applicable regulatory requirements. We adhere to manufacturing and safety standards required by federal, state, and local laws and regulations and operate our manufacturing facilities under a quality management system. We purchase certain components for our Cologuard test from third-party suppliers and manufacturers.\nHow We Recognize Revenue\nWe recognize revenue on the delivery of a test result to an ordering healthcare provider for tests performed where based on our estimate of the amount that we will ultimately collect at the time delivery is complete. The amount of revenue we recognize is based on the established billing rates less contractual and other adjustments, which yields the constrained amount that we expect to ultimately collect. We determine the amount we expect to ultimately collect on a per-payer or per-agreement basis, using historical collections, established reimbursement rates and other adjustments. The expected amount is typically lower than, if applicable, the agreed-upon reimbursement amount due to several factors, such as the amount of any patient co-payments, the existence of secondary payers and claim denials. Upon ultimate collection, the aggregate amount received from payers and patients where reimbursement was estimated is compared to previous collection estimates and, if necessary, the contractual allowance is adjusted. Finally, should we recognize revenue from claims on an accrual basis and later determine the judgments underlying estimated collections change, our financial results could be negatively impacted in future quarters. Historically, a portion of our revenue was recognized upon cash receipt, because we were unable to reasonably estimate the amount that would ultimately be collected from certain payers. Effective during the first quarter of 2017, we determined that we had the ability to reasonably estimate the amount that will ultimately be collected from all payers, including the impact of patient cost-share collections. Accordingly, as noted above, we now recognize revenue for all billed claims at the time the test results are delivered to the customer.\nOur average reimbursement per test, as further defined below, was approximately $476 and $438 through December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This cumulative average Cologuard reimbursement rate will change over time due to a number of factors, such as medical coverage decisions by payers, changes in the payer mix, the effects of contracts signed with payers, non-renewal or termination of payer contracts, changes in allowed amounts by payers, our ability to successfully win appeals for payment, settlements reached with payers regarding previously denied claims and our ability to collect cash payments from payers and individual patients. Historical average reimbursement is not necessarily indicative of future average reimbursement.\nWe calculate the average Cologuard reimbursement per test on a trailing twelve-month basis for all tests that are at least six months old, since it can take that long, or in some cases longer, to collect from some payers and patients. Thus, the average reimbursement per test at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, represents the total cash collected through such dates for tests performed during the twelve-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively, divided by the number of tests performed during those same periods.\nAcquisitions\nIn October 2018, we completed the acquisition of Biomatrica, a privately held company specializing in the collection and preservation of biological materials. In the acquisition, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests for an aggregate purchase price of $20.0 million net of cash received, debt repaid and certain other adjustments. Contingent consideration for an additional $20.0 million could be earned based upon certain revenue milestones being met.\n2019 Priorities\nOur top priorities for 2019 are to (1) power our partnership with Pfizer, (2) enhance Cologuard through label expansion and product improvements, and (3) advance liquid biopsy.\nPower the Partnership\nIn August 2018, we entered into a Promotion Agreement with Pfizer. Under the terms of the Promotion Agreement, Pfizer agreed to promote Cologuard and provide certain other sales and marketing services. We and Pfizer committed in the Promotion Agreement to invest specified amounts in the advertising and promotion of Cologuard. Pfizer has a large primary care sales team that has extensive experience with large health system organizations and enhances our physician and consumer marketing capabilities. A priority for 2019 is executing on the Pfizer partnership in order to grow the Cologuard brand and get more patients screened with Cologuard.\nEnhance Cologuard\nIn May 2018, the ACS updated its guidelines to recommend colorectal cancer screening beginning at age 45, rather than 50, for people at average risk of the disease due to the rising incidence rate within the 45-49 year-old population. There are nearly 21 million people who are between the ages of 45-49, and we estimate approximately 19 million of them are at average risk for colorectal cancer and would be eligible for screening under the ACS guidelines. We plan to conduct clinical and other necessary work to gain FDA approval to expand Cologuard's indication to people between the ages of 45 and 49 who are at average risk for colorectal cancer.\nIn addition, we are seeking opportunities to improve upon Cologuard's performance characteristics. For example, we are evaluating whether new biomarkers would increase specificity while maintaining sensitivity. If we could increase the specificity of Cologuard, we believe that would enhance its adoption as a front-line screening test. We are also evaluating ways that we might make Cologuard even easier for patients to use and opportunities for lowering the cost of providing Cologuard.\nThe timing of any expansion of Cologuard's indication or of any such enhancements to Cologuard is unknown and would be subject to FDA approval.\nAdvance Liquid Biopsy\nWe also are focusing our research and development efforts on building a pipeline of potential future products and services with a focus on liquid biopsy tests. We will continue to advance liquid biopsy through biomarker discovery and validation in tissue and blood. We have identified proprietary biomarkers for several cancers, including liver cancer and lung cancer. We have successfully performed validation studies on tissue samples for thirteen cancers and on blood samples for eight cancers.\nThe ACS estimates that liver cancer will be diagnosed in 42,000 Americans and cause 32,000 deaths in 2019, three-fourths of which will be hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC\u201d). Incidence and mortality rates are both increasing at approximately 3 percent per year. People who have been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver or Hepatitis B are at high\nrisk of developing HCC. Evidence shows that HCC testing in these high-risk groups leads to earlier detection and improved outcomes. The NCCN and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases ( AASLD\u201d) guidelines recommend that these two groups be tested for HCC every six months using ultrasound and the blood-based biomarker alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP\u201d). However, ultrasound and AFP are documented to have poor sensitivity for early stage cancer, which is the primary target of testing. We are currently seeking to develop a blood-based biomarker test to serve as an alternative to ultrasound and AFP for use in HCC testing, and our goal is to develop a patient-friendly test that performs better than this current standard of care. We are currently enrolling a case control study of at least 1,500 patients to finalize the development of our liver cancer test.\nThe ACS estimates that, in the U.S. in 2019, lung cancer will be diagnosed in 228,000 people and cause 143,000 deaths. Currently, more than half of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage, after symptoms appear, when the five-year survival rate is in the low single digits. We are currently seeking to develop a blood-based biomarker test to aid in the early detection of lung cancer in individuals with lung nodules discovered through a CT or other scan. Such a test may help reduce the number of follow-up procedures, and thereby reduce costs and improve health outcomes.\nResults of Operations\nOur top priorities for 2018 were to (1) continue to strengthen our core Cologuard business by increasing the size of our nationwide sale force, (2) prepare for future demand including by continuing to invest in people, processes, technology and systems to build capacity, and (3) expand our product pipeline by developing additional cancer screening and diagnostic tests.\nDuring 2018, we completed approximately 934,000 Cologuard tests, and generated $454.5 million of revenue compared to 2017 when we completed 571,000 tests and generated $266.0 million of revenue. We believe that the increase in revenues and tests completed from the prior year was primarily driven by sales force execution, our patient advertising campaign, and the increase in commercial coverage for Cologuard. As of December 31, 2018, nearly 147,000 health care providers have ordered Cologuard compared to nearly 102,000 health care providers as of December 31, 2017. In August 2018, we entered into a Promotion Agreement with Pfizer, Inc. Pfizer is promoting Cologuard to both physicians and health systems and will also actively participate in extending and deepening the Cologuard marketing campaign.\nDuring 2018, we made investments in our technical systems, manufacturing capabilities, customer care center, and our sales force in order to enhance our infrastructure and position our operations and processes for continued growth. Additionally, we continued to focus on cost containment throughout the business which, along with the increase in test volume, helped drive improvements in our gross margin from 70 percent for 2017 to 74 percent for 2018.\nIn 2018, we continued to invest in research and development and focused on the development of additional cancer diagnostic tests as outlined in the Advance Liquid Biopsy\u201d section above.\nIn order to support the commercialization of Cologuard and to achieve our goals for 2018, our selling, general, and administrative costs increased by $164.8 million during the year. In addition, our efforts in 2018 to develop our pipeline products and improvements to Cologuard led to an increase in research and development costs of $26.1 million during the year. We ensured that we were well capitalized to meet our future goals by raising $671.1 million and $225.3 million, net of issuance costs, through an underwritten public offering of convertible notes completed in January 2018 and June 2018, respectively, and finished the year with $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nRevenue. Our revenue is primarily generated by performing screening services using our Cologuard test. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we completed approximately 934,000 and 571,000 Cologuard tests, respectively, and generated revenue of $454.5 million and $266.0 million, respectively. The increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in completed Cologuard tests and an increase in average revenue recognized per test during the current period due to increased commercial insurance coverage for our Cologuard test.\nOur cost structure. Our selling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of non-research personnel salaries, office expenses, professional fees, sales and marketing expenses incurred in support of our commercialization efforts and non-cash stock-based compensation.\nCost of sales includes costs related to inventory production and usage, shipment of test collection kits, royalties and the cost of services to process tests and provide results to physicians. We incur expenses for tests in the period in which the activities occur, therefore, gross margin as a percentage of revenue may vary due to costs being incurred in one period that relate to revenues recognized in a later period.\nWe expect that gross margin for our services will continue to fluctuate and be affected by Cologuard test volume, our operating efficiencies, patient compliance rates, payer mix, the levels of reimbursement, and payment patterns of payers and patients.\nCost of sales. Cost of sales increased to $118.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $79.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cost of sales is primarily due to the increases in completed Cologuard tests. The Company completed approximately 934,000 and 571,000 Cologuard tests for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProduction costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n82.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n57.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n25.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFacility and support services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPersonnel expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther cost of sales expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal cost of sales expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n118.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n79.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n38.8\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses.

Investment income increased to $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase in investment income was due to an increase in the average cash and marketable securities balance and an increase in the average rate of return on investments due to an increase in market interest rates for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.\nInterest expense. Net interest expense increased to $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Investment income increased to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase in investment income was due to a higher average balance and return on investments for the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016.\nInterest expense. Net interest expense of $0.2 million was realized for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Interest expense is related to the mortgage on one of our facilities in Madison, Wisconsin that was entered into in June 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our operations since inception primarily through public offerings of our common stock and convertible debt and through revenue generated by the sale of Cologuard. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $160.4 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and approximately $963.8 million in marketable securities.\nAll of our investments in marketable securities consist of fixed income investments, and all are deemed available-for-sale. The objectives of this portfolio are to provide liquidity and safety of principal while striving to achieve the highest rate of return. Our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $69.3 million, $71.7 million, and $130.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The principal use of cash in operating activities for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was to fund our net loss. The decrease in use of cash in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017 and 2016 is primarily due to increased Cologuard revenue and an increase in non-cash expenses such as amortization and stock-based compensation.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $781.9 million, $160.8 million, and $11.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017 and 2016 was primarily the result of the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities following our convertible debt offerings. Excluding the impact of purchases and maturities of marketable securities, net cash used in investing activities was $168.6 million, $75.2 million, and $14.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The increase in investing activities from 2017 to 2018, excluding the impact of purchases and maturities of marketable securities, was primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2018 from increased laboratory equipment purchases, computer equipment and computer software purchases, and assets under construction in order to continue to scale-up our operations for future expected growth of our Cologuard business. Additionally, the increase for 2018 was driven by the acquisition of Biomatrica for $17.9 million compared to 2017 when we completed an acquisition of Sampleminded, Inc. ( Sampleminded\u201d) for $3.0 million. The increase in investing"}
