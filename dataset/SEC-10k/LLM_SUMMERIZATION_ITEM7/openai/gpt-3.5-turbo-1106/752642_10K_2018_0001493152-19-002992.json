Forward-looking statements provide our current expectations or forecasts of future events. Forward-looking statements include statements about the Company's expectations, beliefs, intentions, plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, performance and underlying assumptions and other statements that are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements can be identified by their use of forward-looking words, such as may,\u201d will,\u201d anticipate,\u201d expect,\u201d believe,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d should,\u201d seek\u201d or comparable terms, or the negative use of those words, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking.\nThe forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future performance, taking into account all information currently available to us. Forward-looking statements are not predictions of future events. These beliefs, assumptions and expectations can change as a result of many possible events or factors, not all of which are known to us. Some of these factors are described below and under the headings Business\u201d, Risk Factors\u201d and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d. These and other risks, uncertainties and factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those included in any forward-looking statements we make. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made. New risks and uncertainties arise over time, and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us.

We have:\nTable 95: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Generated a 12% increase in Normalized FFO per share; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Increased Rental and Related Income by 12%; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Increased Community Net Operating Income ( NOI\u201d) by 13%; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Improved our Operating Expense ratio by 50 basis points to 46.5%; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Increased Same Property NOI by 7%; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Increased Same Property Occupancy by 40 basis points from 82.6% to 83.0%; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Increased home sales by 45%; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Acquired 6 communities containing approximately 1,600 homesites for a total cost of $59.1 million, bringing our total property portfolio to 118 manufactured home communities with approximately 21,500 developed homesites; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Increased our rental home portfolio by 905 homes to approximately 6,500 total rental homes, representing an increase of 16%; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Expanded and extended our existing unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing the available borrowings and reducing interest costs. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Issued 2,000,000 shares of a new 6.375% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, for net proceeds after deducting the underwriting discount and other estimated offering expenses, of approximately $48 million; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Raised $35.1 million through our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nThe following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data\u201d and the historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nThe Company is a self-administered, self-managed, REIT with headquarters in Freehold, New Jersey. The Company's primary business is the ownership and operation of manufactured home communities, which includes leasing manufactured home spaces on an annual or month-to-month basis to residential manufactured home owners. The Company also leases homes to residents and, through its taxable REIT subsidiary, S&F, sells and finances homes to residents and prospective residents of our communities.\nOur communities are located in New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Indiana, Michigan and Maryland. UMH has continued to execute our growth strategy of purchasing well-located communities in our target markets, including the energy-rich Marcellus and Utica Shale regions. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we purchased six manufactured home communities, for an aggregate purchase price of $59,093,000. These acquisitions added approximately 1,600 developed homesites to our portfolio, bringing our total to 118 communities containing approximately 21,500 developed homesites.\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 33 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company earns income from the operation of its manufactured home communities, leasing of manufactured homesites, the rental of manufactured homes, the sale and finance of manufactured homes, the brokering of home sales, and from appreciation in the values of the manufactured home communities and vacant land owned by the Company. Management views the Company as a single segment based on its method of internal reporting in addition to its allocation of capital and resources. The Company also invests in securities of other REITs which the Company generally limits to no more than approximately 15% of its undepreciated assets.\nOccupancy in our properties, as well as our ability to increase rental rates, directly affects revenues. In 2018, total income increased 15.0% from the prior year and Community NOI (as defined below) increased 12.8% from the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition and rental programs in 2017 and 2018. Overall occupancy increased from 81.4% at December 31, 2017 to 82.0% at December 31, 2018. Same property occupancy, which includes communities owned and operated as of January 1, 2017, increased from 82.6% at December 31, 2017 to 83.0% at December 31, 2018. Overall occupancy includes communities acquired in 2018 at a weighted average occupancy of 80%.\nSales of manufactured homes performed exceptionally well during 2018, increasing by 45% year-over-year. Demand for housing remains healthy, due to improvements in the economy, sustained wage and job growth and still favorable interest rates. Conventional single-family home prices continue their rise supported by low inventories and increasing sales. As household formation strengthens and for-sale inventory remains limited, a large share of housing demand will be looking at alternative forms of housing. Our property type offers substantial comparative value that should result in increased demand.\nThe macro-economic environment and current housing fundamentals continue to favor home rentals. The inability to satisfy down payment requirements, more stringent credit terms, and steadily increasing home prices continue to create hurdles for would-be homebuyers. Rental homes in a manufactured home community allow the resident to obtain the efficiencies of factory-built housing and the amenities of community living for less than the cost of other forms of affordable housing. We continue to see increased demand for rental homes. During 2018, our portfolio of rental homes increased by 905 homes. Occupied rental homes represent approximately 34.1% of total occupied sites. Occupancy in rental homes continues to be strong and is at 92.3% as of December 31, 2018. We compare favorably with other types of rental housing, including apartments, and we will continue to allocate capital to rental home purchases, as demand dictates.\nThe Company holds a portfolio of marketable securities of other REITs with a fair value of $99,595,736 at December 31, 2018, representing 9.3% of our undepreciated assets (total assets excluding accumulated depreciation). The Company generally limits its marketable securities investments to no more than approximately 15% of its undepreciated assets. The REIT securities portfolio provides the Company with additional diversification, liquidity and income, and serves as a proxy for real estate when more favorable risk adjusted returns are not available. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's portfolio consisted of 3% REIT preferred stocks and 97% REIT common stocks.\nThe Company invests in these REIT securities and, from time to time, may use margin debt when an adequate yield spread can be obtained. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has borrowings of $31,975,086 under its margin line at 2.75% interest. The Company's weighted average yield on the securities portfolio was approximately 7.3% at December 31, 2018. The Company realized a net gain of $20,107 on sale of securities in 2018 as compared to a net gain of $1,747,528 during 2017. At December 31, 2018, the Company had unrealized losses of $(40,155,814) in its REIT securities portfolio. The dividends received from our securities investments continue to meet our expectations. It is our intent to hold these securities for investment on a long-term basis.\nThe Company continues to strengthen its balance sheet. During 2018, the Company raised approximately $35.1 million in new capital through the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan ( DRIP\u201d). The Company also reduced its cost of capital in 2018 by issuing 2,000,000 shares of a new 6.375% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ( Series D Preferred Stock\u201d) for net proceeds of $48.2 million.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $7.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $25 million available on our credit facility, with an additional $50 million potentially available pursuant to an accordion feature. We also had $18.6 million available on our revolving lines of credit for the financing of home sales and the purchase of inventory. In addition, we held approximately $99.6 million in marketable REIT securities encumbered by $32.0 million in margin loans. In general, the Company may borrow up to 50% of the value of the marketable securities.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 34 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company intends to continue to increase its real estate investments. Our business plan includes acquiring communities that yield in excess of our cost of funds and then making physical improvements, including adding rental homes onto otherwise vacant sites. In 2017 and 2018, we have added a total of seventeen manufactured home communities to our portfolio, encompassing approximately 3,600 developed sites. These manufactured home communities were acquired with an average occupancy rate of 71%. The Company will utilize the rental home program to increase occupancy rates and improve operating results at these communities. There is no guarantee that any additional opportunities will materialize or that the Company will be able to take advantage of such opportunities. The growth of our real estate portfolio depends on the availability of suitable properties which meet the Company's investment criteria and appropriate financing. Competition in the market areas in which the Company operates is significant and affects acquisitions, occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of certain properties.\nSee PART I, Item 1 - Business and Item 1A - Risk Factors for a more complete discussion of the economic and industry-wide factors relevant to the Company, the Company's lines of business and principal products and services, and the opportunities, challenges and risks on which the Company is focused.\nAcquisitions\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>Community </td> <td> </td> <td>Date of Acquisition </td> <td> </td>

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include certain non-GAAP financial measures that in management's view of the business we believe are meaningful as they allow the investor the ability to understand key operating details of our business both with and without regard to certain accounting conventions or items that may not always be indicative of recurring annual cash flow of the portfolio. These non-GAAP financial measures as determined and presented by us may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies, and include Community Net Operating Income ( Community NOI\u201d), Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders ( FFO\u201d), Core Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders ( Core FFO\u201d) and Normalized Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders ( Normalized FFO\u201d).\nWe define Community NOI as rental and related income less community operating expenses such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, community salaries, utilities, insurance and other expenses. We believe that Community NOI is helpful to investors and analysts as a direct measure of the actual operating results of our manufactured home communities, rather than our Company overall. Community NOI should not be considered a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Community NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indicator of our financial performance, or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity; nor is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.\nThe Company's Community NOI is calculated as follows:\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Rental and Related Income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113,832,660 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,801,425 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90,679,557 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74,762,548 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,886,010 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Community Operating Expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52,948,510 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47,846,565 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42,638,333 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37,049,462 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,592,327 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Community NOI </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,884,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,954,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,041,224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,713,086 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,293,683 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe also assess and measure our overall operating results based upon an industry performance measure referred to as FFO, which management believes is a useful indicator of our operating performance. FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of a REIT. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders, as defined by GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined under GAAP, gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization. NAREIT created FFO as a non-GAAP supplemental measure of REIT operating performance. We define Core FFO as FFO , excluding acquisition costs, costs of early extinguishment of debt, change in the fair value of marketable securities and costs associated with the redemption of preferred stock. We define Normalized FFO as Core FFO excluding gains and losses realized on securities investments and certain non-recurring charges. FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO should be considered as supplemental measures of operating performance used by REITs. FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO exclude historical cost depreciation as an expense and may facilitate the comparison of REITs which have a different cost basis.

31, 2018, or 12%. This increase was due to the acquisitions during 2017 and 2018, as well as an increase in rental rates, same property occupancy and additional rental homes. During 2018, the Company raised rental rates by 3% to 4% at most communities. Rent increases vary depending on overall market conditions and demand. Occupancy, as well as the ability to increase rental rates, directly affects revenues. The Company has been acquiring communities with vacant sites that can potentially be occupied and earn income in the future. Overall occupancy has increased from to 81.4% at December 31, 2017 to 82.0% at December 31, 2018. Overall occupancy includes communities acquired in 2018 and 2017, which had a weighted average occupancy of 79% and 67%, respectively, at the time of acquisition. Same property occupancy has increased from 82.6% at December 31, 2017 to 83.0% at December 31, 2018. The same property occupancy rate is exclusive of the sites at Memphis Blues, which is under redevelopment due to a flood in 2011. Demand for rental homes continues to be strong. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 6,500 rental homes with an occupancy of 92.3%. We continue to evaluate the demand for rental homes and will invest in additional homes as demand dictates. Vacant sites allow for future revenue growth.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 37 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommunity operating expenses increased from $47,846,565 for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $52,948,510 for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 11%. This increase was due to the acquisitions during 2017 and 2018.\nCommunity NOI increased from $53,954,860 for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $60,884,150 for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 13%. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions during 2017 and 2018 and an increase in rental rates, occupancy and rental homes. The Operating Expense Ratio (defined as Community Operating Expenses divided by Rental and Related Income) also improved from 47.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 46.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Many acquisitions have deferred maintenance requiring higher than normal expenditures in the first few years of ownership. Because most of the community expenses are fixed costs, as occupancy rates continue to increase, these expense ratios will continue to improve. Because of the Company's ability to increase its rental rates annually, increasing costs due to inflation and changing prices have generally not had a material effect on revenues and income from continuing operations.\nSales of manufactured homes increased from $10,846,494 for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $15,754,033 for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 45%. The total number of homes sold was 295 homes in 2018 as compared to 222 homes in 2017. There were 125 new homes sold in 2018 as compared to 74 in 2017. The Company's average sales price was $53,404 and $48,858 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cost of sales of manufactured homes increased from $8,471,190 for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $11,715,987 for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 38%. The gross profit percentage was 26% and 22% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Selling expenses increased from $3,095,155 for the year ended December 31, 2107 to $3,774,425 for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 22%. Gain (Loss) from the sales operations (defined as sales of manufactured homes less cost of sales of manufactured homes less selling expenses less interest on the financing of inventory) decreased from a loss $1,147,501 for the year ended December 31, 2017 to a gain of $75,064 for the year ended December 31, 2018, an improvement of 107%. The gain on sales include selling expenses of approximately $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Many of these costs, such as rent, salaries, and to an extent, advertising and promotion, are fixed. Although sales of manufactured homes have not yet returned to pre-recession levels, the Company has experienced three consecutive years of double-digit sales growth. The Company is encouraged by our sales operations' return to profitability. The U.S. homeownership rate was 64.8% in the fourth quarter of 2018, according to the U.S. Census. This is down from 69.2% at its peak at the end of 2004. The conventional single-family housing market has strengthened, and conventional home prices continue their rise. The inherent affordability of our property type becomes more and more apparent which should result in increased demand. The Company continues to be optimistic about future sales and rental prospects given the fundamental need for affordable housing. The Company believes that sales of new homes produce new rental revenue and is an investment in the upgrading of our communities.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses increased from $9,645,681 for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $10,879,419 for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 13%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel and personnel costs, as headcount, wages and incentive compensation increased in connection with the Company's growth, and an increase in non-cash stock compensation expense. Stock compensation expense increased from $1,314,491 for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $1,613,110 for the year ended December 31, 2018. These increases were primarily due to an increase in the weighted-average fair value of options granted from $1.81 per share for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $2.05 per share for the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, the Founder and Chairman of the Board was granted a discretionary stock option award of 100,000 shares, as well as 1,000 shares of restricted stock. Although these awards are usually recognized over the vesting period, the entire compensation cost of approximately $210,000 was recognized at the time of grant since he is of retirement age. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2018, there was a one-time payroll expenditure of $525,000 for two employees. General and Administrative expenses without this one-time payroll expenditure as a percentage of gross revenue (Total Income plus Interest, Dividend and Other Income) remains in line at 7.3% and 7.8% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nDepreciation expense increased from $27,557,746 for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $31,691,209 for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 15%.

This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of notes receivable from $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $26.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 38 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDividend income increased from $8,134,898 for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $10,367,155 for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 27%. This increase was due to an increase in the cost of securities from $121.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $139.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The dividends received from our securities investments were at a weighted average yield of 7.3% and 7.4% as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and continue to meet our expectations.

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-01, which requires changes in the fair value of our marketable securities to be recorded in current period earnings. Previously, changes in the fair value of marketable securities were recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\u201d on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As a result, on January 1, 2018 the Company recorded an increase to beginning undistributed income (accumulated deficit) of $11,519,582 to recognize the unrealized gains previously recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\u201d on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

This decrease is mainly due to an upfront oil and gas bonus payment in 2017 of $251,680 that the Company received at one of its communities.\nInterest expense, including amortization of financing costs, remained relatively stable for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year, we obtained 2 new mortgage loans, and assumed 2 loans in conjunction with acquisitions, totaling $33 million. The average balance of mortgages payable was approximately $318 million during 2018 as compared to approximately $299 million during 2017. The weighted average interest rate on its mortgages, not including the effect of unamortized debt issuance costs, was 4.3% at December 31, 2018 as compared to 4.2% at December 31, 2017.\nvs. 2016\nRental and related income increased from $90,679,557 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $101,801,425 for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 12%. This increase was due to the acquisitions during 2016 and 2017, as well as an increase in rental rates, same property occupancy and additional rental homes. During 2017, the Company raised rental rates by 3% to 4% at most communities. Rent increases vary depending on overall market conditions and demand.

This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions and the increase in rental homes during 2016 and 2017.\nInterest income increased from $1,584,585 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $2,006,880 for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 27%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of notes receivable from $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDividend income increased from $6,636,126 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $8,134,898 for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 23%. This increase was due to an increase in the average balance of securities from $91.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $120.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The dividends received from our securities investments were at a weighted average yield of 7.4% and 6.8% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRealized gain on sales of marketable securities, net consists of the following:\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross realized gains </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,749,034 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,287,454 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross realized losses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,506 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,153 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Gain on Sales of Marketable Securities, net </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,747,528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,285,301 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company had an accumulated net unrealized gain on its securities portfolio of $11,519,582 as of December 31, 2017.\nOther income increased from $504,759 at December 31, 2016 to $705,048 at December 31, 2017. The increase is mainly due to an upfront oil and gas bonus payment of $251,680 that the Company received at one of its communities.\nInterest expense remained relatively stable for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year, we obtained 3 new mortgage loans, and assumed 1 loan in conjunction with an acquisition, totaling $47 million. The average balance of mortgages payable was approximately $299 million during 2017 as compared to approximately $288 million during 2016. The weighted average interest rate on its mortgages, not including the effect of unamortized debt issuance costs, was 4.2% at December 31, 2017 as compared to 4.3% at December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company operates as a REIT deriving its income primarily from real estate rental operations. The Company's principal liquidity demands have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, payments of expenses relating to real estate operations, acquisitions, capital improvements, development and expansions of properties, debt service, purchases of manufactured homes, investment in debt and equity securities of other REITs, financing of manufactured home sales and distribution requirements. The Company's ability to generate cash adequate to meet these demands is dependent primarily on income from its real estate investments and securities portfolio, the sale of real estate investments and securities, financing and refinancing of mortgage debt, leveraging of real estate investments, availability of bank borrowings, proceeds from the DRIP, and access to the capital markets.\nThe Company intends to operate its existing properties from the cash flows generated by the properties. However, the Company's expenses are affected by various factors, including inflation. Increases in operating expenses raise the breakeven point for a property and, to the extent that they cannot be passed on through higher rents, reduce the amount of available cash flow which can adversely affect the market value of the property.\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 41 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company continues to strengthen its capital and liquidity positions. The Company has a DRIP in which participants can purchase stock from the Company at a price of approximately 95% of market. During 2018, amounts received, including dividends reinvested of $5.1 million, totaled $35.1 million. The Company also issued 2,000,000 shares of its Series D Preferred Stock in an underwritten registered public offering, raising net proceeds of approximately $48 million.\nOn November 29, 2018, the Company entered into a First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to expand and extend its existing unsecured revolving credit facility. The Facility is syndicated with two banks led by BMO Capital Markets Corp., as sole lead arranger and sole book runner, with Bank of Montreal as administrative agent, and includes JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as the sole syndication agent. The Amendment provides for an increase from $50 million in available borrowings to $75 million in available borrowings with a $50 million accordion feature, bringing the total potential availability up to $125 million, subject to certain conditions including obtaining commitments from additional lenders. The Amendment also extends the maturity date of the Facility from March 27, 2020 to November 29, 2022, with a one-year extension available at the Company's option, subject to certain conditions including payment of an extension fee. Availability under the Facility is limited to 60% of the value of the unencumbered communities which the Company has placed in the Facility's unencumbered asset pool. The Amendment increased the value of the Borrowing Base communities by reducing the capitalization rate applied to the Net Operating Income generated by the communities in the Borrowing Base from 7.5% to 7.0%. As of December 31, 2018, $25 million was available on this credit facility.\nThe Company has the ability to finance home sales, inventory purchases and rental home purchases. The Company has a $10 million revolving line of credit for the financing of homes, of which $4 million was utilized at December 31, 2018, and revolving credit facilities totaling $28.5 million to finance inventory purchases, of which $15.9 million was utilized at December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had $7.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $99.6 million encumbered by $32.0 million in margin loans. The Company owns 118 communities of which 45 are unencumbered. The Company's marketable securities and non-mortgaged properties provide us with additional liquidity. The Company believes that cash on hand, funds generated from operations, the DRIP and capital market, the funds available on the lines of credit, together with the ability to finance and refinance its properties will provide sufficient funds to adequately meet its obligations over the next several years.\nThe Company's focus is on real estate investments. The Company has historically financed purchases of real estate primarily through mortgages. During 2018, total investment property increased 15% or $117 million. The Company made acquisitions of six manufactured home communities totaling approximately 1,600 developed sites at an aggregate purchase price of $59.1 million. These acquisitions were funded through new mortgages, the use of our unsecured credit facility and the issuance of preferred stock. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our acquisitions and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for related debt transactions. The Company continues to evaluate acquisition opportunities. The funds for these acquisitions may come from bank borrowings, proceeds from the DRIP, and private placements or public offerings of common or preferred stock. To the extent that funds or appropriate properties are not available, fewer acquisitions will be made.\nThe Company also invests in rental homes and as of December 31, 2018 the Company owned approximately 6,500 rental homes, or approximately 30% of our total homesites. During 2018, our rental home portfolio increased by 905 homes or $37.6 million. The Company markets these rental homes for sale to existing residents. The Company estimates that in 2019 it will purchase approximately 800 manufactured homes to use as rental units for a total cost, including setup, of approximately $36 million. Rental home rates on new homes range from $700-$1,200 per month, including lot rent, depending on size, location and market conditions. During 2018, the Company also invested approximately $17 million in other improvements to our communities.\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 42 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditionally, the Company invests in marketable debt and equity securities of other REITs. The REIT securities portfolio provides the Company with additional liquidity and income and serves as a proxy for real estate when more favorable risk adjusted returns are not available. The Company generally limits its marketable securities investments to no more than approximately 15% of its undepreciated assets. During 2018, the securities portfolio decreased 25% or $33.4 million primarily due to a net unrealized loss of $51.7 million and sales of securities with a cost of $249,000, offset by purchases of $18.6 million. The Company recognized gains on sales of securities of approximately $20,000 in addition to the dividend income earned of $10.4 million. The Company from time to time may purchase these securities on margin when there is an adequate yield spread. At December 31, 2018, $32.0 million was outstanding on the margin loan at a 2.75% interest rate.\nThe following table summarizes cash flow activity for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,175,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,857,424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,203,209 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net Cash Used in Investing Activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(137,603,160 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(152,919,761 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(77,567,391 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82,314,136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130,604,097 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,894,673 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash, Cash\nEquivalents and Restricted Cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,113,838 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,541,760 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,469,509 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities remained relatively stable from 2017 to 2018. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $12.0 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to increased income from operations generated from acquisitions and increased rental homes and a smaller increase in inventory purchases.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $15.3 million in 2018 primarily due to a decrease in acquisitions of manufactured home communities and a decrease in purchases of REIT securities. Net cash used in investing activities increased by $75.4 million in 2017 primarily due to an increase in acquisitions of manufactured home communities and an increase in our REIT securities portfolio.\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased by $48.3 million in 2018 to $82.3 million. The Company received $35.1 million, including dividends reinvested, through the DRIP, and issued 2,000,000 shares of its Series D Preferred Stock in an underwritten registered public offering, raising net proceeds of approximately $48 million. During 2018, the Company also distributed to our common shareholders a total of $26.6 million, including dividends reinvested. It is anticipated, although no assurances can be given, that the level of participation in the DRIP in 2019 will be comparable to 2018. In addition, the Company also paid $20.0 million in preferred dividends.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased by $84.7 million in 2017 to $130.6 million. The Company received $60.4 million, including dividends reinvested, through the DRIP, issued 1,400,000 shares of its common stock in a registered direct placement, raising net proceeds of $22.5 million, and issued 5,750,000 shares of its Series C Preferred Stock in an underwritten registered public offering, raising net proceeds of approximately $139 million. $91.6 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock was used to redeem all of the 3,663,800 outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock. During 2017, the Company also distributed to our common shareholders a total of $23.6 million, including dividends reinvested. In addition, the Company also paid $16.7 million in preferred dividends.\nCash flows were primarily used for purchases of manufactured home communities, capital improvements, payment of dividends, purchases of marketable securities, purchase of inventory and rental homes, loans to customers for the sales of manufactured homes, and expansion of existing communities. The Company meets maturing mortgage obligations by using a combination of cash flow and refinancing. The dividend payments were primarily made from cash flow from operations.\nCash flows used for capital improvements include amounts needed to meet environmental and regulatory requirements in connection with the manufactured home communities that provide water or sewer service. Excluding expansions and rental home purchases, the Company is budgeting approximately $16 million in capital improvements for 2019.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 43 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's significant commitments and contractual obligations relate to its mortgages and loans payable, acquisitions of manufactured home communities, retirement benefits, and the lease on its corporate offices as described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company has 1,700 acres of undeveloped land which it could develop over the next several years. The Company continues to analyze the best use of its vacant land.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had total assets of $879.0 million and total liabilities of $454.3 million. Our net debt (net of cash and cash equivalents) to total market capitalization as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was approximately 37% and 32%, respectively. Our net debt, less securities (net of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities) to total market capitalization as of December 30, 2018 and 2017 was approximately 28% and 20%, respectively.\nThe Company believes that it has the ability to meet its obligations and to generate funds for new investments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nThe Company has not executed any material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nThe following is a summary of the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1-3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n3-5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Mortgages Payable </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>334,411,425 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,140,538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,313,422 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,069,454 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>208,888,011 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest on Mortgages Payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80,803,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,374,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,182,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,435,598 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,811,559 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans Payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,417,479 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,767,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,593,603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,699,576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,357,022 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest on Loans Payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,009,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,445,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,977,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,704,610 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>882,131 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating Lease Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>729,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>214,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>441,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Purchase of Properties </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,287,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,287,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Retirement Benefits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>450,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>450,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>585,108,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105,228,903 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,507,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>151,983,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>261,388,723 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMortgages payable represents the principal amounts outstanding based on scheduled payments. The interest on these mortgages are at fixed rates ranging from 3.71% to 6.5%. The weighted average interest rate, not including the effect of unamortized debt issuance costs, was approximately 4.3% at December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the weighted average loan maturity of the mortgage payable is 6.3 years.\nLoans payable represents $50,000,000 outstanding on the Company's unsecured line of credit with an interest rate ranging from LIBOR plus 1.75% to 2.50% or Prime plus 0.75% to 1.50%, based on the Company's overall leverage (interest rate of 4.05% as of December 31, 2018); $31,975,086 outstanding on its margin line with an interest rate of 2.75% at December 31, 2018; $15,928,350 outstanding on the Company's revolving credit agreements to finance inventory with interest rates ranging from prime with a minimum of 6% to Prime plus 2% with a minimum of 8% after 18 months (weighted average interest rate of 7.04% as of December 31, 2018); $373,499 loans outstanding for the finance of rental homes with an interest rate of 6.99% at December 31, 2018; $3,779,477 outstanding on its commercial term loan with an interest rate of 4.625% at December 31, 2018; $4,000,000 outstanding on the Company's revolving line of credit secured by eligible notes receivables with an interest rate of prime plus 50 basis points (interest rate of 5.50 % as of December 31, 2018); and $2,361,066 outstanding on its automotive loans with a weighted average interest rate of 4.43%.\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 44 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating lease obligations represent a lease with a related party for the Company's corporate offices. On May 1, 2015, the Company renewed this lease for additional space and for an additional seven-year term with monthly lease payments of $14,900 through April 30, 2020 and $15,300 through April 30, 2022. On July 1, 2017, the Company entered into a lease for additional office space adjacent to its existing corporate office space requiring monthly lease payments of $1,275 through April 30, 2020 and $1,310 through April 30, 2022. On February 14, 2018, the Company entered into a lease for additional office space adjacent to its existing corporate office space requiring monthly lease payments of $1,800 through April 30, 2020 and $1,850 through April 30, 2022. The Company is also responsible for its proportionate share of real estate taxes and common area maintenance. Mr. Eugene W. Landy, the Founder and Chairman of the Board of the Company, owns a 24% interest in the entity that is the landlord of the property where the Company's corporate office space is located. Management believes that the aforesaid rent is no more than what the Company would pay for comparable space elsewhere.\nPurchase of Properties represents the total purchase price of two communities under contract, one in Ohio and one in Michigan, totaling 1,187 developed home sites.\nRetirement benefits of $450,000 represent the total future amount to be paid, on an undiscounted basis, relating to the Company's Founder and Chairman. These benefits are based upon his specific employment agreement. The agreement does not require the Company to separately fund the obligation and therefore will be paid from the general assets of the Company. The Company has accrued these benefits on a present value basis over the term of the agreement (See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Company's consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nSignificant accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgment and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. For a detailed description of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nReal Estate Investments\nThe Company applies Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 360-10, Property, Plant & Equipment ( ASC 360-10\u201d) to measure impairment in real estate investments. Rental properties are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future cash flows (on an undiscounted basis without interest) from a rental property is less than the carrying value under its historical net cost basis. These expected future cash flows consider factors such as future operating income, trends and prospects as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. Upon determination that an other than temporary impairment has occurred, rental properties are reduced to their fair value. For properties to be disposed of, an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the property, less the estimated cost to sell, is less than the carrying amount of the property measured at the time there is a commitment to sell the property and/or it is actively being marketed for sale. A property to be disposed of is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value, less its cost to sell. Subsequent to the date that a property is held for disposition, depreciation expense is not recorded.\nUpon acquisition of a property, the Company applies ASC 805, Business Combinations ( ASC 805\u201d) and allocates the purchase price of the property based upon the fair value of the assets acquired, which generally consist of land, site and land improvements, buildings and improvements and rental homes. The Company allocates the purchase price of an acquired property generally determined by internal evaluation as well as third-party appraisal of the property obtained in conjunction with the purchase.\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 45 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805), Clarifying the Definition of a Business\u201d. ASU 2017-01 seeks to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, intangible assets and consolidation. The adoption of ASU 2017-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. The amendments should be applied prospectively on or after the effective dates. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2017, on a prospective basis. The Company evaluated its acquisitions and has determined that its acquisitions of manufactured home communities during 2017 and 2018 should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets. As such, transaction costs, such as broker fees, transfer taxes, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional and consulting fees, related to acquisitions are capitalized as part of the cost of the acquisitions, which is then subject to a purchase price allocation based on relative fair value. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-01, the Company's acquisitions were considered an acquisition of a business and therefore, the acquisition costs were expensed.\nThe Company conducted a comprehensive review of all real estate asset classes in accordance with ASC 360-10-35-21, which indicates that asset values should be analyzed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable. The process entailed the analysis of property for instances where the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value. In accordance with ASC 360-10-35-17, an impairment loss shall be recognized if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The Company utilizes the experience and knowledge of its internal valuation team to derive certain assumptions used to determine an operating property's cash flow. Such assumptions include lease-up rates, rental rates, rental growth rates, and capital expenditures. The Company reviewed its operating properties in light of the requirements of ASC 360-10 and determined that, as of December 31, 2018, the undiscounted cash flows over the holding period for these properties were in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, no impairment charges were required.\nMarketable Securities\nInvestments in marketable securities consist of marketable common and preferred stock securities of other REITs, which the Company generally limits to no more than approximately 15% of its undepreciated assets. These marketable securities are all publicly-traded and purchased on the open market, through private transactions or through dividend reinvestment plans. The Company normally holds REIT securities on a long-term basis and has the ability and intent to hold securities to recovery, therefore as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, gains or losses on the sale of securities are based on average cost and are accounted for on a trade date basis.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\u201d. ASU 2016-01 requires changes in the fair value of our marketable securities to be recorded in current period earnings. Previously, changes in the fair value of marketable securities were recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\u201d on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As a result, on January 1, 2018 the Company recorded an increase to beginning undistributed income (accumulated deficit) of $11,519,582 to recognize the unrealized gains previously recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\u201d on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the Company's marketable securities are recorded in Other Investment Income (Loss), net\u201d on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). See Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\u201d below for additional information regarding the adoption of this ASU.\nOther\nEstimates are used when accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts for our rents and loans receivable, potentially excess and obsolete inventory and contingent liabilities, among others. These estimates are susceptible to change and actual results could differ from these estimates. The effects of changes in these estimates are recognized in the period they are determined.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- 46 - </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>", "summary": "The report discusses the achievements and operations of the company UMH.

The Company's primary business is the ownership and operation of manufactured home communities, which includes leasing manufactured home spaces on an annual or month-to-month basis to residential manufactured home owners. The Company also leases homes to residents and, through its taxable REIT subsidiary, S&F, sells and finances homes to residents and prospective residents of our communities.\nOur communities are located in New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Indiana, Michigan and Maryland. UMH has continued to execute our growth strategy of purchasing well-located communities in our target markets, including the energy-rich Marcellus and Utica Shale regions. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we purchased six manufactured home communities, for an aggregate purchase price of $59,093,000. These acquisitions added approximately 1,600 developed homesites to our portfolio, bringing our total to 118 communities containing approximately 21,500 developed homesites.\n - 33 - \n \nThe Company earns income from the operation of its manufactured home communities, leasing of manufactured homesites, the rental of manufactured homes, the sale and finance of manufactured homes, the brokering of home sales, and from appreciation in the values of the manufactured home communities and vacant land owned by the Company. Management views the Company as a single segment based on its method of internal reporting in addition to its allocation of capital and resources. The Company also invests in securities of other REITs which the Company generally limits to no more than approximately 15% of its undepreciated assets.\nOccupancy in our properties, as well as our ability to increase rental rates, directly affects revenues. In 2018, total income increased 15.0% from the prior year and Community NOI (as defined below) increased 12.8% from the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition and rental programs in 2017 and 2018. Overall occupancy increased from 81.4% at December 31, 2017 to 82.0% at December 31, 2018. Same property occupancy, which includes communities owned and operated as of January 1, 2017, increased from 82.6% at December 31, 2017 to 83.0% at December 31, 2018. Overall occupancy includes communities acquired in 2018 at a weighted average occupancy of 80%.\nSales of manufactured homes performed exceptionally well during 2018, increasing by 45% year-over-year. Demand for housing remains healthy, due to improvements in the economy, sustained wage and job growth and still favorable interest rates. Conventional single-family home prices continue their rise supported by low inventories and increasing sales. As household formation strengthens and for-sale inventory remains limited, a large share of housing demand will be looking at alternative forms of housing. Our property type offers substantial comparative value that should result in increased demand.\nThe macro-economic environment and current housing fundamentals continue to favor home rentals. The inability to satisfy down payment requirements, more stringent credit terms, and steadily increasing home prices continue to create hurdles for would-be homebuyers. Rental homes in a manufactured home community allow the resident to obtain the efficiencies of factory-built housing and the amenities of community living for less than the cost of other forms of affordable housing. We continue to see increased demand for rental homes. During 2018, our portfolio of rental homes increased by 905 homes. Occupied rental homes represent approximately 34.1% of total occupied sites. Occupancy in rental homes continues to be strong and is at 92.3% as of December 31, 2018. We compare favorably with other types of rental housing, including apartments, and we will continue to allocate capital to rental home purchases, as demand dictates.\nThe Company holds a portfolio of marketable securities of other REITs with a fair value of $99,595,736 at December 31, 2018, representing 9.3% of our undepreciated assets (total assets excluding accumulated depreciation). The Company generally limits its marketable securities investments to no more than approximately 15% of its undepreciated assets. The REIT securities portfolio provides the Company with additional diversification, liquidity and income, and serves as a proxy for real estate when more favorable risk adjusted returns are not available. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's portfolio consisted of 3% REIT preferred stocks and 97% REIT common stocks.\nThe Company invests in these REIT securities and, from time to time, may use margin debt when an adequate yield spread can be obtained. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has borrowings of $31,975,086 under its margin line at 2.75% interest. The Company's weighted average yield on the securities portfolio was approximately 7.3% at December 31, 2018. The Company realized a net gain of $20,107 on sale of securities in 2018 as compared to a net gain of $1,747,528 during 2017. At December 31, 2018, the Company had unrealized losses of $(40,155,814) in its REIT securities portfolio. The dividends received from our securities investments continue to meet our expectations. It is our intent to hold these securities for investment on a long-term basis.\nThe Company continues to strengthen its balance sheet. During 2018, the Company raised approximately $35.1 million in new capital through the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan ( DRIP\u201d). The Company also reduced its cost of capital in 2018 by issuing 2,000,000 shares of a new 6.375% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ( Series D Preferred Stock\u201d) for net proceeds of $48.2 million.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $7.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $25 million available on our credit facility, with an additional $50 million potentially available pursuant to an accordion feature. We also had $18.6 million available on our revolving lines of credit for the financing of home sales and the purchase of inventory. In addition, we held approximately $99.6 million in marketable REIT securities encumbered by $32.0 million in margin loans. In general, the Company may borrow up to 50% of the value of the marketable securities.\n - 34 - \n \nThe Company intends to continue to increase its real estate investments. Our business plan includes acquiring communities that yield in excess of our cost of funds and then making physical improvements, including adding rental homes onto otherwise vacant sites. In 2017 and 2018, we have added a total of seventeen manufactured home communities to our portfolio, encompassing approximately 3,600 developed sites. These manufactured home communities were acquired with an average occupancy rate of 71%. The Company will utilize the rental home program to increase occupancy rates and improve operating results at these communities. There is no guarantee that any additional opportunities will materialize or that the Company will be able to take advantage of such opportunities. The growth of our real estate portfolio depends on the availability of suitable properties which meet the Company's investment criteria and appropriate financing. Competition in the market areas in which the Company operates is significant and affects acquisitions, occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of certain properties.\nSee PART I, Item 1 - Business and Item 1A - Risk Factors for a more complete discussion of the economic and industry-wide factors relevant to the Company, the Company's lines of business and principal products and services, and the opportunities, challenges and risks on which the Company is focused.\nAcquisitions\n\n - 35 - \n \nSupplemental Measures\nIn addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include certain non-GAAP financial measures that in management's view of the business we believe are meaningful as they allow the investor the ability to understand key operating details of our business both with and without regard to certain accounting conventions or items that may not always be indicative of recurring annual cash flow of the portfolio. These non-GAAP financial measures as determined and presented by us may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies, and include Community Net Operating Income ( Community NOI\u201d), Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders ( FFO\u201d), Core Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders ( Core FFO\u201d) and Normalized Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders ( Normalized FFO\u201d).\nWe define Community NOI as rental and related income less community operating expenses such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, community salaries, utilities, insurance and other expenses. We believe that Community NOI is helpful to investors and analysts as a direct measure of the actual operating results of our manufactured home communities, rather than our Company overall. Community NOI should not be considered a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Community NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indicator of our financial performance, or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity; nor is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.\nThe Company's Community NOI is calculated as follows:\n\nWe also assess and measure our overall operating results based upon an industry performance measure referred to as FFO, which management believes is a useful indicator of our operating performance. FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of a REIT. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders, as defined by GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined under GAAP, gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization. NAREIT created FFO as a non-GAAP supplemental measure of REIT operating performance. We define Core FFO as FFO , excluding acquisition costs, costs of early extinguishment of debt, change in the fair value of marketable securities and costs associated with the redemption of preferred stock. We define Normalized FFO as Core FFO excluding gains and losses realized on securities investments and certain non-recurring charges. FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO should be considered as supplemental measures of operating performance used by REITs. FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO exclude historical cost depreciation as an expense and may facilitate the comparison of REITs which have a different cost basis. The items excluded from FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO are significant components in understanding the Company's financial performance.\nFFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO (i) do not represent Cash Flow from Operations as defined by GAAP; (ii) should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and (iii) are not alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO, as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other REITs.\n - 36 - \n \nThe Company's FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO attributable to common shareholders are calculated as follows:\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nStatements contained in this Form 10-K, that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d).

We have:\n \u25cf Generated a 12% increase in Normalized FFO per share; \u25cf Increased Rental and Related Income by 12%; \u25cf Increased Community Net Operating Income ( NOI\u201d) by 13%; \u25cf Improved our Operating Expense ratio by 50 basis points to 46.5%; \u25cf Increased Same Property NOI by 7%; \u25cf Increased Same Property Occupancy by 40 basis points from 82.6% to 83.0%; \u25cf Increased home sales by 45%; \u25cf Acquired 6 communities containing approximately 1,600 homesites for a total cost of $59.1 million, bringing our total property portfolio to 118 manufactured home communities with approximately 21,500 developed homesites; \u25cf Increased our rental home portfolio by 905 homes to approximately 6,500 total rental homes, representing an increase of 16%; \u25cf Expanded and extended our existing unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing the available borrowings and reducing interest costs. \u25cf Issued 2,000,000 shares of a new 6.375% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, for net proceeds after deducting the underwriting discount and other estimated offering expenses, of approximately $48 million; and \u25cf Raised $35.1 million through our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. \nOverview\nThe following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data\u201d and the historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nThe Company is a self-administered, self-managed, REIT with headquarters in Freehold, New Jersey. The Company's primary business is the ownership and operation of manufactured home communities, which includes leasing manufactured home spaces on an annual or month-to-month basis to residential manufactured home owners. The Company also leases homes to residents and, through its taxable REIT subsidiary, S&F, sells and finances homes to residents and prospective residents of our communities.\nOur communities are located in New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Indiana, Michigan and Maryland. UMH has continued to execute our growth strategy of purchasing well-located communities in our target markets, including the energy-rich Marcellus and Utica Shale regions. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we purchased six manufactured home communities, for an aggregate purchase price of $59,093,000.

Management views the Company as a single segment based on its method of internal reporting in addition to its allocation of capital and resources. The Company also invests in securities of other REITs which the Company generally limits to no more than approximately 15% of its undepreciated assets.\nOccupancy in our properties, as well as our ability to increase rental rates, directly affects revenues. In 2018, total income increased 15.0% from the prior year and Community NOI (as defined below) increased 12.8% from the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition and rental programs in 2017 and 2018.

\nSupplemental Measures\nIn addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include certain non-GAAP financial measures that in management's view of the business we believe are meaningful as they allow the investor the ability to understand key operating details of our business both with and without regard to certain accounting conventions or items that may not always be indicative of recurring annual cash flow of the portfolio. These non-GAAP financial measures as determined and presented by us may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies, and include Community Net Operating Income ( Community NOI\u201d), Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders ( FFO\u201d), Core Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders ( Core FFO\u201d) and Normalized Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders ( Normalized FFO\u201d).\nWe define Community NOI as rental and related income less community operating expenses such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, community salaries, utilities, insurance and other expenses. We believe that Community NOI is helpful to investors and analysts as a direct measure of the actual operating results of our manufactured home communities, rather than our Company overall. Community NOI should not be considered a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Community NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indicator of our financial performance, or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity; nor is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.\nThe Company's Community NOI is calculated as follows:\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Rental and Related Income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113,832,660 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,801,425 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90,679,557 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74,762,548 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,886,010 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Community Operating Expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52,948,510 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47,846,565 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42,638,333 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37,049,462 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,592,327 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Community NOI </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,884,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,954,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,041,224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,713,086 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,293,683 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe also assess and measure our overall operating results based upon an industry performance measure referred to as FFO, which management believes is a useful indicator of our operating performance. FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of a REIT. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders, as defined by GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined under GAAP, gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization. NAREIT created FFO as a non-GAAP supplemental measure of REIT operating performance. We define Core FFO as FFO , excluding acquisition costs, costs of early extinguishment of debt, change in the fair value of marketable securities and costs associated with the redemption of preferred stock. We define Normalized FFO as Core FFO excluding gains and losses realized on securities investments and certain non-recurring charges. FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO should be considered as supplemental measures of operating performance used by REITs. FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO exclude historical cost depreciation as an expense and may facilitate the comparison of REITs which have a different cost basis. The items excluded from FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO are significant components in understanding the Company's financial performance.\nFFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO (i) do not represent Cash Flow from Operations as defined by GAAP; (ii) should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and (iii) are not alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO, as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other REITs.\n - 36 - \n \nThe Company's FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO
