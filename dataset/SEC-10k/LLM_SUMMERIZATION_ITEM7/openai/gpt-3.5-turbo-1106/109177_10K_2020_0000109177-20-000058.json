MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is management's discussion of the financial results, liquidity and other key items related to our performance and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following is a combined report of SBH and SB/RH, and the following discussion includes SBH and certain matters related to SB/RH as signified below. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the Company,\u201d we,\u201d our\u201d or us\u201d are used to refer to SBH and its subsidiaries and SB/RH and its subsidiaries, collectively\nBusiness Overview\nThe following section provides a general description of our business as well as recent developments for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, which we believe are important to understanding our results of operations, financial condition, and understanding anticipated future trends. Refer to Item 1 - Business and Note 1 - Description of Business in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report for an overview of our business. For a discussion of our fiscal 2018 results, please refer to Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019 filed with the SEC on November 15, 2019.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting regulations and other disruptions to both demand and supply may have a substantial impact on the commercial operations of the Company or impairment of the Company's net assets. Such impacts may include, but are not limited to, volatility of demand for our products, disruptions and cost implications in manufacturing and supply arrangements, inability of third parties to meet obligations under existing arrangements, and significant changes to the political and economic environments in which we manufacture, sell, and distribute our products.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2020 and as of the date of this report, we have been and continue to be classified as an essential business in the jurisdictions that have mandated closures of non-essential businesses, and therefore have been allowed to remain open. The Company did experience temporary shutdowns at certain operating facilities in response to government mandated restrictions or to address and implement preventative safety measures. During the second quarter ended March 29, 2020, there were certain HHI operating facilities, primarily within China and the Philippines, that experienced a temporary limit on production in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, but such facilities were operating at or near full capacity by the end of the second quarter. Subsequently, during the third quarter ended June 28, 2020, additional governmental operating restrictions were announced in Mexico temporarily suspending or limiting production for our HHI operating facilities, with facilities operating and ramping up productions by the end of the third quarter. Moreover, our H&G facility in St. Louis was temporarily closed in April 2020 to provide for additional cleaning and implementation of preventative measures in response to confirmed cases of COVID-19. These facilities continue to operate to the extent possible under existing regulations and may be subject to future closure depending upon unforeseeable duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and any governmental and public action.\nDespite the supply implications, the Company continued to experience strong customer demand. While demand in general for our products remains strong, our teams continue to monitor demand disruption and there can be no assurance as to the level of demand that will prevail following the year ended September 30, 2020. A large portion of our customers continue to operate and sell our products, with some customers reducing operations during the year ended September 30, 2020 due to closures or reduced store hours. The Company has experienced both positive and negative consumer behavior which may or may not continue. There have also been changes in consumer needs and spending during the COVID-19 pandemic, which have resulted in a limited number of change orders and reduced spending. Currently, we have not identified, and will continue to monitor for, any substantive risk attributable to customer credit and have not experienced a significant impact from permanent store closures or retail bankruptcies. We believe the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic to be uncertain and we expect it to continue to contribute to retail volatility and consumer purchase behavior changes. The magnitude of the financial impact on our results is highly dependent on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and how quickly the U.S. and global economies resume normal operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has not, as of the date of this report, had a materially negative impact on the Company's liquidity position. The sweeping nature of COVID-19 pandemic makes it extremely difficult to predict the long-term ramifications on our financial condition and results of operations. However, the likely overall economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is viewed as highly negative to the U.S. and global economies. During the year ended September 30, 2020, we have implemented mitigating efforts to manage non-critical capital spending, assess operating spend, preserve cash and liquidity. We continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs, and we expect to maintain access to the capital markets, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. We have also not observed any material impairments of our assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe expect the ultimate significance of the impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be dictated by the length of time that such circumstances continue, which will ultimately depend on the unforeseeable duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, any governmental and public actions taken in response and any related economic disruption.\nAcquisitions\nOn March 10, 2020, the Company aquired Omega Sea, LLC (\"Omega\"), a manufacturer and marketer of premium fish foods and consumable goods for the home and commercial aquarium markets, primarily consisting of the Omega brand, for a purchase price of approximately $16.9 million. The results of Omega's operations since March 10, 2020 are included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and reported within the GPC reporting segment for the year ended September 30, 2020. See Note 4 - Acquisitions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information.\nDivestitures\n\u2022Coevorden Operations - On March 29, 2020, the Company completed the sale of its DCF production facility and distribution center in Coevorden, Netherlands for cash proceeds of $29.0 million subject to working capital and other typical closing adjustments, resulting in a loss on assets held for sale of $26.8 million during the year ended September 30, 2020. The loss was recognized as a component of continuing operations and operating income within the Company's GPC segment.\n\u2022Global Batteries & Lighting ( GBL\u201d) - On January 2, 2019, the Company completed the sale of its GBL business pursuant to the GBL acquisition agreement with Energizer for cash proceeds of $1,956.2 million, resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax gain on sale of $989.8 million, including the estimated settlement of customary purchase price adjustments for working capital and assumed indebtedness, recognition of tax and legal indemnifications under the acquisition agreement and an estimated contingent purchase price adjustment for the settlement with the planned divestiture of the Varta\u00ae consumer batteries business by Energizer of $200.0 million in accordance with the GBL acquisition agreement. The results of operations and gain on sale for disposal of the GBL business are recognized as a component of discontinued operations.\n\u2022Global Auto Care ( GAC\u201d) - On January 28, 2019, the Company completed the sale of its GAC business pursuant to the GAC acquisition agreement with Energizer for $1.2 billion, consisting of $938.7 million in cash proceeds and $242.1 million in stock consideration of common stock of Energizer, resulting in the write-down of net assets held for sale of $111.0 million, including the estimated settlement of customary purchase price adjustments for working capital and assumed indebtedness, recognition of tax and legal indemnifications in accordance with the GAC acquisition agreement. Unrealized gains and losses realized for changes in the fair value of the Company's common stock investment in Energizer are recognized as Other Non-Operating Expense (Income), net on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income. The results of operations and write-down of net assets held for sale for the disposal of the GAC business are recognized as a component of discontinued operations.\n\u2022Home and Personal Care ( HPC\u201d) - During the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company initiated a plan to sell its GBA segment, consisting of its GBL business and HPC business, and classified the GBA operations as held for sale and discontinued operations. During the first quarter ended December 30, 2018, the Company changed its plans to sell its HPC business and classified the net assets of HPC as held for use and the HPC operations have been classified as continuing operations for all periods presented. During the period in which the HPC business was held for sale, the Company incurred divestiture related expenses to market and sell the business that were previously recognized as a component of discontinued operations and ceased the recognition of depreciation and amortization on long-lived assets of the HPC disposal group, impacting the comparability of financial results when classified as continuing operations, resulting in the recognition of $29.0 million in incremental depreciation and amortization charges during the year ended September 30, 2019.\nSee Note 3 - Divestitures in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further discussion pertaining to the divestitures.\nRestructuring Activity\nWe continually seek to improve our operational efficiency, match our manufacturing capacity and product costs to market demand and better utilize our manufacturing resources. We have undertaken various initiatives to reduce manufacturing and operating costs, which may have a significant impact on the comparability of financial results on the consolidated financial statements. The most significant of these initiatives is the Global Productivity Improvement Program, which began during the year ended September 30, 2019. See Note 5 - Restructuring and Related Charges in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further discussion pertaining to restructuring and related activity.\nRefinancing Activity\nThe following recent financing activity has a significant impact on the comparability of financial results on the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company (1) entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\"), which refinanced the Company's previously existing credit facility, extending the maturity, reducing the revolving facility under the Credit Agreement from $890 million to $600 million, and changing interest rate margins; (2) issued $300 million of its 5.50% Senior Unsecured Notes; and (3) completed the tender and call of its 6.625% Notes with an outstanding principal of $117.4 million initiated at the end of the year ended September 30, 2019.\n\u2022During the year ended September 30, 2019, the Company (1) repaid $452.6 million of its 6.625% Notes with an outstanding principal of $570.0 million, consisting of a repayment of $285.0 million on March 31, 2019 plus a repayment of $167.6 million on September 24, 2019 using proceeds from the GAC divestitures; (2) issued $300.0 million of 5.00% Senior Unsecured Notes due September 2029; (3) repaid its 7.75% Senior Unsecured Notes in full on January 30, 2019 using proceeds received from the GBL and GAC divestitures; (4) repaid its USD Term Loan in full on January 4, 2019 using proceeds received from the divestiture of GBL; and (5) repaid its CAD Term Loan in full on October 31, 2018.\nSee Note 12 - Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for additional detail regarding debt and refinancing activity.\nSalus CLO\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2020, the non-recourse debt under Salus CLO were effectively discharged resulting in the recognition of a non-cash gain on extinguishment of debt of $76.2 million. See Note 12 - Debt in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information.\nAdoption of New Lease Accounting Standard\nOn October 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and all the related amendments using the modified retrospective transition method, which resulted in the recognition of additional right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) lease assets of $107.5 million and additional lease liabilities of $113.0 million, with no material cumulative effect adjustment to equity as of the date of adoption. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. See Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies and Practices and Note 13 - Leases in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information.\nSubsequent Event\nOn October 26, 2020, the Company acquired Armitage Pet Care Ltd (\"Armitage\") for approximately $187 million. Located in Nottingham, United Kingdom, Armitage is a premium provider of pet treats and toys including a portfolio of brands that includes dog treats brand, Good Boy\u00ae, and cat treats brand, Meowee!\u00ae, among others, that are predominantly sold within the United Kingdom. The net assets and operating results of Armitage will be included in the financial statements subsequent to the balance sheet date of September 30, 2020 and included within the GPC reporting segment for all subsequent periods.\nNon-GAAP Measurements\nOur consolidated and segment results contain non-GAAP metrics such as organic net sales, and Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization). While we believe organic net sales and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace our financial results in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results.\nOrganic Net Sales. We define organic net sales as net sales excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and/or impact from acquisitions (where applicable). We believe this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rate and/or acquisitions. We use organic net sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and segment performance. Organic growth is calculated by comparing organic net sales to net sales in the prior year. The effect of changes in currency exchange rates is determined by translating the period's net sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior comparative period. Net sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination. We exclude net sales from acquired businesses in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. The following is a reconciliation of net sales to organic net sales of SBH and SB/RH for the year ended September 30, 2020 compared to net sales for the year ended September 30, 2019:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>September 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Sales September 30, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except %) </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Effect of Changes in Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Net Sales Excluding Effect of Changes in Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Effect of Acquisitions\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Organic\nNet Sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HHI\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,342.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,342.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,342.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,355.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13.2) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.0 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HPC\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,107.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,126.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,126.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,068.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GPC\n</td> <td> </td> <td>962.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>963.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>956.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>870.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>9.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>H&G\n</td> <td> </td> <td>551.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>552.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>552.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>508.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,964.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,984.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,977.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,802.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>175.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP metric used by management that we believe provides useful information to investors because it reflects the ongoing operating performance and trends of our segments, excluding certain non-cash based expenses and/or non-recurring items during each of the comparable periods. It also facilitates comparisons between peer companies since interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies. Adjusted EBITDA is also used for determining compliance with the Company's debt covenants. See Note 12 - Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for additional detail.\nEBITDA is calculated by excluding the Company's income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation expense and amortization expense (from intangible assets) from net income. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes:\n\u2022Stock based and other incentive compensation costs that consist of costs associated with long-term compensation arrangements and other equity based compensation based upon achievement of long-term performance metrics; and generally consist of non-cash, stock-based compensation. See Note 19 - Share Based Compensation in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further details. Additionally, the Company issued certain incentive bridge awards due to changes in the Company's long-term compensation plans that allow for cash based payment upon employee election which have been included in the adjustment but do not qualify for shared-based compensation.;\n\u2022Restructuring and related charges, which consist of project costs associated with the restructuring initiatives across the Company's segments. See Note 5 - Restructuring and Related Charges in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further details;\n\u2022Transaction related charges that consist of (1) transaction costs from qualifying acquisition transactions during the period, or subsequent integration related project costs directly associated with an acquired business; and (2) divestiture related transaction costs that are recognized in continuing operations and post-divestiture separation costs consisting of incremental costs to facilitate separation of shared operations, including development of transferred shared service operations, platforms and personnel transferred as part of the divestitures and exiting of transition service arrangements (TSAs) and reverse TSAs. See Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies and Practices in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further details;\n\u2022Gains and losses attributable to the Company's investment in Energizer common stock, acquired as part of consideration received from the Company's sale and divestiture of GAC during the year ended September 30, 2019. See Note 3 - Divestitures and Note 7 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further details;\n\u2022Non-cash asset impairments or write-offs realized and recognized in earnings from continuing operations (when applicable);\n\u2022Non-cash purchase accounting inventory adjustments recognized in earnings from continuing operations after an acquisition (when applicable);\n\u2022Foreign currency gains and losses attributable to multicurrency loans for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, that were entered into with foreign subsidiaries in exchange for the receipt of divestiture proceeds by the parent company and the distribution of the respective foreign subsidiaries' net assets as part of the GBL and GAC divestitures. The Company has entered into various hedging arrangements to mitigate the volatility of foreign exchange risk associated with such loans;\n\u2022Incremental reserves associated with environmental remediation activity of legacy properties and former manufacturing sites assumed by the organization which had previously been exited by the Company, plus legal settlement costs associated with retained litigation from the Company's divested GAC operations realized during the year ended September 30, 2019. See Note 20 - Commitments and Contingencies in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion;\n\u2022Legal and litigation costs associated with Salus during the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 as it is not considered a component of the continuing commercial products company, but continues to be consolidated by the Company after completion of the Spectrum Merger until the Salus operations can be wholly dissolved and/or deconsolidated;\n\u2022Gain on extinguishment of the Salus CLO debt due to the discharge of the obligation during the year ended September 30, 2020. See Note 12 - Debt in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further details; and\n\u2022Other adjustments primarily consisting of costs attributable to (1) expenses and cost recovery for flood damage at the Company's facilities in Middleton, Wisconsin recognized during the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019; (2) incremental costs for separation of a key executives during the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019; (3) incremental costs associated with a safety recall in GPC during the year ended September 30, 2019; (4) operating margin on H&G sales to GAC discontinued operations during the year ended September 30, 2019; and (5) certain fines and penalties for delayed shipments following the completion of a GPC distribution center consolidation in EMEA during the year ended September 30, 2019.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 for SBH:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SPECTRUM BRANDS HOLDINGS, INC.

Gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2020 increased $63.0 million with an increase in gross profit margin from 34.4% to 34.6% primarily due to increased sales volume with incremental product and input costs including tariffs, offset by productivity, favorable product mix and pricing adjustments.\nOperating Expenses. Operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2020 decreased $108.2 million, or 8.8%, due to the impairment of HPC goodwill of $116.0 million and impairment of intangible assets of $35.4 million in the prior year with offsets by the recognition of loss on assets held for sale of $26.8 million and impairment of intangible assets of $24.2 million associated with the Coevorden Operations divestiture. Additionally, the Company recognized a decrease in restructuring and related charges of $4.6 million and a decrease in selling and general and administrative expenses of $2.8 million primarily from higher depreciation and amortization in the prior year associated with HPC business being de-recognized from held for sale offest by increased marketing and advertising spend. See Note 5 - Restructuring and Related Charges in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further discussion pertaining to restructuring and related activity.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2020 decreased $77.6 million, or 34.9%, due to lower borrowings and average interest rates during the period attributable to refinancing activities. See Note 12 - Debt in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOther Non-Operating Expense, Net. Other non-operating expense for the year ended September 30, 2020 decreased $24.2 million primarily due to foreign currency losses in the prior year related to multicurrency loans with foreign subsidiaries associated with the GBL and GAC divestitures.\nIncome Taxes. The effective tax rate was 45.6% for the year ended September 30, 2020 compared to 3.7% for the year ended September 30, 2019. Our effective tax rate for the year ended September 30, 2020 was significantly impacted by income earned outside the U.S. that is subject to U.S. tax including the U.S. tax on global intangible low taxed income, losses that more likely than not will not result in tax benefits, certain nondeductible expenses, an increase to state deferred tax rates, and foreign rates that differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate.\nSee Note 16 - Income Taxes in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional detail.\nIncome From Discontinued Operations. Discontinued operations includes the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the GBL and GAC divisions sold during the year ended September 30, 2019, effective January 2, 2019 and January 28, 2019, respectively. During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company recognized a $10.5 million tax benefit to discontinued operations from the return to provision adjustments related to the divestitures of GBL, primarily from changes to US GILTI on the non-US portions of the sold business, in addition to other adjustments to tax indemnifications following the GBL and GAC divestitures. See Note 3 - Divestitures in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on the divestitures and the assets and liabilities classified as held for sale.\nNoncontrolling Interest. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interest reflects the share of the net income of our subsidiaries, which are not wholly-owned, attributable to the accounting interest. Such amount varies in relation to such subsidiary's net income or loss for the period and the percentage interest not owned by SBH.\nSB/RH\nThe following is summarized consolidated results of operations for SB/RH for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended September 30,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except %)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,964.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,802.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>162.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,369.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,306.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,119.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,229.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(110.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.0 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>144.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.1 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-operating expense, net </td> <td> </td> <td>19.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55.4 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td>58.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>443.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) from continuing operations </td> <td> </td> <td>28.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(139.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>168.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(120.4 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from discontinued operations, net of tax </td> <td> </td> <td>14.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>682.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(668.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(97.9 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>42.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>542.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(500.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(92.2 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended September 30, 2020, the change in net sales, gross profit, operating expenses and other non-operating expenses are primarily attributable to changes in SBH previously discussed.

Our effective tax rate for the year ended September 30, 2020 was significantly impacted by income earned outside the U.S. that is subject to U.S. tax including the U. S. tax on global intangible low taxed income, losses that more likely than not will not result in tax benefits, certain nondeductible expenses, an increase to state deferred tax rates, and foreign rates that differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate.\nIncome from discontinued operations is attributable to SBH previously discussed.\nSegment Financial Data\nThis section provides an analysis of our results of reportable segments for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019.

This section also provides a discussion of our contractual operations and other commercial commitments as well as our ability to fund future commitments and operating activities through sources of capital as of September 30, 2020.\nThe following is a summary of the Company's net cash flows from continuing operations for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>SBH\n</td> <td> </td> <td>SB/RH\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>290.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>97.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,802.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,802.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(497.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,722.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(285.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,694.2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows from operating activities\nCash flows from SBH continuing operations increased $206.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 due to:\n\u2022Increase in cash provided by continuing operations of $153.6 million, with an increase in cash provided by working capital of $110.0 million mainly primarily attributable to timing of accounts payable;\n\u2022Decrease in cash paid for interest of $81.0 million from debt repayment activity in the prior year; offset by\n\u2022Increase in net corporate expenditures of $13.4 million;\n\u2022Increase in cash paid for restructuring and integration related activities of $26.2 million;\n\u2022Decrease in cash paid for income taxes of $11.8 million;\nCash flows from operating activities from continuing operations of SB/RH decreased $17.2 million during the year ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to the items discussed above except for an incremental operating cash outflow to its parent company for federal net operating losses under the Company's tax sharing agreement.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the Company was $148.5 million and $180.8 million for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in depreciation and amortization is primarily attributable to the cumulative adjustment to depreciation and amortization from the change in plan to sell the HPC division in the prior year.\nCash flows from investing activities\nCash flows from investing activities from SBH continuing operations decreased $2,694.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 primarily due the cash receipts attributable to the divestitures of GBL and GAC in the prior year of $1,924.1 million and $935.4 million, respectively; offset by the cash proceeds received from the Coevorden Operations divestiture of $29.0 million and proceeds from the sale of Energizer common stock investment of $147.1 million, net cash used for business acquisition of Omega for $16.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. Cash flows from investing activities from SB/RH continuing operations increased $2,694.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to the SBH items discussed above.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for SBH totaled $61.0 million and $58.4 million for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect to make incremental investments in capital projects slightly above historical experience related to investment in high return cost reduction projects and related restructuring initiatives. Capital expenditures of SB/RH are consistent with those of SBH.\nEnergizer Investment\nAs part of the consideration received for the GAC divestiture, the Company received 5.3 million shares of Energizer common stock, valued at $242.1 million on the effective close date of the GAC divestiture. During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company sold 3.6 million shares of Energizer common stock for proceeds of $147.1 million. As of September 30, 2020, the company holds 1.7 million shares of Energizer common stock, valued at $66.9 million. The Company may dispose of additional shares of Energizer common stock from time to time and use proceeds toward high return projects or investments.\nCash flows from financing activities\nCash flows used by financing activities for SBH continuing operations decreased $2,225.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 due to the debt repayment activity in the prior year following the GBL and GAC divestitures, offset by the payment of the Varta contingent payment to Energizer subsequent to the GBL divestiture and incremental treasury share repurchase activity. Cash flows used by financing activities for SB/RH continuing operations decreased $2,408.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 due to the debt repayment activity in the prior year following the GBL and GAC divestitures, offset by the payment of the Varta contingent payment to Energizer subsequent to the GBL divestiture.\nDebt\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2020, SBH recognized net proceeds of $300.0 million from the issuance of 5.50% Notes. The proceeds from the issuance of the 5.50% Notes were used for repayment of the Revolver Facility obligation. The Company made $135.5 million payment on debts for the outstanding balance of 6.625% Notes of $117.4 million with premium of early extinguishment of $1.3 million, and other debt payments of $16.8 million.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2019, the Company made $2,649.9 million of payment on debts, including the redemption of the USD Term Loans of $1,231.7 million, 7.75% Notes of $890.0 million with a premium on extinguishment of $26.4 million, partial paydown of 6.625% Notes of $452.6 million with payment of early extinguishment of $9.2 million, CAD Term Loan of $32.6 million, and other debt payments of $16.6 million. During the year ended September 30, 2019, the Company recognized incremental proceed from the issuance of debt due to the issuance of $300 million of 5.00% Senior Notes.\nIn addition to the outstanding principal on our debt obligations, we have annual interest payment obligations of approximately $124.5 million in the aggregate and includes interest under our: (i) 4.00% Notes of approximately $20.0 million; (ii) 6.125% Notes of approximately $15.3 million; (iii) 5.75% Notes of $57.5 million; (iv) 5.0% Notes of approximately $15.0 million; (v) 5.50% Notes of approximately $16.5 million. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears and interest under the Revolver Facility is payable on various interest payment dates as provided in the Senior Credit Agreement.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company entered into the Credit Agreement, which refinanced the Company's previously existing credit facility, reduced the revolving facility under the Credit Agreement from $890 million to $600 million and extended the Credit Agreement's maturity date to June 30, 2025. The Company may borrow funds at a variable interest rate. As a result of borrowings and payments under the Revolver Facility, at September 30, 2020, the Company had borrowing availability of $579.3 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $20.7 million. Certain fees are required to be paid in connection with our outstanding debt obligations including a quarterly commitment fee of up to 0.45% on the unused portion of the Revolver Facility and certain additional fees with respect to the letter of credit sub-facility under the Revolver Facility.\nAt September 30, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Credit Agreement and the indentures governing the 5.50% Notes, 6.125% Notes, 5.75% Notes, 5.00% Notes, and 4.00% Notes.\nThe Company's access to capital markets and financing costs may depend on the Company's credit ratings. On March 26, 2020, S&P downgraded the Company's corporate credit rating to \u2018B' from \u2018B+', senior secured debt ratings to \u2018BB-\u2018 from \u2018BB' and senior unsecured debt to \u2018B' from \u2018B+' , with a negative outlook in response to the changing economic environment and risks attributable to COVID-19. The Company's credit ratings and outlook with Moody's and Fitch remain unchanged. None of the Company's current borrowings are subject to default or acceleration as a result of a downgrading of credit ratings, although a downgrade of the Company's credit ratings could increase fees and interest charges on future borrowings. The Company believes that its current credit arrangements are sound and that the strength of its balance sheet affords the company the financial flexibility, including through access to financial markets for potential new financing, to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions. None of the Company's current borrowings are subject to default or acceleration as a result of a downgrading of credit ratings, although a downgrade of the Company's credit ratings could increase fees and interest charges on future financings. Refer to Note 12 - Debt of Notes in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.\nEquity\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, SBH did not issue additional shares of common stock other than pursuant to the Company's share-based compensation plans. SBH made cash dividend payments of $75.2 million and $85.5 million, or $0.42 per share, during the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFrom time to time, SBH will repurchase outstanding shares common stock in the open market or otherwise. During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company repurchased $355.6 million or 6.1 million shares as part of its $1 billion common stock repurchase program, including $125.0 million through an accelerated share repurchase. During the year ended September 30, 2019, the Company repurchased $250.0 million or 4.6 million shares.\nThe Company issues share based awards to our employees and our directors as a component of their compensation. All vesting is subject to the recipient's continued employment, except as otherwise permitted by our Compensation Committee or Board of Directors or in certain cases if the employee is terminated without cause or as otherwise provided in an applicable employment agreement. See Note 19 - Share Based Compensation of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information. During the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 the Company paid $12.6 million and $4.4 million, respectively, in tax withholding payments on share based compensation plans, net of proceeds received upon vesting.\nLiquidity Outlook\nThe Company's ability to make principal and interest payments on its senior notes and borrowings under its U.S. and foreign credit facilities and its ability to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on its ability to generate cash in the future, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other conditions. Based on its current level of operations, the Company believes that its existing cash balances and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet its operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, the Company may request borrowings under its credit facilities and seek alternative forms of financing or additional investments to achieve its longer-term strategic plans. At September 30, 2020, we believe there is approximately $75-$100 million of foreign cash available for repatriation.\nBecause the COVID-19 pandemic has not, as of the date of this report, materially impacted our operations or demand for our products, it has not had a materially negative impact on the Company's liquidity position. We have initiated mitigating efforts to manage non-critical capital spending, assess operating spend, preserve cash and improve liquidity. Additionally we temporarily suspended treasury repurchase activity. We continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs, and we expect to maintain access to the capital markets although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\nContractual Obligations & Other Commercial Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2020 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods:\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Contractual Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1 to 3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td>3 to 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt, excluding finance lease obligations(1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,352.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,250.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,099.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments excluding finance lease obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>649.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>124.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>248.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>225.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance lease obligations(2) </td> <td> </td> <td>253.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations(2) </td> <td> </td> <td>130.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee benefit obligations(3) </td> <td> </td> <td>100.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other obligations(4) </td> <td> </td> <td>17.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit(5) </td> <td> </td> <td>20.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Contractual Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,526.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>206.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>349.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,572.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,397.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) See Note 12 - Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in the Annual Report.\n(2) Finance and operating lease payments due by fiscal year include executory costs and imputed interest not reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

See Note 15 - Employee Benefit Plans of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n(4) Other obligations include the mandatory repatriation liability of $6.6 million payable over 8 years, recognized as Other Long-Term Liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of September 30, 2020. The remaining balance due is net of refundable tax credits and overpayments that must be applied to the mandatory repatriation tax installments, and due to the credits and overpayments, the Company does not expect to make an additional payment for mandatory repatriation until Fiscal 2025. See Note 16 - Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n(5) Standby letters of credit that back the performance of our entities under various credit facilities, insurance policies and lease arrangements.\nAt September 30, 2020, our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position includes reserves for uncertain tax positions. However, it is not possible to predict or estimate the amount and timing of payments for uncertain tax positions and those liabilities have been excluded from the obligations above. The Company cannot reasonably predict the ultimate outcome of income tax audits currently in progress for certain of our companies; however, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months, some portion of our unrecognized tax benefits could be recognized. See Note 16 - Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nAdditionally, other payables associated with indemnifications following the divestitures of GBL and GAC, including tax indemnifications, are not included as we cannot reasonably predict the ultimate outcome of our obligation; however it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months, some portion of our indemnification payable could be recognized. As of September 30, 2020, there are $33.0 million of indemnification liabilities to Energizer recognized as current and $17.2 million recognized as Other Long-Term Liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. See Note 3 - Divestitures of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nGuarantor Statements - SB/RH\nSBI has issued the 5.00% Notes under the 2029 Indenture, the 5.50% Notes under the 2030 Indenture, the 6.125% Notes under the 2024 Indenture, the 5.75% Notes under the 2025 Indenture, and the 4.00% Notes under the 2026 Indenture (collectively, the Notes\u201d). The Notes are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by SB/RH and SBI's domestic subsidiaries. The Notes and the related guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all of SBI and the guarantors' existing and future senior indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment to all of SBI and the guarantors' future indebtedness that expressively provide for its subordination to the Notes and the related guarantees. Non-guarantor subsidiaries primarily consist of SBI's foreign subsidiaries.\nThe following financial information consists of summarized financial information of the Obligor, presented on a combined basis. The Obligor\u201d consists of the financial statements of SBI as the debt issuer, SB/RH as a parent guarantor, and the domestic subsidiaries of SBI as subsidiary guarantors. Intercompany balances and transactions between SBI and the guarantors have been eliminated. Investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries and the earnings or losses from those non-guarantor subsidiaries have been excluded.\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement of Operations Data\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,868.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intercompany net sales to non-guarantor subsidiaries </td> <td> </td> <td>63.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>2,932.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>938.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td> </td> <td>187.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss from continuing operations </td> <td> </td> <td>(46.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>(32.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss attributable to controlling interest </td> <td> </td> <td>(32.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement of Financial Position Data </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,342.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncurrent Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>2,804.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current Liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td>881.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncurrent Liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td>3,020.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Obligor's amounts due from, due to the non-guarantor subsidiaries as of September 30, 2020 are as follows:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement of Financial Position Data\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current receivables from non-guarantor subsidiaries\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>161.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries\n</td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries\n</td> <td> </td> <td>368.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt with non-guarantor subsidiaries\n</td> <td> </td> <td>212.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and fairly present our financial position and results of operations. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. The following section identifies and summarizes those accounting policies considered by management to be the most critical to understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The application of these accounting policies requires judgment and use of assumptions as to future events and outcomes that are uncertain and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Refer to Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies and Practices of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for all relevant accounting policies.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company's goodwill, intangible assets and tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost, net of depreciation and amortization, less any provision for impairment. Intangible and tangible assets with determinable lives are amortized or depreciated on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives. Refer to Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies and Practices of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about useful lives.\nOn an annual basis, during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value to determine if potential goodwill impairment exists. Our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments. See Note 21 - Segment Information of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of operating and reporting segments.\nIf the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit goodwill and its carrying value. The estimated fair value represents the amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arms-length basis. In estimating the fair value of the reporting unit, we used a discounted cash flows methodology, which requires us to estimate future revenues, expenses, and capital expenditures and make assumptions about our weighted average cost of capital and perpetuity growth rate, among other variables. We test the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units by comparison to our total market capitalization, including both equity and debt capital. The fair value of HHI, GPC, and H&G reporting units exceeded their carrying value by 32%, 52%, and 134%, respectively, and did not recognize an impairment or deem the respective reporting units as \u2018at risk' of impairment.\nIn addition to goodwill, the Company has indefinite-lived intangible assets that consist of acquired tradenames. On an annual basis, during the Company's fourth quarter, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company compares the estimated fair value of the identified trade names to the carrying value to determine if potential impairment exists. If the fair value is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined using an income approach, the relief-from-royalty methodology, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future revenues, royalty rates, and the discount rate, among others. During the first quarter of the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company recognized $16.6 million impairment on indefinite life intangible assets of tradenames associated with the commercial DCF business due to the reduced value of the associated tradenames following the divestiture of the Coevorden Operations. With the recognition of the impairment, the respective intangible assets were adjusted to their determined fair value, leaving no excess fair value as of the measurement date. As of September 30, 2020, there are approximately $136.9 million of intangible assets that could be deemed at risk of future impairment due to the limited excess fair value.\nThe Company also reviews other definite-lived intangible assets and tangible fixed assets for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Circumstances such as the discontinuation of a product or product line, a sudden or consistent decline in the sales forecast for a product, changes in technology or in the way an asset is being used, a history of operating or cash flow losses or an adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, among others, may trigger an impairment review. If such indicators are present, the Company performs undiscounted cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. The asset value would be deemed impaired if the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset did not exceed the carrying value of the asset. If impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company recognized an impairment of $7.6 million on definite-lived intangible assets due to the incremental cash flow risk associated with the commercial DCF business following the divestiture of the Coevorden Operations, which consisted of the remaining carrying cost of the definite lived intangibles assets associated with the commercial DCF business.\nA considerable amount of judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests, principally in determining the fair value of each reporting unit and assets subject to impairment testing. While the Company believes its judgments and assumptions are reasonable, different assumptions could change the estimated fair value and therefore, additional impairment charges could be required. The Company is subject to financial statement risk in the event that business or economic conditions unexpectedly decline and impairment is realized.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax liabilities for all years subject to examination based upon management's evaluation of the facts and circumstances and information available for reporting. For those income tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained upon conclusion of an examination, the Company has recorded a reserve based upon the largest amount of tax benefit having a cumulatively greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority assuming that it has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, the Company did not recognize a tax benefit. As of September 30, 2020, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, that if not recognized would affect the effective tax rate in future periods was $17.7 million. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of income tax reserves and changes to those reserves when considered appropriate. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is finally resolved. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue may require the use of cash or a reduction in our net operating loss carryforwards or tax credits. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to the effective rate in the year of resolution.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, net operating losses, tax credit, and other carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company does not adjust its measurement for proposed future tax rate changes that have not yet been enacted into law. The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical losses, projected future taxable income, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. We base these estimates on projections of future income, including tax planning strategies, in certain jurisdictions. Changes in industry conditions and other economic conditions may impact our ability to project future income. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period we make that determination.\nAs of September 30, 2020, we have U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards ( NOLs\u201d) of $1,247.7 million, with a federal tax benefit of $262.0 million and future tax benefits related to state NOLs of $73.3 million. Our total valuation allowance for the tax benefit of deferred tax assets that may not be realized is $306.8 million at September 30, 2020. Of this amount, $283.6 million relates to U.S. net deferred tax assets and $23.2 million relates to foreign net deferred tax assets. We estimate that $155.8 million of valuation allowance related to domestic deferred tax assets cannot be released regardless of the amount of domestic operating income generated due to prior period ownership changes that limit the amount of NOLs and credits we can use.\nAs of September 30, 2020, we have provided no significant residual U.S. taxes on earnings not yet taxed in the U.S. As of September 30, 2020, we project $4.6 million of additional tax from non-U.S. withholding and other taxes expected to be incurred on repatriation of foreign earnings.\nSee Note 16 - Income Taxes of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere included in this Annual Report.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies and Practices of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere included in this Annual Report for information about recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted.", "summary": "The report is a management discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations for a company for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is management's discussion of the financial results, liquidity and other key items related to our performance and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following is a combined report of SBH and SB/RH, and the following discussion includes SBH and certain matters related to SB/RH as signified below. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the Company,\u201d we,\u201d our\u201d or us\u201d are used to refer to SBH and its subsidiaries and SB/RH and its subsidiaries, collectively\nBusiness Overview\nThe following section provides a general description of our business as well as recent developments for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, which we believe are important to understanding our results of operations, financial condition, and understanding anticipated future trends. Refer to Item 1 - Business and Note 1 - Description of Business in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report for an overview of our business. For a discussion of our fiscal 2018 results, please refer to Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019 filed with the SEC on November 15, 2019.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting regulations and other disruptions to both demand and supply may have a substantial impact on the commercial operations of the Company or impairment of the Company's net assets. Such impacts may include, but are not limited to, volatility of demand for our products, disruptions and cost implications in manufacturing and supply arrangements, inability of third parties to meet obligations under existing arrangements, and significant changes to the political and economic environments in which we manufacture, sell, and distribute our products.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2020 and as of the date of this report, we have been and continue to be classified as an essential business in the jurisdictions that have mandated closures of non-essential businesses, and therefore have been allowed to remain open. The Company did experience temporary shutdowns at certain operating facilities in response to government mandated restrictions or to address and implement preventative safety measures. During the second quarter ended March 29, 2020, there were certain HHI operating facilities, primarily within China and the Philippines, that experienced a temporary limit on production in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, but such facilities were operating at or near full capacity by the end of the second quarter. Subsequently, during the third quarter ended June 28, 2020, additional governmental operating restrictions were announced in Mexico temporarily suspending or limiting production for our HHI operating facilities, with facilities operating and ramping up productions by the end of the third quarter. Moreover, our H&G facility in St. Louis was temporarily closed in April 2020 to provide for additional cleaning and implementation of preventative measures in response to confirmed cases of COVID-19. These facilities continue to operate to the extent possible under existing regulations and may be subject to future closure depending upon unforeseeable duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and any governmental and public action.\nDespite the supply implications, the Company continued to experience strong customer demand. While demand in general for our products remains strong, our teams continue to monitor demand disruption and there can be no assurance as to the level of demand that will prevail following the year ended September 30, 2020. A large portion of our customers continue to operate and sell our products, with some customers reducing operations during the year ended September 30, 2020 due to closures or reduced store hours. The Company has experienced both positive and negative consumer behavior which may or may not continue. There have also been changes in consumer needs and spending during the COVID-19 pandemic, which have resulted in a limited number of change orders and reduced spending. Currently, we have not identified, and will continue to monitor for, any substantive risk attributable to customer credit and have not experienced a significant impact from permanent store closures or retail bankruptcies. We believe the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic to be uncertain and we expect it to continue to contribute to retail volatility and consumer purchase behavior changes. The magnitude of the financial impact on our results is highly dependent on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and how quickly the U.S. and global economies resume normal operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has not, as of the date of this report, had a materially negative impact on the Company's liquidity position. The sweeping nature of COVID-19 pandemic makes it extremely difficult to predict the long-term ramifications on our financial condition and results of operations. However, the likely overall economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is viewed as highly negative to the U.S. and global economies. During the year ended September 30, 2020, we have implemented mitigating efforts to manage non-critical capital spending, assess operating spend, preserve cash and liquidity. We continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs, and we expect to maintain access to the capital markets, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. We have also not observed any material impairments of our assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe expect the ultimate significance of the impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be dictated by the length of time that such circumstances continue, which will ultimately depend on the unforeseeable duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, any governmental and public actions taken in response and any related economic disruption.\nAcquisitions\nOn March 10, 2020, the Company aquired Omega Sea, LLC (\"Omega\"), a manufacturer and marketer of premium fish foods and consumable goods for the home and commercial aquarium markets, primarily consisting of the Omega brand, for a purchase price of approximately $16.9 million. The results of Omega's operations since March 10, 2020 are included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and reported within the GPC reporting segment for the year ended September 30, 2020. See Note 4 - Acquisitions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information.\nDivestitures\n\u2022Coevorden Operations - On March 29, 2020, the Company completed the sale of its DCF production facility and distribution center in Coevorden, Netherlands for cash proceeds of $29.0 million subject to working capital and other typical closing adjustments, resulting in a loss on assets held for sale of $26.8 million during the year ended September 30, 2020. The loss was recognized as a component of continuing operations and operating income within the Company's GPC segment.\n\u2022Global Batteries & Lighting ( GBL\u201d) - On January 2, 2019, the Company completed the sale of its GBL business pursuant to the GBL acquisition agreement with Energizer for cash proceeds of $1,956.2 million, resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax gain on sale of $989.8 million, including the estimated settlement of customary purchase price adjustments for working capital and assumed indebtedness, recognition of tax and legal indemnifications under the acquisition agreement and an estimated contingent purchase price adjustment for the settlement with the planned divestiture of the Varta\u00ae consumer batteries business by Energizer of $200.0 million in accordance with the GBL acquisition agreement. The results of operations and gain on sale for disposal of the GBL business are recognized as a component of discontinued operations.\n\u2022Global Auto Care ( GAC\u201d) - On January 28, 2019, the Company completed the sale of its GAC business pursuant to the GAC acquisition agreement with Energizer for $1.2 billion, consisting of $938.7 million in cash proceeds and $242.1 million in stock consideration of common stock of Energizer, resulting in the write-down of net assets held for sale of $111.0 million, including the estimated settlement of customary purchase price adjustments for working capital and assumed indebtedness, recognition of tax and legal indemnifications in accordance with the GAC acquisition agreement. Unrealized gains and losses realized for changes in the fair value of the Company's common stock investment in Energizer are recognized as Other Non-Operating Expense (Income), net on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income. The results of operations and write-down of net assets held for sale for the disposal of the GAC business are recognized as a component of discontinued operations.\n\u2022Home and Personal Care ( HPC\u201d) - During the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company initiated a plan to sell its GBA segment, consisting of its GBL business and HPC business, and classified the GBA operations as held for sale and discontinued operations. During the first quarter ended December 30, 2018, the Company changed its plans to sell its HPC business and classified the net assets of HPC as held for use and the HPC operations have been classified as continuing operations for all periods presented. During the period in which the HPC business was held for sale, the Company incurred divestiture related expenses to market and sell the business that were previously recognized as a component of discontinued operations and ceased the recognition of depreciation and amortization on long-lived assets of the HPC disposal group, impacting the comparability of financial results when classified as continuing operations, resulting in the recognition of $29.0 million in incremental depreciation and amortization charges during the year ended September 30, 2019.\nSee Note 3 - Divestitures in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further discussion pertaining to the divestitures.\nRestructuring Activity\nWe continually seek to improve our operational efficiency, match our manufacturing capacity and product costs to market demand and better utilize our manufacturing resources. We have undertaken various initiatives to reduce manufacturing and operating costs, which may have a significant impact on the comparability of financial results on the consolidated financial statements. The most significant of these initiatives is the Global Productivity Improvement Program, which began during the year ended September 30, 2019. See Note 5 - Restructuring and Related Charges in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further discussion pertaining to restructuring and related activity.\nRefinancing Activity\nThe following recent financing activity has a significant impact on the comparability of financial results on the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company (1) entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\"), which refinanced the Company's previously existing credit facility, extending the maturity, reducing the revolving facility under the Credit Agreement from $890 million to $600 million, and changing interest rate margins; (2) issued $300 million of its 5.50% Senior Unsecured Notes; and (3) completed the tender and call of its 6.625% Notes with an outstanding principal of $117.4 million initiated at the end of the year ended September 30, 2019.\n\u2022During the year ended September 30, 2019, the Company (1) repaid $452.6 million of its 6.625% Notes with an outstanding principal of $570.0 million, consisting of a repayment of $285.0 million on March 31, 2019 plus a repayment of $167.6 million on September 24, 2019 using proceeds from the GAC divestitures; (2) issued $300.0 million of 5.00% Senior Unsecured Notes due September 2029; (3) repaid its 7.75% Senior Unsecured Notes in full on January 30, 2019 using proceeds received from the GBL and GAC divestitures; (4) repaid its USD Term Loan in full on January 4, 2019 using proceeds received from the divestiture of GBL; and (5) repaid its CAD Term Loan in full on October 31, 2018.\nSee Note 12 - Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for additional detail regarding debt and refinancing activity.\nSalus CLO\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2020, the non-recourse debt under Salus CLO were effectively discharged resulting in the recognition of a non-cash gain on extinguishment of debt of $76.2 million. See Note 12 - Debt in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information.\nAdoption of New Lease Accounting Standard\nOn October 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and all the related amendments using the modified retrospective transition method, which resulted in the recognition of additional right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) lease assets of $107.5 million and additional lease liabilities of $113.0 million, with no material cumulative effect adjustment to equity as of the date of adoption. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. See Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies and Practices and Note 13 - Leases in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information.\nSubsequent Event\nOn October 26, 2020, the Company acquired Armitage Pet Care Ltd (\"Armitage\") for approximately $187 million. Located in Nottingham, United Kingdom, Armitage is a premium provider of pet treats and toys including a portfolio of brands that includes dog treats brand, Good Boy\u00ae, and cat treats brand, Meowee!\u00ae, among others, that are predominantly sold within the United Kingdom. The net assets and operating results of Armitage will be included in the financial statements subsequent to the balance sheet date of September 30, 2020 and included within the GPC reporting segment for all subsequent periods.\nNon-GAAP Measurements\nOur consolidated and segment results contain non-GAAP metrics such as organic net sales, and Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization). While we believe organic net sales and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace our financial results in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results.\nOrganic Net Sales. We define organic net sales as net sales excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and/or impact from acquisitions (where applicable). We believe this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rate and/or acquisitions. We use organic net sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and segment performance. Organic growth is calculated by comparing organic net sales to net sales in the prior year. The effect of changes in currency exchange rates is determined by translating the period's net sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior comparative period. Net sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination. We exclude net sales from acquired businesses in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. The following is a reconciliation of net sales to organic net sales of SBH and SB/RH for the year ended September 30, 2020 compared to net sales for the year ended September 30, 2019:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP metric used by management that we believe provides useful information to investors because it reflects the ongoing operating performance and trends of our segments, excluding certain non-cash based expenses and/or non-recurring items during each of the comparable periods. It also facilitates comparisons between peer companies since interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies. Adjusted EBITDA is also used for determining compliance with the Company's debt covenants. See Note 12 - Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for additional detail.\nEBITDA is calculated by excluding the Company's income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation expense and amortization expense (from intangible assets) from net income. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes:\n\u2022Stock based and other incentive compensation costs that consist of costs associated with long-term compensation arrangements and other equity based compensation based upon achievement of long-term performance metrics; and generally consist of non-cash, stock-based compensation. See Note 19 - Share Based Compensation in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further details. Additionally, the Company issued certain incentive bridge awards due to changes in the Company's long-term compensation plans that allow for cash based payment upon employee election which have been included in the adjustment but do not qualify for shared-based compensation.;\n\u2022Restructuring and related charges, which consist of project costs associated with the restructuring initiatives across the Company's segments. See Note 5 - Restructuring and Related Charges in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further details;\n\u2022Transaction related charges that consist of (1) transaction costs from qualifying acquisition transactions during the period, or subsequent integration related project costs directly associated with an acquired business; and (2) divestiture related transaction costs that are recognized in continuing operations and post-divestiture separation costs consisting of incremental costs to facilitate separation of shared operations, including development of transferred shared service operations, platforms and personnel transferred as part of the divestitures and exiting of transition service arrangements (TSAs) and reverse TSAs. See Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies and Practices in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further details;\n\u2022Gains and losses attributable to the Company's investment in Energizer common stock, acquired as part of consideration received from the Company's sale and divestiture of GAC during the year ended September 30, 2019. See Note 3 - Divestitures and Note 7 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further details;\n\u2022Non-cash asset impairments or write-offs realized and recognized in earnings from continuing operations (when applicable);\n\u2022Non-cash purchase accounting inventory adjustments recognized in earnings from continuing operations after an acquisition (when applicable);\n\u2022Foreign currency gains and losses attributable to multicurrency loans for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, that were entered into with foreign subsidiaries in exchange for the receipt of divestiture proceeds by the parent company and the distribution of the respective foreign subsidiaries' net assets as part of the GBL and GAC divestitures. The Company has entered into various hedging arrangements to mitigate the volatility of foreign exchange risk associated with such loans;\n\u2022Incremental reserves associated with environmental remediation activity of legacy properties and former manufacturing sites assumed by the organization which had previously been exited by the Company, plus legal settlement costs associated with retained litigation from the Company's divested GAC operations realized during the year ended September 30, 2019. See Note 20 - Commitments and Contingencies in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion;\n\u2022Legal and litigation costs associated with Salus during the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 as it is not considered a component of the continuing commercial products company, but continues to be consolidated by the Company after completion of the Spectrum Merger until the Salus operations can be wholly dissolved and/or deconsolidated;\n\u2022Gain on extinguishment of the Salus CLO debt due to the discharge of the obligation during the year ended September 30, 2020. See Note 12 - Debt in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further details; and\n\u2022Other adjustments primarily consisting of costs attributable to (1) expenses and cost recovery for flood damage at the Company's facilities in Middleton, Wisconsin recognized during the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019; (2) incremental costs for separation of a key executives during the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019; (3) incremental costs associated with a safety recall in GPC during the year ended September 30, 2019; (4) operating margin on H&G sales to GAC discontinued operations during the year ended September 30, 2019; and (5) certain fines and penalties for delayed shipments following the completion of a GPC distribution center consolidation in EMEA during the year ended September 30, 2019.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 for SBH:\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

See Note 4 - Acquisitions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information.\nDivestitures\n\u2022Coevorden Operations - On March 29, 2020, the Company completed the sale of its DCF production facility and distribution center in Coevorden, Netherlands for cash proceeds of $29.0 million subject to working capital and other typical closing adjustments, resulting in a loss on assets held for sale of $26.8 million during the year ended September 30, 2020. The loss was recognized as a component of continuing operations and operating income within the Company's GPC segment.\n\u2022Global Batteries & Lighting ( GBL\u201d) - On January 2, 2019, the Company completed the sale of its GBL business pursuant to the GBL acquisition agreement with Energizer for cash proceeds of $1,956.2 million, resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax gain on sale of $989.8 million, including the estimated settlement of customary purchase price adjustments for working capital and assumed indebtedness, recognition of tax and legal indemnifications under the acquisition agreement and an estimated contingent purchase price adjustment for the settlement with the planned divestiture of the Varta\u00ae consumer batteries business by Energizer of $200.0 million in accordance with the GBL acquisition agreement. The results of operations and gain on sale for disposal of the GBL business are recognized as a component of discontinued operations.\n\u2022Global Auto Care ( GAC\u201d) - On January 28, 2019, the Company completed the sale of its GAC business pursuant to the GAC acquisition agreement with Energizer for $1.2 billion, consisting of $938.7 million in cash proceeds and $242.1 million in stock consideration of common stock of Energizer, resulting in the write-down of net assets held for sale of $111.0 million, including the estimated settlement of customary purchase price adjustments for working capital and assumed indebtedness, recognition of tax and legal indemnifications in accordance with the GAC acquisition agreement. Unrealized gains and losses realized for changes in the fair value of the Company's common stock investment in Energizer are recognized as Other Non-Operating Expense (Income), net on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income. The results of operations and write-down of net assets held for sale for the disposal of the GAC business are recognized as a component of discontinued operations.\n\u2022Home and Personal Care ( HPC\u201d) - During the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company initiated a plan to sell its GBA segment, consisting of its GBL business and HPC business, and classified the GBA operations as held for sale and discontinued operations. During the first quarter ended December 30, 2018, the Company changed its plans to sell its HPC business and classified the net assets of HPC as held for use and the HPC operations have been classified as continuing operations for all periods presented. During the period in which the HPC business was held for sale, the Company incurred divestiture related expenses to market and sell the business that were previously recognized as a component of discontinued operations and ceased the recognition of depreciation and amortization on long-lived assets of the HPC disposal group, impacting the comparability of financial results when classified as continuing operations, resulting in the recognition of $29.0 million in incremental depreciation and amortization charges during the year ended September 30, 2019.\nSee Note 3 - Divestitures in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further discussion pertaining to the divestitures.\nRestructuring Activity\nWe continually seek to improve our operational efficiency, match our manufacturing capacity and product costs to market demand and better utilize our manufacturing resources. We have undertaken various initiatives to reduce manufacturing and operating costs, which may have a significant impact on the comparability of financial results on the consolidated financial statements. The most significant of these initiatives is the Global Productivity Improvement Program, which began during the year ended September 30, 2019. See Note 5 - Restructuring and Related Charges in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further discussion pertaining to restructuring and related activity.\nRefinancing Activity\nThe following recent financing activity has a significant impact on the comparability of financial results on the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company (1) entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\"), which refinanced the Company's previously existing credit facility, extending the maturity, reducing the revolving facility under the Credit Agreement from $890 million to $600 million, and changing interest rate margins; (2) issued $300 million of its 5.50% Senior Unsecured Notes; and (3) completed the tender and call of its 6.625% Notes with an outstanding principal of $117.4 million initiated at the end of the year ended September 30, 2019.\n\u2022During the year ended September 30, 2019, the Company (1) repaid $452.6 million of its 6.625% Notes with an outstanding principal of $570.0 million, consisting of a repayment of $285.0 million on March 31, 2019 plus a repayment of $167.6 million on September 24, 2019 using proceeds from the GAC divestitures; (2) issued $300.0 million of 5.00% Senior Unsecured Notes due September 2029; (3) repaid its 7.75% Senior Unsecured Notes in full on January 30, 2019 using proceeds received from the GBL and GAC divestitures; (4) repaid its USD Term Loan in full on January 4, 2019 using proceeds received from the divestiture of GBL; and (5) repaid its CAD Term Loan in full on October 31, 2018.\nSee Note 12 - Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for additional detail regarding debt and refinancing activity.\nSalus CLO\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2020, the non-recourse debt under Salus CLO were effectively discharged resulting in the recognition of a non-cash gain on extinguishment of debt of $76.2 million. See Note 12 - Debt in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information.\nAdoption of New Lease Accounting Standard\nOn October 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and all the related amendments using the modified retrospective transition method, which resulted in the recognition of additional right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) lease assets of $107.5 million and additional lease liabilities of $113.0 million, with no material cumulative effect adjustment to equity as of the date of adoption. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. See Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies and Practices and Note 13 - Leases in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information.\nSubsequent Event\nOn October 26, 2020, the Company acquired Armitage Pet Care Ltd (\"Armitage\") for approximately $187 million. Located in Nottingham, United Kingdom, Armitage is a premium provider of pet treats and toys including a portfolio of brands that includes dog treats brand, Good Boy\u00ae, and cat treats brand, Meowee!\u00ae, among others, that are predominantly sold within the United Kingdom. The net assets and operating results of Armitage will be included in the financial statements subsequent to the balance sheet date of September 30, 2020 and included within the GPC reporting segment for all subsequent periods.\nNon-GAAP Measurements\nOur consolidated and segment results contain non-GAAP metrics such as organic net sales, and Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization). While we believe organic net sales and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace our financial results in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results.\nOrganic Net Sales. We define organic net sales as net sales excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and/or impact from acquisitions (where applicable). We believe this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rate and/or acquisitions. We use organic net sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and segment performance. Organic growth is calculated by comparing organic net sales to net sales in the prior year. The effect of changes in currency exchange rates is determined by translating the period's net sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior comparative period. Net sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination. We exclude net sales from acquired businesses in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. The following is a reconciliation of net sales to organic net sales of SBH and SB/RH for the year ended September 30, 2020 compared to net sales for the year ended September 30, 2019:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>September 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Sales September 30, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except %) </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Effect of Changes in Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Net Sales Excluding Effect of Changes in Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Effect of Acquisitions\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Organic\nNet Sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HHI\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,342.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,342.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,342.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,355.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13.2) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.0 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HPC\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,107.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,126.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,126.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,068.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GPC\n</td> <td> </td> <td>962.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>963.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>956.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>870.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>9.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>H&G\n</td> <td> </td> <td>551.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>552.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>552.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>508.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,964.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,984.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,977.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,802.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>175.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP metric used by management that we believe provides useful information to investors because it reflects the ongoing operating performance and trends of our segments, excluding certain non-cash based expenses and/or non-recurring items during each of the comparable periods. It also facilitates comparisons between peer companies since interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies. Adjusted EBITDA is also used for determining compliance with the Company's debt covenants. See Note 12 - Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for additional detail.\nEBITDA is calculated by excluding the Company's income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation expense and amortization expense (from intangible assets) from net income. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes:\n\u2022Stock based and other incentive compensation costs that consist of costs associated with long-term compensation arrangements and other equity based compensation based upon achievement of long-term performance metrics; and generally consist of non-cash, stock-based compensation. See Note 19 - Share Based Compensation in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further details. Additionally, the Company issued certain incentive bridge awards due to changes in the Company's long-term compensation plans that allow for cash based payment upon employee election which have been included in the adjustment but do not qualify for shared-based compensation.;\n\u2022Restructuring and related charges, which consist of project costs associated with the restructuring initiatives across the Company's segments. See Note 5 - Restructuring and Related Charges in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further details;\n\u2022Transaction related charges that consist of (1) transaction costs from qualifying acquisition transactions during the period, or subsequent integration related project costs directly associated with an acquired business; and (2) divestiture related transaction costs that are recognized in continuing operations and post-divestiture separation costs consisting of incremental costs to facilitate separation of shared operations, including development of transferred shared service operations, platforms and personnel transferred as part of the divestitures and exiting of transition service arrangements (TSAs) and reverse TSAs. See Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies and Practices in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further details;\n\u2022Gains and losses attributable to the Company's investment in Energizer common stock, acquired as part of consideration received from the Company's sale and divestiture of GAC during the year ended September 30, 2019. See Note 3 - Divestitures and Note 7 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further details;\n\u2022Non-cash asset impairments or write-offs realized and recognized in earnings from continuing operations (when applicable);\n\u2022Non-cash purchase accounting inventory adjustments recognized in earnings from continuing operations after an acquisition (when applicable);\n\u2022Foreign currency gains and losses attributable to multicurrency loans for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, that were entered into with foreign subsidiaries in exchange for the receipt of divestiture proceeds by the parent company and the distribution of the respective foreign subsidiaries' net assets as part of the GBL and GAC divestitures. The Company has entered into various hedging arrangements to mitigate the volatility of foreign exchange risk associated with such loans;\n\u2022Incremental reserves associated with environmental remediation activity of legacy properties and former manufacturing sites assumed by the organization which had previously been exited by the Company, plus legal settlement costs associated with retained litigation from the Company's divested GAC operations realized during the year ended September 30, 2019. See Note 20 - Commitments and Contingencies in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion;\n\u2022Legal and litigation costs associated with Salus during the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 as it is not considered a component of the continuing commercial products company, but continues to be consolidated by the Company after completion of the Spectrum Merger until the Salus operations can be wholly dissolved and/or deconsolidated;\n\u2022Gain on extinguishment of the Salus CLO debt due to the discharge of the obligation during the year ended September 30, 2020. See Note 12 - Debt in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further details; and\n\u2022Other adjustments primarily consisting of costs attributable to (1) expenses and cost recovery for flood damage at the Company's facilities in Middleton, Wisconsin recognized during the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019; (2) incremental costs for separation of a key executives during the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019; (3) incremental costs associated with a safety recall in GPC during the year ended September 30, 2019; (4) operating margin on H&G sales to GAC discontinued operations during the year ended September 30, 2019; and (5) certain fines and penalties for delayed shipments following the completion of a GPC distribution center consolidation in EMEA during the year ended September 30, 2019.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 for SBH:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SPECTRUM BRANDS HOLDINGS, INC.
