Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1, \"Business - General Overview\" on page 2. Amounts in tables may not reconcile due to rounding differences. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Report, including information with respect to the Company's plans and strategy for its business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Please see the \"Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by any forward-looking statements contained in this discussion and analysis. You should review the \"Risk Factors\" set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained herein.\nOverview\nWe are a Bermuda-based holding company formed in June 2007 primarily focused on serving the needs of regional and specialty insurers in the U.S. and Europe by providing innovative reinsurance solutions designed to support their capital needs. We specialize in reinsurance solutions that optimize financing by providing coverage within the more predictable and actuarially credible lower layers of coverage and/or reinsuring risks that are believed to be lower hazard, more predictable and generally not susceptible to significant claims from natural catastrophes. Our tailored solutions include a variety of value added services focused on helping our clients grow and prosper.\nWe have operations in Bermuda and the U.S. which provide reinsurance through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Maiden Bermuda and Maiden US. Maiden Bermuda and Maiden US do not underwrite any primary insurance business. Maiden LF is a life insurer organized in Sweden and writes credit life insurance on a primary basis in support of Maiden Global business development efforts.\nOur business consists of two reportable segments: Diversified Reinsurance and AmTrust Reinsurance. Please refer to Item 1, \"Business - Our Reportable Segments\" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 for a discussion on our reportable segments.\nRecent Developments\nThe following are strategic and capital transactions that occurred during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nConversion of Mandatory Convertible Preference Shares - Series B\nMost recently, on September 15, 2016, the Company's $165.0 million mandatory convertible preference shares - Series B were automatically converted into 12,069,090 of the Company's common shares at a conversion rate of 3.6573 per preference share.\nIssuance of 2016 Senior Notes and Redemption of 2011 Senior Notes\nOn June 14, 2016, Maiden Holdings issued $110.0 million 6.625% Senior Notes and used the cash proceeds to fully redeem all of Maiden NA's 8.25% 2011 Senior Notes due 2041 on June 15, 2016, thus lowering our cost of capital.\nIssuance of Preference Shares - Series C\nOn November 25, 2015, the Company issued 6.6 million shares of 7.125% Preference Shares - Series C, par value $0.01, at a price of $25 per preference share. The Company received net proceeds of $159.5 million from the offering after deducting issuance costs of $5.5 million. Each share, which is redeemable at the Company's sole option beginning December 15, 2020, will be paid non-cumulative dividends at a rate of 7.125% per annum on the initial liquidation preference of $25 per share.\nThe Preference Shares - Series C have no voting rights other than to elect two additional members of the board of directors if dividends on the Preference Shares - Series C have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend periods. The Preference Shares - Series C have been listed on NYSE and trading commenced on November 27, 2015 under the symbol \"MHPRC\".\nSale of Maiden Specialty\nOn November 4, 2015, Maiden US finalized the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, Maiden Specialty, to Clear Blue. On the same date, Maiden US entered into a reinsurance agreement with Clear Blue whereby Maiden US reinsures all in-force policies transferred to Clear Blue as part of the sale. In addition, Maiden US entered into an agreement with Clear Blue whereby Maiden US assumes the responsibility for the administration and servicing of all aspects of the polices in-force at the date of sale.\n2016 Financial Highlights\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Summary Consolidated Statement of Income Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in Thousands except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Maiden common shareholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(84.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic earnings per common share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Maiden common shareholders(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(85.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating earnings attributable to Maiden common shareholders(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(84.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per common share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Maiden common shareholders(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(85.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating earnings attributable to Maiden common shareholders(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(84.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends per common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross premiums written\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,831,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,662,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,568,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,429,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting (loss) income(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53,180\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(219.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized operating return on average common shareholders' equity(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(84.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Financial Condition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in Thousands except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments and cash and cash equivalents(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,886,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,460,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,252,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,703,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve for loss and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,896,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,510,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior notes -

Management believes that these measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, better explain the Company's results in a manner that allows for a more complete understanding of the underlying trends in the Company's business. The non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These key financial measures are:\nOperating Earnings and Operating Earnings per Common Share: Management believes that the use of operating earnings and diluted operating earnings per share enables investors and other users of the Company's financial information to analyze its performance in a manner similar to how Management analyzes performance. Management also believes that these measures follow industry practice and, therefore, allow the users of financial information to compare the Company's performance with its industry peer group, and that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies which follow the Company, and the insurance industry as a whole, generally exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income.\nOperating earnings are an internal performance measure used by management as these measures focus on the underlying fundamentals of the Company's operations by excluding, on a recurring basis: (1) net realized gains or losses on investment; (2) impairment losses related to investments which were recognized in earnings; (3) foreign exchange and other gains or losses; (4) amortization of intangible assets; (5) loss and related activity from our run-off operations comprised of our former segment NGHC Quota Share and our divested E&S business; and (6) non-cash deferred tax expenses. We exclude net realized gains or losses on investment, impairment losses related to investments, and foreign exchange and other gains or losses as we believe these are influenced by market opportunities and other factors. We do not believe amortization of intangible assets and loss and related activity from our run-off operations are representative of our ongoing business. We believe all of these amounts are largely independent of our business and underwriting process and including them distorts the analysis of trends in our operations.\nIn addition to the recurring exclusions above, we also exclude certain non-recurring items that are material to understanding our results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we excluded the accelerated amortization of the 2011 Senior Notes issuance costs which was redeemed on June 15, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2014, we excluded: (1) the interest expense incurred on our 2013 Senior Notes prior to the redemption of the outstanding junior subordinated debt given the one time nature of the additional funding cost and (2) the accelerated amortization of the junior subordinated debt discount and the write-off of the associated issuance costs.\nOperating earnings and diluted operating earnings per common share can be reconciled to the nearest U.S. GAAP financial measure as follows:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

attributable to Maiden common shareholders decreased by $89.9 million, or 83.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015. This underwriting loss was caused by a $120.4 million increase in our provision for losses implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016, largely due to adverse development in our commercial auto line of business. The decline in underwriting results in 2016 was partially offset by increases in net investment income.\nOperating Return on Average Common Equity (\"Operating ROACE\"): Management uses operating return on average common shareholders' equity as a measure of profitability that focuses on the return to common shareholders. It is calculated using operating earnings available to common shareholders (as defined above) divided by average common shareholders' equity. Management has set, as a target, a long-term average of 15% Operating ROACE, which management believes provides an attractive return to shareholders for the risk assumed from our business.\nOperating ROACE for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was computed as follows:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At and For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings attributable to Maiden common shareholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Opening Maiden common shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>867,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>925,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>808,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending Maiden common shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,045,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>867,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>925,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Maiden common shareholders' equity(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>922,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>896,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>867,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating ROACE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Average common shareholders' equity for the year ended December 31, 2016 is adjusted for the period the Mandatory Convertible Preference Shares - Series B are outstanding (prior to mandatory conversion date of September 15, 2016).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBook Value per Common Share and Diluted Book Value per Common Share: Management uses growth in both of these metrics as a prime measure of the value we are generating for our common shareholders, as management believes that growth in each metric ultimately results in growth in the Company's common share price. These metrics are impacted by the Company's net income and external factors, such as interest rates, which can drive changes in unrealized gains or losses on our investment portfolio. At December 31, 2016, the book value per common share and the diluted book value per common share increased by 3.0% and 3.4% respectively, compared to December 31, 2015, (see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Investments\" on page 83 for further information).

Management measures underwriting results on an overall basis and for each segment on the basis of the combined ratio. The combined ratio is the sum of the net loss and LAE ratio and the expense ratio and the computations of each component are described below. A combined ratio under 100% indicates underwriting profitability, as the net loss and LAE, commission and other acquisition expenses and general and administrative expenses are less than the net premiums earned and other insurance revenue on that business. Prior to 2016, we have generated underwriting income in each year since inception. In 2016, we generated an underwriting loss due to our fourth quarter reserve charge of $120.4 million. Underwriting income is calculated by subtracting net loss and LAE, commissions and other acquisition expenses and applicable general and administrative expenses from the net premiums earned and other insurance revenue and is the monetized counterpart of the combined ratio. For purposes of these operating measures, the fee-generating business which is included in our Diversified Reinsurance segment, is considered part of the underwriting operations of the Company.\nWhile an important metric of success, underwriting income and combined ratio do not reflect all components of profitability, as they do not recognize the impact of investment income earned on premiums between the time premiums are received and the time loss payments are ultimately paid to clients. Because we do not manage our cash and investments by segment, investment income and interest expense are not allocated to individual reportable segments. Certain general and administrative expenses are allocated to segments based on various factors, including staff count and each segment's proportional share of gross premiums written.\nThe \"net loss and LAE ratio\" is derived by dividing net loss and LAE by the sum of net premiums earned and other insurance revenue. The \"commission and other acquisition expense ratio\" is derived by dividing commission and other acquisition expenses by the sum of net premiums earned and other insurance revenue. The \"general and administrative expense ratio\" is derived by dividing general and administrative expenses by the sum of net premiums earned and other insurance revenue. The \"expense ratio\" is the sum of the commission and other acquisition expense ratio and the general and administrative expense ratio.\nRelevant Factors\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues primarily from premiums on our insurance policies and reinsurance contracts, net of any reinsurance or retrocessional coverage purchased. Insurance and reinsurance premiums are a function of the amounts and types of policies and contracts we write, as well as prevailing market prices. Our prices are determined before our ultimate costs, which may extend far into the future, are known.\nThe Company's revenues also include fee income as well as income generated from our investment portfolio. The Company's investment portfolio is comprised of fixed maturity investments, currently held as AFS and HTM, and other investments. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these investments, except for HTM fixed maturities, are carried at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings. These unrealized gains and losses are included on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") as a separate component of shareholders' equity. If unrealized losses are considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired due to a credit event, such losses are included in earnings as a realized loss.\nExpenses\nOur expenses consist largely of net loss and LAE, commission and other acquisition expenses, general and administrative expenses, interest and amortization expenses, amortization of intangible assets and foreign exchange and other gains or losses.\nNet loss and LAE has three main components:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>losses paid, which are actual cash payments to insureds, net of recoveries from reinsurers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>change in outstanding loss or case reserves, which represent cedants' best estimate of the likely settlement amount for known claims, less the portion that can be recovered from reinsurers; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>change in IBNR reserves, which are reserves established by us for changes in the values of claims that have been reported to us but are not yet settled, as well as claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us. The portion recoverable from our reinsurers is deducted from the gross estimated loss.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommission and other acquisition expenses include commissions, brokerage fees and insurance taxes. Commissions and brokerage fees are usually calculated as a percentage of premiums and depend on the market and line of business and can, in certain instances, vary based on loss sensitive features of reinsurance contracts. Commission and other acquisition expenses are reported after: (1) deducting commissions received on ceded reinsurance; (2) deducting the part of commission and other acquisition expenses relating to unearned premiums; and (3) including the amortization of previously deferred commission and other acquisition expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include personnel expenses (including share-based compensation expense), rent expense, professional fees, information technology costs and other general operating expenses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIt is important to understand our accounting policies in order to understand our financial position and results of operations. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The following presents a discussion of those accounting policies and estimates that management believes are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgment. If actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions and estimates used by management, there could be material adjustments to prior estimates that could potentially adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in conjunction with \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies\" included under Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K for a full understanding of the Company's accounting policies.\nReserve for Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nGeneral: The amount of time that elapses before a claim is reported to the cedant and then subsequently reported to the reinsurer is commonly referred to in the industry as the reporting tail. Lines of business for which claims are reported quickly are commonly referred to as short-tailed lines; and lines of business for which a longer period of time elapses before claims are reported to the reinsurer are commonly referred to as long-tailed lines. In general, for reinsurance, the time lags are longer than for primary business due to the delay that occurs between the cedant becoming aware of a loss and reporting the information to its reinsurer(s). The delay varies by reinsurance market (country of cedant), type of treaty, whether losses are paid by the cedant and the size of the loss. The delay could vary from a few weeks to a year or sometimes longer.\nBecause a significant amount of time can elapse, particularly on longer-tail lines of business, between the assumption of risk, the occurrence of a loss event, the reporting of the event to an insurance company (the primary company or the cedant), the subsequent reporting to the reinsurance company (\"the reinsurer\") and the ultimate payment of the claim on the loss event by the reinsurer, the Company's liability for unpaid loss and LAE (\"loss reserves\") is based largely upon estimates. The Company categorizes loss reserves into two types of reserves: reported outstanding loss reserves (\"case reserves\") and IBNR reserves. Case reserves represent, for each individual claim, an estimate of unpaid losses, either by the Company's cedants or the Company's claims handling professionals, and recorded by the Company. IBNR reserves represent a provision for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the Company, as well as future loss development on losses already reported, in excess of the case reserves. The Company updates its estimates for each of the aforementioned categories on a quarterly basis using information received from its cedants.\nFor excess of loss treaties, cedents generally are required to report losses that either (i) exceed 50% of their retention; or (ii) have a reasonable probability of exceeding the retention; or (iii) meet defined reporting criteria. All reinsurance claims that are reserved are reviewed at least every six months. In addition, reserves for loss and LAE are reviewed every quarter for each cedant. For proportional treaties, cedents are required to give a periodic statement of account, generally monthly or quarterly. These periodic statements typically include information regarding written premiums, earned premiums, unearned premiums, ceding commissions, brokerage amounts, applicable taxes, paid losses and outstanding losses. They can be submitted up to 90 days after the close of the reporting period. Some proportional treaties have specific language requiring earlier notice of serious claims.\nFor all lines, the Company's objective is to estimate ultimate loss and LAE. Total loss reserves are then calculated by subtracting losses paid. Similarly, IBNR reserves are calculated by subtraction of case reserves from total loss reserves. IBNR is the estimated liability for (1) changes in the values of claims that have been reported to us but are not yet settled, as well as (2) claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported as well as (3) claims that are closed but subsequently reopen. Each claim is settled individually based upon its merits, and particularly for longer-tailed lines of business, it is not unusual for a claim to take years after being reported to settle, especially if legal action is involved. As a result, the reserve for loss and LAE include significant estimates for IBNR reserves.\nThe reserve for IBNR is estimated by management for each account based on various factors, including our underwriting team's expectations about loss experience, actuarial analysis and loss experience to date. Our actuaries employ standard actuarial methodologies to determine estimated ultimate loss reserves.\nIn selecting management's best estimate of loss and LAE reserves, we consider the range of results produced by many actuarial methods and the appropriateness of those estimates. The methodologies that the Company employs include, but may not be limited to, the Expected Loss Ratio method, the Reported Loss and Paid Loss Development methods and the Incurred and (as applicable) Paid Bornhuetter-Ferguson (\"BF\") methods.\nThe reserve methodologies employed by the Company are dependent on data that the Company collects. This data consists primarily of case reserves and loss payments reported by the Company's cedants, and premiums written and earned reported by cedants or estimated by the Company. The actuarial methods used by the Company to project loss reserves in our Diversified Reinsurance segment that it will pay in the future (future liabilities) do not generally include methodologies that are dependent on claim counts reported, claim counts settled or claim counts open as, due to the nature of the Company's business, this information is not routinely provided by cedants for every treaty. Consequently, actuarial methods relying on this information cannot be used by the Company to estimate loss reserves in our Diversified Reinsurance segment. However, the Company does use actuarial methods in the AmTrust Reinsurance segments that are dependent on claim counts reported, claim counts settled or claim counts open.\nThe reserve for loss and LAE at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve for reported loss and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,617,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,411,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve for losses incurred but not reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,278,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,098,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve for loss and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,896,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,510,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile management believes that our case reserves and IBNR are sufficient to cover losses assumed by us, there can be no assurance that losses will not deviate from our reserves, possibly by material amounts. The methodology and assumptions used to estimate loss reserves are reviewed at least quarterly, with adjustments made as appropriate. To the extent actual reported losses exceed estimated losses, the carried estimate of the ultimate losses will be increased (i.e. unfavorable reserve development), and to the extent actual reported losses are less than our expectations, the carried estimate of ultimate losses will be reduced (i.e. favorable reserve development). We record any changes in our loss reserve estimates and the related reinsurance recoverable in the periods in which they are determined.\nLoss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, loss reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate resolution and administration of claims will cost. These estimates are based on actuarial projections and on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. Loss reserve estimates are refined as experience develops and as claims are reported and resolved. In addition, the relatively long periods between when a loss occurs and when it may be reported to our claims department for our casualty reinsurance lines of business also increase the uncertainties of our reserve estimates in such lines.\nActuarial Methods Used to Estimate Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves: We utilize a variety of standard actuarial methods in our analysis. The selections from these various methods are based on the loss development characteristics of the specific line of business. The actuarial methods we utilize include:\nThe Expected Loss Ratio (\"ELR\") method is a technique that multiplicatively applies an expected loss ratio to earned premium to yield estimated ultimate losses. The ELR assumption is derived most often from the pricing of the business that is being reserved but can be based on historical experience of the business. This method is frequently used for the purpose of stability in the early valuations of an underwriting year with large and uncertain loss development factors. This technique does not take into account actual loss experience for the underwriting year being projected. As an underwriting year matures and actual loss experience becomes available, other methods may be applied in determining the estimated ultimate losses.\nThe Loss Development (\"LD\") method is a common reserving method in which ultimate losses are estimated by applying a loss development factor to actual reported (or paid) loss experience. This method fully utilizes actual experience. Multiplication of underwriting year actual reported (or paid) losses by its respective development factor produces the estimated ultimate losses. The LD method is based upon the assumption that the relative change in a given underwriting year's losses from one evaluation point to the next is similar to the relative change in prior underwriting years' losses at similar evaluation points. In addition, this method is based on the assumption that the reserving and payment patterns as well as the claim handling procedures have not changed substantially over time. When a company has a sufficiently reliable loss development history, a development pattern based on the company's historical indications may be used to develop losses to ultimate values.\nThe BF reserving technique is commonly used for long-tailed or volatile lines. It is also useful in situations where the reported loss experience is relatively immature and/or lacks sufficient credibility for the application of methods that are more heavily reliant on emerged experience. The BF method is an additive IBNR method that combines the ELR and LD techniques by splitting the expected loss into two pieces - expected reported (or paid) losses and expected unreported (or unpaid) losses. Expected unreported (unpaid) losses are added to the current actual reported (or paid) losses to produce an estimate of ultimate losses by underwriting year. The BF method introduces an element of stability that moderates the impact of inconsistent changes in paid and reported amounts.\nThe average frequency and severity ( FS\u201d) technique is used for lines where claim count is available, and the estimate of loss development factors is more difficult due to volatility in historical data. The available data for such lines is usually more volatile in the estimation of future losses using the LD and BF reserving methods. The frequency and severity method uses historical data to estimate the average number of reported claims (frequency) and the average costs of closed claims (severity). The estimate of ultimate losses by underwriting year is the result of the multiplication of the average number of claims and the average cost of a claim.\nWith the guidance of the methods above, actuarial judgment is applied in the determination of ultimate losses. In general, the Company's segments have varying levels of seasoning with which the Company has direct experience and as a result, differing methods are utilized to estimate loss and LAE reserves in each segment.\nIn our Diversified Reinsurance segment, the Company's executive and technical management, including claims and underwriting, have significant experience with this book of business, which also has more than 30 years of loss experience associated with it. In general for our Diversified Reinsurance segment, we utilize the ELR approach at the onset of reserving an account, the BF method for business with less but maturing loss experience, and as the experience matures the LD Method.\nThe Company has underwritten the AmTrust Reinsurance segment since July 1, 2007. The majority of the exposure in the underlying book of business has significant seasoning, and allows for a significant amount of credibility in using parameters derived from historical experience to calculate reserve estimates. Some segments of the book are a result of recent acquisitions or newer markets for AmTrust. These segments require a greater level of assumptions and professional judgment in deriving reserve levels, which inherently implies a wider range of reasonable estimates. As a result, we have tended to rely on a weighted approach which primarily employs the LD method for aspects of the segment with ample historical data, while also considering the ELR or BF method for exposure resulting from recent acquisitions, or a relative business with a more limited level of experience. The FS method is also considered for segments of the AmTrust book for which claim count information is available. The Company's actuarial analysis of this book of business is more refined in that it utilizes a combination of quarterly and annual data instead of contract period data in totality. Additional data detailing items such as class of business, state, claim counts, frequency and severity is available, further enhancing the reserve analysis. Because of the refinement of the data, this allows for greater use of the loss development method earlier on in the maturity of the book than would ordinarily occur.\nSignificant Assumptions Employed in the Estimation of Reserve for Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses: The most significant assumptions used at December 31, 2016 to estimate the reserve for loss and LAE within the Company's segments are as follows:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the information developed from internal and independent external sources can be used to develop meaningful estimates of the likely future performance of business bound by the Company;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the loss and exposure information provided by ceding companies, insureds and brokers in support of their submissions have been used by Maiden's pricing actuaries to derive meaningful estimates of the likely future performance of business bound with respect to each contract and policy;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>historic loss development and trend experience is assumed to be indicative of future loss development and trends; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>no significant emergence of losses or types of losses that are not represented in the information supplied to the Company by its brokers, ceding companies and insureds will occur.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above four assumptions most significantly influence the Company's determination of initial expected loss ratios and expected loss reporting patterns that are the key inputs which impact potential variability in the estimate of the reserve for loss and LAE and are applicable to each of the Company's business segments. These factors are combined with the actuarial judgment exercised by our reserving staff, and validated by the external review of our reserving levels. While there can be no assurance that any of the above assumptions will prove to be correct, we believe that this process represents a realistic and appropriate basis for estimating the reserve for loss and LAE. Our reporting factors and expected loss ratios are based on a blend of our own experience, cedant experience and industry benchmarks. The benchmarks selected were those that we believe are most similar to our underwriting business.\nFactors Creating Uncertainty in the Estimation of the Reserve for Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses: While management does not at this time include an explicit or implicit provision for uncertainty in its reserve for loss and LAE, certain of the Company's business lines are by their nature subject to additional uncertainties, which are discussed in detail below. In addition, the Company's reserves are subject to additional factors which add to the uncertainty of estimating reserve for loss and LAE. Time lags in the reporting of losses can also introduce further ambiguity to the process of estimating reserve for loss and LAE.\nThe inherent uncertainty of estimating the Company's reserve for loss and LAE increases principally due to:\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the lag in time between the time claims are reported to the ceding company and the time they are reported through one or more reinsurance broker intermediaries to the Company;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the differing reserving practices among ceding companies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the diversity of loss development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or contracts; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the Company's need to rely on its ceding companies for loss information, which also exposes the Company to changes in the reserving philosophy of the ceding company and the adequacy of its underlying case reserves.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn order to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information provided to the Company by its ceding company counterparties, the Company's underwriters, actuaries, accounting and claims personnel perform underwriting and claims reviews, and also accounting and financial audits, of the Company's ceding companies. Any material findings are communicated to the ceding companies and utilized in the establishment or revision of the Company's case reserves and related IBNR reserve. On occasion, these reviews reveal that the ceding company's reported loss and LAE do not comport with the terms of the contract with the Company. In such events, the Company strives to resolve the outstanding differences in an amicable fashion. The large majority of such differences are resolved in this manner. In the infrequent instance where an amicable solution is not feasible, the Company's policy is to vigorously defend its position in litigation or arbitration. At December 31, 2016, the Company was not involved in any material claims litigation or arbitration proceedings.\nDue to the large volume of potential transactions that must be recorded in the insurance and reinsurance industry, backlogs in the recording of the Company's business activities can also impair the accuracy of its loss and LAE reserve estimates. At December 31, 2016, there were no significant backlogs related to the processing of policy or contract information in the Company's segments.\nThe Company assumes in its loss and LAE reserving process that, on average, the time periods between the recording of expected losses and the reporting of actual losses are predictable when measured in the aggregate and over time. The time period over which all losses are expected to be reported to the Company varies significantly by line of business. This period can range from a few quarters for some lines, such as property, to many years for some casualty lines of business. To the extent that actual reported losses are reported more quickly or more slowly than expected, the Company may adjust its estimate of ultimate loss.\nPotential Volatility in the Reserve for Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses: In addition to the factors creating uncertainty in the Company's estimate of loss and LAE, the Company's estimated reserve for loss and LAE can change over time because of unexpected changes in the external environment. Potential changing external factors include:\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in the inflation rate for goods and services related to the covered damages;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in the general economic environment that could cause unanticipated changes in claim frequency or severity;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in the litigation environment regarding the representation of plaintiffs and potential plaintiffs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in the judicial and/or arbitration environment regarding the interpretation of policy and contract provisions relating to the determination of coverage and/or the amount of damages awarded for certain types of claims;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in the social environment regarding the general attitude of juries in the determination of liability and damages;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in the legislative environment regarding the definition of damages;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>new types of injuries caused by new types of injurious activities or exposures; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in ceding company case reserving and reporting patterns.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's estimates of reserve for loss and LAE can also change over time because of changes in internal company operations, such as:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>alterations in claims handling procedures;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>growth in new lines of business where exposure and loss development patterns are not well established; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in the quality of risk selection or pricing in the underwriting process.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDue to the inherent complexity of the assumptions used in establishing the Company's loss and LAE reserve estimates, final claim settlements made by the Company may vary significantly from the present estimates, particularly when those settlements may not occur until well into the future. The expected pattern of loss emergence and the projected level of profitability, two primary factors in establishing the loss and LAE reserves, are subject to a normal level of variance. The recognition of this variance defines a possible range of reserve estimates, from which the best estimate of the provision for reserves is derived. In addition, the Company's segments have varying levels of seasoning with which the Company has direct experience and as a result, the reasonably likely variance of our expected loss ratio for each segment varies commensurately with that experience.\nBased on a range of reasonable reserve estimates, we believe that if our final loss ratio were to vary from the expected loss ratios in the aggregate, our required reserves after reinsurance recoverable could increase by approximately $180.9 million, or 6.5% of our net loss and LAE reserves, as at December 31, 2016.\nThe Company has underwritten the AmTrust Reinsurance segment since July 1, 2007. In addition, certain aspects of this segment are associated with recent acquisitions by AmTrust and while the underlying experience of the book has significant seasoning, the combination of the shorter time frame with which the Company has direct experience with this business and the relative immaturity of certain aspects of this business may result in a greater range of volatility in the reasonably likely variance of our expected loss ratio for all applicable loss years in the segment compared to our Diversified Reinsurance segment.\nPremiums and Commissions and Other Acquisition Expenses\nFor pro-rata contracts and excess-of-loss contracts where no deposit or minimum premium is specified in the contract, written premium is recognized based on estimates of ultimate premiums provided by the ceding companies. Initial estimates of written premium are recognized in the period in which the underlying risks are incepted. Subsequent adjustments, based on reports of actual premium by the ceding companies, or revisions in estimates, are recorded in the period in which they are determined. Reinsurance premiums assumed are generally earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the underlying policies or reinsurance contracts.\nContracts and policies written on a \"losses occurring\" basis cover claims that may occur during the term of the contract or policy, which is typically 12 months. Accordingly, the premium is earned evenly over the term. Contracts which are written on a \"risks attaching\" basis cover claims which attach to the underlying insurance policies written during the terms of such contracts. Premiums earned on such contracts extend beyond the original term of the reinsurance contract, typically resulting in recognition of premiums earned over a 24-month period.\nReinsurance premiums on specialty risk and extended warranty are earned based on the estimated program coverage period. These estimates are based on the expected distribution of coverage periods by contract at inception, because a single contract may contain multiple coverage period options and these estimates are revised based on the actual coverage period selected by the original insured.\nUnearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written which is applicable to the unexpired term of the contract or policy in force. These premiums can be subject to estimates based upon information received from ceding companies and any subsequent differences arising on such estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined.\nThe Company provides proportional and non-proportional reinsurance coverage to cedants (insurance companies). In most cases, cedants seek protection for business that they have not yet written at the time they enter into reinsurance agreements and thus have to estimate the volume of premiums they will cede to the Company. Reporting delays are inherent in the reinsurance industry and vary in length by type of treaty. As delays can vary from a few weeks to a year or sometimes longer, the Company produces accounting estimates to report premiums and commission and other acquisition expenses until it receives the cedants' actual results. Under proportional treaties, which represented 92.3% (2015 - 91.0%, 2014 - 88.2%) of gross premiums written for the year December 31, 2016, the Company shares proportionally in both the premiums and losses of the cedant and pays the cedant a commission to cover the cedant's acquisition expenses. Under this type of treaty, the Company's ultimate premiums written and earned and acquisition expenses are not known at the inception of the treaty and must be estimated until the cedant reports its actual results to the Company. Under non-proportional treaties, which represented 7.7% (2015 - 9.0%, 2014 - 11.8%) of gross premiums written for the year December 31, 2016, the Company is typically exposed to loss events in excess of a predetermined dollar amount or loss ratio and receives a deposit or minimum premium, which is subject to adjustment depending on the premium volume written by the cedant.\nReported premiums written and earned and commission and other acquisition expenses on proportional treaties are generally based upon reports received from cedants and brokers, supplemented by the Company's own estimates of premiums written and commission and other acquisition expenses for which ceding company reports have not been received. Premium and acquisition expense estimates are determined at the individual treaty level based upon contract provisions. The determination of estimates requires a review of the Company's experience with cedants, a thorough understanding of the individual characteristics of each line of business and the ability to project the impact of current economic indicators on the volume of business written and ceded by the Company's cedants. Estimates for premiums and commission and other acquisition expenses are updated continuously as new information is received from the cedants. Differences between such estimates and actual amounts are recorded in the period in which estimates are changed or the actual amounts are determined.\nAssessing whether or not a reinsurance contract meets the condition for risk transfer requires judgment. The determination of risk transfer is critical to reporting premiums written and is based, in part, on the use of actuarial and pricing models and assumptions. If we determine that a reinsurance contract does not transfer sufficient risk, we account for the contract as deposit liability.\nAcquisition expenses represent the costs of writing business that vary with, and are primarily related to, the production of the business. Acquisition expenses that are related to successful contracts are deferred and recognized as expense over the same period in which the related premiums are earned.\nOnly certain expenses incurred in the successful acquisition of new and renewal insurance contracts are capitalized. Those expenses include incremental direct costs of contract acquisition that result directly from and are essential to the contract transaction and would not have been incurred had the contract transaction not occurred. All other acquisition-related expenses, such as costs incurred for soliciting business, administration, and unsuccessful acquisition or renewal efforts are charged to expense as incurred. Administrative expenses, including rent, depreciation, occupancy, equipment, and all other general overhead expenses are considered indirect and are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company considers anticipated investment income in determining the recoverability of these deferred costs and believes they are fully recoverable. A premium deficiency is recognized if the sum of anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses, unamortized acquisition expenses and anticipated investment income exceed unearned premium.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nPlease refer to \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\" included under Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K on page for a discussion on the fair value methodology and valuation techniques used by the Company to determine the fair value of the financial instruments held at December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment (\"OTTI\") of Investments\nPlease refer to \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2. \"Significant Accounting Policies\" included under Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K on page for a discussion on the OTTI evaluation performed by the Company to determine if an impairment is OTTI.\nThe Company recognized no OTTI through earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016 (2015 - $1.1 million, 2014 - $2.4 million). Please refer to \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4. Investments\" included under Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K on page for further details.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company recognizes Goodwill and Intangible Assets in connection with certain acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is assigned to the applicable reporting unit(s) on the acquisition date, based upon the expected benefit to be received by the reporting unit. Intangible Assets consist of finite and indefinite life assets. Finite life intangible assets include customer and producer relationships and trademarks with useful life of 15 years. Insurance company licenses are considered indefinite life intangible assets.\nOn November 4, 2015, Maiden US finalized the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, Maiden Specialty, to Clear Blue. On the same date, the goodwill and intangible assets disposed of, by way of this sale agreement, were $1.1 million and $3.2 million, respectively.\nAnnually, the Company makes an assessment as to whether the value of the Company's goodwill and intangible assets are impaired. Impairment, which can be either partial or full, is based on a fair value analysis by individual reporting unit. During 2016, the Company has written off the goodwill relating to the acquisition of a majority interest in Regulatory Capital, Ltd., trading as Insurance Regulatory Capital or IRC, which was deemed to be permanently impaired. The Company recognized an impairment loss of $1.8 million as a result. No impairment was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The Company's net goodwill and intangible assets, after the impairment charge, as at December 31, 2016 were $77.7 million (2015 - $81.9 million).\nIn making an assessment of the value of its goodwill and intangible assets, the Company uses both market based and non-market based valuations. Assumptions underlying these valuations include an analysis of the Company's share price relative to both its book value and its net income in addition to forecasts of future cash flows and future profits. Significant changes in the data underlying these assumptions could result in an assessment of impairment of the Company's goodwill asset. In addition, if the current economic environment and/or the Company's financial performance were to deteriorate significantly, this could lead to an impairment of goodwill and intangible, the write-off of which would be recorded against net income in the period such deterioration occurred. If a 5% decline in the fair value of the reporting units occurred, this would not result in an impairment of the goodwill asset at December 31, 2016.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets

As a result of these factors, combined with adverse development in both our Diversified Reinsurance segment and on the run-off of the NGHC Quota Share, in our Other category, the combined ratio (excluding the general and administrative expense ratio) increased by 1.4 points for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014.\nCommission and Other Acquisition Expenses\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nCommission and other acquisition expenses increased by $49.5 million, or 6.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. The commission and other acquisition expense ratio increased to 30.0% for the year December 31, 2016 compared to 29.7% for the same period in 2015. Please refer to the reasons for the changes in the combined ratio discussed in the Net Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses section above.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nCommission and other acquisition expenses increased by $64.9 million, or 9.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. The commission and other acquisition expense ratio increased to 29.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 29.1% for the same period in 2014. Please refer to the reasons for the changes in the combined ratio discussed in the Net Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses section above.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include expenses which are segregated for analytical purposes as a component of underwriting income.

The increase in total general and administrative expenses is primarily due to an increase in employee compensation and professional fees offset by a decrease in legal fees. The general and administrative expense ratio decreased to 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nTotal general and administrative expenses increased by $2.3 million, or 3.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in total general and administrative expenses is primarily due to an increase in employee compensation and professional fees offset by a decrease in legal fees. The general and administrative expense ratio slightly decreased to 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 2.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest and Amortization Expense and Accelerated Amortization of Debt Discount and Issuance Cost\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nThe interest and amortization expenses related to our Senior Notes were $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $29.1 million for the same period in 2015. The weighted average effective interest rate for the Company's debt was 8.02% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 8.25% in 2015. Refer to \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 7. Long Term Debt\" for details on the Company's Senior Notes.\nOn June 15, 2016, Maiden NA fully redeemed all of its 2011 Senior Notes using the proceeds from the 2016 Senior Notes issuance. The 2011 Senior Notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of $107.5 million plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed up to, but not including, the redemption date. As a result, the Company accelerated the amortization of the remaining debt issuance cost of $2.3 million.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe decrease in interest and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was due to the Company incurring an interest expense on the junior subordinated debt prior to its redemption on January 15, 2014. The weighted average effective interest rate for the Company's debt was 8.25% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 8.38% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Also, as a result of the redemption, during the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company incurred a non-recurring, non-cash charge of $28.2 million, which represents the accelerated amortization of original issuance discount and write-off of issuance costs associated with the Junior Subordinate Debt.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $1.6 million, $2.0 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These amounts relate to income tax on the earnings of our international subsidiaries, non-cash U.S. deferred tax expense relating to timing differences and state taxes incurred by our U.S. subsidiaries. The effective rate of income tax was 3.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 1.6% and 2.1% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDividends on Preference Shares\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, dividends paid to preference shareholders increased by $9.4 million or 38.7% compared to the same period in 2015. The increase is attributable to the issuance of 6,600,000 7.125% Preference Shares - Series C on November 25, 2015. The dividends paid to preference shareholders were $24.3 million in each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nUnderwriting Results by Reportable Segment\nDiversified Reinsurance Segment\nThe underwriting results and associated ratios for our Diversified Reinsurance segment for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross premiums written\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>824,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>776,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>897,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums written\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>766,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>734,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>850,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>724,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>744,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>854,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other insurance revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(579,520\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(547,296\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(579,771\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commission and other acquisition expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(188,506\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(196,292\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(233,711\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35,681\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35,312\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38,858\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(68,766\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,513\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratios\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss and LAE ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commission and other acquisition expense ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expense ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nThe combined ratio increased to 109.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 103.0% in 2015. Reserve development in commercial auto continued to unfavorably impact our Diversified Reinsurance segment resulting in underwriting losses.\nPremiums - Gross premiums written increased by $47.5 million, or 6.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to growth resulting from existing client accounts and premium from new customers won throughout the year as well as the new European treaty contracts written by Maiden Bermuda in 2016.\nNet premiums written increased by $31.3 million or 4.3%, for the year December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 due to the same circumstances as described above related to this segment's gross premiums written.

The decrease, however, was slightly reduced by earned premiums from the European treaty contracts written by Maiden Bermuda in 2016.\nOther Insurance Revenue - Other insurance revenue, which represents fee income that is not directly associated with premium revenue assumed by the Company decreased by $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease was mainly caused by weaker auto sales in Europe.\nNet Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses - Net loss and LAE increased by $32.2 million, or 5.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. Net loss and LAE ratios were 78.9% and 72.3% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, reflecting further adverse development primarily from commercial auto liability in Maiden US of $85.7 million.\nThe impact on the net loss and LAE ratios should be considered in conjunction with the commission and other acquisition expense ratio as changes to either ratio arise primarily due to changes in the mix of business and the impact of the increase in the commission and other acquisition expense rates on pro-rata contracts with loss sensitive features. As a result of these factors, the combined ratio (excluding the general and administrative expense ratio) increased by 6.2 points for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015.\nCommission and Other Acquisition Expenses - Commission and other acquisition expenses decreased by $7.8 million, or 4.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. The commission and other acquisition expense ratios decreased to 25.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 26.0% for the same period in 2015. Please refer to the reasons for the changes in the combined ratio discussed in the preceding paragraph.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses - General and administrative expenses increased by $0.4 million, or 1.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. The general and administrative expense ratio was 4.9% and 4.7% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in Maiden US premium following underwriting actions taken by the Company as well as the loss of a large customer and the expiration of a fronting arrangement in September 2014. In addition, there was a reduction in the International business written due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\nNet premiums written decreased by $115.3 million or 13.6%, for the year December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014.

This net decrease includes a $2.5 million adverse impact on our non-U.S. dollar denominated fee income due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the foreign currency exchange rates for the same period in 2014, respectively.\nNet Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses - Net loss and LAE decreased by $32.5 million, or 5.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. This decrease reflects the loss of business as discussed in the Net Premiums Written section above combined with the favorable impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar on Net loss and LAE. Net loss and LAE ratios were 72.3% and 66.8% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, reflecting the adverse development from commercial auto liability in Maiden US.\nThe impact on the net loss and LAE ratios should be considered in conjunction with the commission and other acquisition expense ratio as changes to either ratio arise primarily due to changes in the mix of business and the impact of the increase in the commission and other acquisition expense rates on pro-rata contracts with loss sensitive features. As a result of these factors, the combined ratio (excluding the general and administrative expense ratio) increased by 4.6 points for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014.\nCommission and Other Acquisition Expenses - Commission and other acquisition expenses decreased by $37.4 million, or 16.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. The commission and other acquisition expense ratios decreased to 26.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 26.9% for the same period in 2014. Please refer to the reasons for the changes in the combined ratio discussed in the preceding paragraph.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses - Consistent with the Company's growth, general and administrative expenses decreased by $3.5 million, or 9.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. The general and administrative expense ratio was 4.7% and 4.6% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The overall expense ratio (including commission and other acquisition expenses) was 30.7% and 31.5% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAmTrust Reinsurance Segment\nThe AmTrust Reinsurance segment reported strong growth in premiums in each of the comparative periods reported.

However, the segment experienced an increase in the combined ratio to 98.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 95.3% in 2015 largely due to a fourth quarter reserve charge of $52.0 million related primarily to program commercial auto as well as program general liability.\nPremiums - Gross premiums written increased by $120.7 million or 6.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Growth in our AmTrust Reinsurance segment is due to additional 2016 premium relating to acquisitions made by AmTrust, ceded for the first time, and ongoing organic growth and also reflects the removal of certain classes of business which we commuted with AmTrust in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nThe table below shows net premiums written by this segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Premiums Written\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Small Commercial Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,181,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,057,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty Program\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>344,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>332,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>362,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>388,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26,695\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total AmTrust Reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,888,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,779,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet premiums earned increased by $159.4 million, or 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.

Net loss and LAE ratios were 66.5% and 63.8% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The net loss and LAE ratio increased largely due to the reserve increase in the 4th quarter, which primarily affected program commercial auto as well as program general liability reserves.\nCommission and Other Acquisition Expenses - Commission and other acquisition expenses increased by $57.0 million, or 10.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. The commission and other acquisition expense ratio increased to 31.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 31.3% in 2015. The increase in the ratio during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 reflects the higher proportion of net premiums earned from the Reinsurance Agreement, which has a higher commission rate than the European Hospital Liability Quota Share.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses - General and administrative expenses decreased by $0.1 million, or 4.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The general and administrative expense ratio has remained flat at 0.2% for both years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The overall expense ratio (including commission and other acquisition expenses) was 31.9% and 31.5% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe AmTrust Reinsurance segment continues to experience strong profitable growth during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. The combined ratio decreased slightly to 95.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 95.4% in 2014, generally reflecting this segment's overall stable combined loss ratios.\nPremiums - Gross premiums written increased by $275.5 million or 17.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. This increase reflects the continued ongoing growth, through strategic acquisitions and organically, particularly in U.S. workers' compensation and specialty program business. This increase was offset partially by: 1) the Company entering into an agreement with AmTrust to commute outstanding liabilities, loss reserves and unearned premiums associated with certain classes and lines of business which reduced gross written premiums by approximately 3.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015; and 2) the impact of foreign exchange movements on the non-U.S. dollar business ceded to us by AmTrust.\nThe table below shows net premiums written by this segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Premiums Written\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Small Commercial Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,057,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>857,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty Program\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>332,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>220,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>388,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>532,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(143,838\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total AmTrust Reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,779,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,610,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet premiums earned increased by $305.9 million, or 22.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.

Net loss and LAE ratios were 63.8% and 64.8% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The net loss and LAE ratio has improved primarily due to the continued change in the segment's mix of business.\nCommission and Other Acquisition Expenses - Commission and other acquisition expenses increased by $109.0 million, or 26.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. The commission and other acquisition expense ratio increased to 31.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 30.4% in 2014. The increase in the ratio during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 reflects 1) the higher proportion of net premiums earned from the Reinsurance Agreement, which has a higher commission rate than the European Hospital Liability Quota Share; and 2) increase in Specialty Program business, within which is a component with the highest commission rate in the Reinsurance Agreement of 34.375%.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses - General and administrative expenses increased by $0.5 million, or 19.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The general and administrative expense ratio has remained flat at 0.2% for both years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The overall expense ratio (including commission and other acquisition expenses) was 31.5% and 30.6% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nMaiden Holdings is a holding company and transacts no business of its own. We therefore rely on cash flows in the form of dividends, advances, loans and other permitted distributions from our subsidiary companies to make dividend payments on our common and preference shares. The jurisdictions in which our operating subsidiaries are licensed to write business impose regulations requiring companies to maintain or meet statutory solvency and liquidity requirements. Some jurisdictions also place restrictions on the declaration and payment of dividends and other distributions.\nThe amount of dividends that can be distributed from Maiden Bermuda is, under certain circumstances, limited under Bermuda law and Bermuda regulatory requirements, which requires our Bermuda operating subsidiary to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity in accordance with the BSCR. At December 31, 2016, the statutory capital and surplus of Maiden Bermuda was $1,470.2 million. Maiden Bermuda is allowed to pay dividends or distributions not exceeding $453.4 million. During 2016 and 2015, Maiden Bermuda paid dividends of $445.0 million and $nil, respectively, to Maiden Holdings.\nMaiden US is subject to regulatory restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends by the state of Missouri where it is domiciled. In addition, there are restrictions based on risk-based capital, a test which is the threshold that constitutes the authorized control level. If Maiden US's statutory capital and surplus falls below the authorized control level, the insurance regulator is authorized to take whatever regulatory actions are considered necessary to protect policyholders and creditors. At December 31, 2016, Maiden US has statutory capital and surplus of $296.6 million, which exceeds the required level of minimum statutory capital and surplus by the state of Missouri. During 2016 and 2015, Maiden US paid no dividends.\nMaiden Holdings has two Swedish domiciled operating subsidiaries, Maiden LF and Maiden GF, both regulated by the Swedish FSA. At December 31, 2016, Maiden LF has statutory capital and surplus of $8.1 million, which exceeds the amount required to be maintained of $3.9 million at December 31, 2016. Maiden LF is subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions under the Swedish FSA that limit the maximum amount of annual dividends or distributions paid by Maiden LF to Maiden Holdings. At December 31, 2016, Maiden LF is allowed to pay dividends or distributions not exceeding $2.8 million. During 2016 and 2015, Maiden LF paid no dividends. Maiden GF was granted a general insurance license effective September 14, 2016 with an approved level of initial statutory capital and surplus of $6.1 million. Maiden GF wrote no business in 2016 as such, its first filing with the Swedish FSA will be for the period ending December 31, 2017.\nMaiden Holdings' wholly owned U.K. subsidiary, Maiden Global, operates as a reinsurance services and holding company, is subject to regulation by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \"FCA\") that limit the maximum amount of annual dividends or distributions paid by Maiden Global to the Company. At December 31, 2016, Maiden Global is allowed to pay dividends or distributions not exceeding $2.4 million. During 2016 and 2015, Maiden Global paid no dividends to Maiden Holdings.\nMaiden Global's wholly owned subsidiary in Netherlands, Maiden Nederland B.V. (\"Maiden Nederland\"), operates as an insurance intermediary and is subject to regulation by the Netherlands Authority for Financial Markets (the \"AFM\"). There are no statutory minimum capital requirements imposed on Maiden Nederland by the AFM.\nOur sources of funds primarily consist of premium receipts net of commissions, investment income, net proceeds from capital raising activities, which may include the issuance of common and preference shares, and proceeds from sales and redemption of investments. Cash is used primarily to pay loss and LAE, general and administrative expenses and dividends, with the remainder made available to our investment managers for investment in accordance with our investment policy.\nThe table below summarizes our operating, investing and financing cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>470,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>634,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>651,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(439,204\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(750,678\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(471,884\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(76,780\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(208,390\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on foreign currency cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,849\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,085\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(43,894\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,478\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(31,714\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash flows from operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $470.1 million compared to $634.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a 25.9% decrease. This decrease in cash flows from operating activities arises primarily due to the settlement of the $107.0 million commutation with AmTrust during the first quarter of 2016. Operating cash flows in 2015 were also favorably impacted by AmTrust's integration of Tower Group which now has been completed.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nInvesting cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments and payments for investments acquired. Net cash used in investing activities was $439.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $750.7 million for the same period in 2015. The Company continues to deploy available cash for longer-term investments as investment conditions permit and to maintain, where possible, cash and cash equivalents balances at low levels. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the purchases of fixed maturity securities exceeded the proceeds from the sales, maturities and calls by $578.8 million. This outflow was offset by the decrease in restricted cash and cash equivalents of $138.9 million combined with net proceeds from other investing activities of $0.7 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe net cash (used in) provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was as follows:\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows from Financing Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior notes, net of issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Redemption of 2011 senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(107,500\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Redemption of junior subordinated debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(152,500\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preference shares, net of issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(143\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuance of common shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>592\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchase of common shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(470\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(654\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends paid - Maiden common shareholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43,127\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38,204\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,079\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends paid - preference shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33,756\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,337\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,337\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(76,780\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(208,390\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe cash outflow in 2016 mainly arises from the payment of dividends to both common and preference shareholders of $76.9 million which is $14.3 million higher than in 2015 representing the increase in dividend per common to $0.57 for the year ending December 31, 2016 from $0.53 for the same period in 2015 and the dividend on Preference shares - Series C of $12.4 million following issuance on November 25, 2015. The issuance of the Preference shares - Series C increased the cash provided by financing activities by $159.6 million in 2015.\nRestrictions, Collateral and Specific Requirements\nMaiden Bermuda is neither licensed nor admitted as an insurer, nor is it accredited as a reinsurer, in any jurisdiction in the U.S., except as a certified reinsurer in the State of Missouri. As a result, it is generally required to post collateral security with respect to any reinsurance liabilities it assumes from ceding insurers domiciled in the U.S. in order for U.S. ceding companies to obtain credit on their U.S. statutory financial statements with respect to insurance liabilities ceded to them. Under applicable statutory provisions, the security arrangements may be in the form of letters of credit, reinsurance trusts maintained by trustees or funds withheld arrangements where assets are held by the ceding company.\nMaiden Bermuda was approved as a certified reinsurer in the State of Missouri for purposes of providing reduced collateral for reinsurance reserve credit effective October 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017. Based on a Financial Strength Rating granted of Secure-5, Maiden Bermuda is allowed to post 75% collateral and still enable an authorized insurer to qualify for full reserve credit with respect to reinsurance contracts renewed or entered into on or after the date certified.\nMaiden Bermuda uses trust accounts, loan to related party and letters of credit to meet collateral requirements - consequently, cash and cash equivalents and investments are pledged in favor of ceding companies in order to comply with relevant insurance regulations or contractual requirements.\nMaiden US also offers to its clients, on a voluntary basis, the ability to collateralize certain liabilities related to the reinsurance contracts it issues. Under these arrangements, Maiden retains broad investment discretion in order to achieve its business objectives while giving clients the additional security a collateralized arrangement offers. We believe this offers the Company a significant competitive advantage and improves Maiden US's retention of high-quality clients.\nAt December 31, 2016, total cash and cash equivalents and fixed maturity investments used as collateral were $4.4 billion compared to $3.7 billion at December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in assets provided as collateral for the AmTrust Reinsurance segment reflecting continued growth.\nThe following table details additional information on those assets at December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Restricted Cash &\nEquivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fixed\nMaturities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Restricted Cash &\nEquivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fixed\nMaturities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maiden US\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>994,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,021,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>864,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>935,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maiden Bermuda\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>312,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>343,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>210,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>242,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diversified Reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,307,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,364,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,075,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,178,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maiden Bermuda\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,975,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,020,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,329,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,468,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AmTrust Reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,975,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,020,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,329,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,468,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maiden Bermuda\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,295,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,398,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>242,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,434,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,677,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a % of Consolidated Balance Sheet captions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs part of the Reinsurance Agreement, Maiden Bermuda has also loaned funds to AmTrust totaling $168.0 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, to partially satisfy collateral requirements with AII.\nCollateral arrangements with ceding insurers may subject our assets to security interests or require that a portion of our assets be pledged to, or otherwise held by, third parties. Both our trust accounts and letters of credit are fully collateralized by assets held in custodial accounts. Although the investment income derived from our assets while held in trust accrues to our benefit, the investment of these assets is governed by the terms of the letter of credit facilities or the investment regulations of the state or territory of domicile of the ceding insurer, which may be more restrictive than the investment regulations applicable to us under Bermuda law. The restrictions may result in lower investment yields on these assets, which may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe do not currently anticipate that the restrictions on liquidity resulting from restrictions on the payments of dividends by our subsidiary companies or from assets committed in trust accounts or to collateralize the letter of credit facilities will have a material impact on our ability to carry out our normal business activities, including, our ability to make dividend payments on our common and preference shares.\nInvestments\nThe investment of our funds is designed to ensure safety of principal while generating current income. Accordingly, our funds are invested in liquid, investment-grade fixed income securities which are designated as either AFS or HTM. In both 2015 and 2016, the Company designated certain corporate bonds previously classified as AFS to HTM to reflect our intention of holding these corporate bonds until maturity.

Investments\" included under Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company's AFS fixed maturity investments increased by $463.6 million or 13.2% at December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. The net increase in the fair value of our AFS fixed maturity investments is a combination of (1) net purchases of $1,266.8 million, comprising of primarily asset-backed securities and investment grade corporate bonds and (2) net unrealized gains and amortization of $10.1 million; offset by (3) maturities and calls totaling $657.8 million; and (4) designation of $155.5 million of investment grade corporate bonds as HTM.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond increased by 18 basis points to 2.45%. The 10-year U.S. Treasury is the key risk-free determinant in the fair value of many of the securities in our AFS portfolio. The increase in interest rates during 2016 reflects the adjustments by the U.S. central bank to reflect improving economic indicators, along with expectations that near-term economic conditions would be more influenced by fiscal policy in the U.S. and internationally, as opposed to monetary policy as has been experienced in recent years.\nThe movement in unrealized gain/loss in our AFS fixed maturity portfolio was a gain of $20.8 million, primarily due to an increase in interest rates and an increase in corporate spreads. This gain is net of unrealized foreign exchange losses of $15.1 million arising on our non-U.S. dollar denominated investment portfolio, primarily on our euro-denominated investments, following the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro during the year ended December 31, 2016. These declines were substantially offset by decreases in our non-U.S. dollar net liabilities which are reflected in the movement in our cumulative translation adjustment, which is also a component of AOCI, in our shareholders' equity. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Resources\" on page 90 for further information.\nAt December 31, 2016, we consider the levels of cash and cash equivalents we are holding to be within our targeted ranges. However, during periods when interest rates experience greater volatility, we have periodically maintained more cash and cash equivalents in order to better assess current market conditions and opportunities within our defined risk appetite, and may do so in future periods.\nIn order to limit our exposure to unexpected interest rate increases which would reduce the value of our fixed income securities and reduce our shareholders' equity, we attempt to maintain the duration of our fixed maturity investment portfolio combined with our cash and cash equivalents, both restricted and unrestricted, within a reasonable range of the duration of our loss reserves.\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, these respective durations in years were as follows:\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed maturities and cash

</tr>\n</table>\nThe increase of 0.2 years in the weighted average duration of our fixed maturity investment portfolio arises predominantly due to purchases during the 4th quarter to take advantage of increasing yields with a higher duration than the fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2016 combined with an increase in the duration of our Agency MBS portfolio reflecting the impact of the volatility in interest rates on paydowns.\nThe differential in duration between these assets and liabilities may fluctuate over time and in the case of fixed maturities, is affected by factors such as market conditions, changes in asset mix and prepayment speeds in the case of both our Agency MBS and commercial mortgage-backed securities (\"CMBS\").\nThe average yield and average duration of our fixed maturities, by asset class, and our cash and cash equivalents (restricted and unrestricted) are as follows:\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of the liability. Estimates of ultimate liabilities are contingent on many future events and the eventual outcome of these events may be different from the assumptions underlying the reserve estimates. The Company believes that the recorded unpaid loss and LAE represent management's best estimate of the cost to settle the ultimate liabilities based on information available at December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded gross reserves for unpaid loss and LAE of $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, and net reserves for unpaid loss and LAE of $2.8 billion and $2.4 billion for December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See \"Business - Reserve for Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses\" in Item 1 of Part I of this Report, \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Reserve for Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses\" and \"Results of Operations\" above for a discussion of loss and LAE and prior years' reserve developments.\nOther Balance Sheet Changes\nThe following summarizes other material balance sheet changes of the Company at December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance balances receivable, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>410,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>377,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve for loss and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,896,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,510,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>386,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unearned premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,475,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,354,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe reinsurance balances receivable, net increased by $32.8 million, or 8.7%, primarily due to the continued growth of our AmTrust Reinsurance segment in 2016 compared to 2015, which was lowered by the commutation agreement with AmTrust of $107.0 million. The reserve for net loss and LAE increased following the continued growth in our AmTrust Reinsurance segment combined with adverse development experienced in both our reportable segments including the reserve charge recognized of $120.4 million in all segments including the NGHC run-off business during the fourth quarter. The unearned premiums also increased following the continued growth in our AmTrust Reinsurance segment.\nCapital Resources\nCapital resources consist of funds deployed or available to be deployed in support of our operations.

Long Term Debt\" included under Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the Company's indebtedness.\nWe have, and expect to continue, to fund a portion of our capital requirements through issuances of senior securities, including secured, unsecured and convertible debt securities, or issuances of common or preference shares. On November 9, 2015, we filed an unallocated universal shelf registration statement with the SEC, which became effective upon filing. Pursuant to the shelf registration, from time to time, we may sell any combination of certain securities in one or more offerings. Our intent and ability to issue securities pursuant to this registration statement will depend on market conditions at the time of any proposed offering.\nAggregate Contractual Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is a party to a variety of contractual obligations as summarized below.

Both the amount and timing of cash flows are uncertain and do not have contractual payout terms. For a discussion of these uncertainties, please refer to \"Critical Accounting Policies - Reserve for Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses\" section included under Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Due to the inherent uncertainty in the process of estimating the timing of these payments, there is a risk that the amounts paid in any period will differ significantly from those disclosed. Total estimated obligations will be funded by existing cash and investments.\nCurrency and Foreign Exchange\nWe conduct business in a variety of foreign (non-U.S.) currencies, the principal exposures being the euro, the British pound, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Swedish krona. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, and exchange rate fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar may materially impact our results and financial position. Our principal exposure to foreign currency risk is our obligation to settle claims in foreign currencies. In addition, in order to minimize this risk, we maintain and expect to continue to maintain a portion of our investment portfolio in investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We may employ various strategies (including hedging) to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. To the extent that these exposures are not fully hedged or the hedges are ineffective, our results of operations or equity may be adversely effected. At December 31, 2016, no such hedges or hedging strategies were in force or had been entered into. We measure monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange rates, with the resulting foreign exchange gains and losses recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Revenues and expenses in foreign currencies are converted at average exchange rates during the year. The effect of the translation adjustments for foreign operations is included in AOCI.\nNet foreign exchange gains amounted to $13.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $7.4 million and $3.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nEffects of Inflation\nThe effects of inflation are considered implicitly in pricing and estimating reserves for loss and LAE. The effects of inflation could cause the severity of claims to rise in the future. To the extent inflation causes these costs, particularly medical treatments and litigation costs, to increase above reserves established for these claims, the Company will be required to increase the reserve for loss and LAE with a corresponding reduction in its earnings in the period in which the deficiency is identified. The actual effects of inflation on the results of operations of the Company cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Item 303(a) (4) of Regulation S-K.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1, \"Business - General Overview\" on page 2. Amounts in tables may not reconcile due to rounding differences. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Report, including information with respect to the Company's plans and strategy for its business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Please see the \"Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by any forward-looking statements contained in this discussion and analysis. You should review the \"Risk Factors\" set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained herein.\nOverview\nWe are a Bermuda-based holding company formed in June 2007 primarily focused on serving the needs of regional and specialty insurers in the U.S. and Europe by providing innovative reinsurance solutions designed to support their capital needs. We specialize in reinsurance solutions that optimize financing by providing coverage within the more predictable and actuarially credible lower layers of coverage and/or reinsuring risks that are believed to be lower hazard, more predictable and generally not susceptible to significant claims from natural catastrophes. Our tailored solutions include a variety of value added services focused on helping our clients grow and prosper.\nWe have operations in Bermuda and the U.S. which provide reinsurance through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Maiden Bermuda and Maiden US. Maiden Bermuda and Maiden US do not underwrite any primary insurance business. Maiden LF is a life insurer organized in Sweden and writes credit life insurance on a primary basis in support of Maiden Global business development efforts.\nOur business consists of two reportable segments: Diversified Reinsurance and AmTrust Reinsurance. Please refer to Item 1, \"Business - Our Reportable Segments\" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 for a discussion on our reportable segments.\nRecent Developments\nThe following are strategic and capital transactions that occurred during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nConversion of Mandatory Convertible Preference Shares - Series B\nMost recently, on September 15, 2016, the Company's $165.0 million mandatory convertible preference shares - Series B were automatically converted into 12,069,090 of the Company's common shares at a conversion rate of 3.6573 per preference share.\nIssuance of 2016 Senior Notes and Redemption of 2011 Senior Notes\nOn June 14, 2016, Maiden Holdings issued $110.0 million 6.625% Senior Notes and used the cash proceeds to fully redeem all of Maiden NA's 8.25% 2011 Senior Notes due 2041 on June 15, 2016, thus lowering our cost of capital.\nIssuance of Preference Shares - Series C\nOn November 25, 2015, the Company issued 6.6 million shares of 7.125% Preference Shares - Series C, par value $0.01, at a price of $25 per preference share. The Company received net proceeds of $159.5 million from the offering after deducting issuance costs of $5.5 million. Each share, which is redeemable at the Company's sole option beginning December 15, 2020, will be paid non-cumulative dividends at a rate of 7.125% per annum on the initial liquidation preference of $25 per share.\nThe Preference Shares - Series C have no voting rights other than to elect two additional members of the board of directors if dividends on the Preference Shares - Series C have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend periods. The Preference Shares - Series C have been listed on NYSE and trading commenced on November 27, 2015 under the symbol \"MHPRC\".\nSale of Maiden Specialty\nOn November 4, 2015, Maiden US finalized the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, Maiden Specialty, to Clear Blue. On the same date, Maiden US entered into a reinsurance agreement with Clear Blue whereby Maiden US reinsures all in-force policies transferred to Clear Blue as part of the sale. In addition, Maiden US entered into an agreement with Clear Blue whereby Maiden US assumes the responsibility for the administration and servicing of all aspects of the polices in-force at the date of sale.\n2016 Financial Highlights\n\n\n (1) Operating earnings, operating earnings per common share and operating return on average common equity are non-GAAP financial measures. See \"Key Financial Measures\" for additional information and a reconciliation to the nearest U.S. GAAP financial measure (net income). \n (2) Please refer to \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12. Earnings per Common Share\" included under Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share. \n (3) Underwriting income is calculated as net premiums earned plus other insurance revenue less net loss and LAE, commission and other acquisition expenses and general and administrative expenses directly related to underwriting activities. \n (4) Calculated by adding together the net loss and LAE ratio, commission and other acquisition expense ratio and general and administrative expense ratio. \n (5) Total investments and cash and cash equivalents includes both restricted and unrestricted. \n (6) Total capital resources is the sum of the Company's principal amount of debt and Maiden shareholders' equity. See \"Key Financial Measures\" for additional information. \n (7) Book value per common share is calculated using common shareholders' equity (shareholders' equity excluding the aggregate liquidation value of our preference shares) divided by the number of common shares outstanding. \n (8) Diluted book value per common share is calculated by dividing common shareholders' equity, adjusted for assumed proceeds from the exercise of dilutive options, by the number of outstanding common shares plus dilutive options and restricted share units (assuming exercise of all dilutive share based awards). The Mandatory Convertible Preference Shares - Series B, which were converted into common shares on September 15, 2016, are excluded at December 31, 2015 as they are anti-dilutive. \nKey Financial Measures\nIn addition to the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, management uses certain key financial measures, some of which are non-GAAP measures, to evaluate its financial performance and the overall growth in value generated for the Company's common shareholders. Management believes that these measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, better explain the Company's results in a manner that allows for a more complete understanding of the underlying trends in the Company's business. The non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These key financial measures are:\nOperating Earnings and Operating Earnings per Common Share: Management believes that the use of operating earnings and diluted operating earnings per share enables investors and other users of the Company's financial information to analyze its performance in a manner similar to how Management analyzes performance. Management also believes that these measures follow industry practice and, therefore, allow the users of financial information to compare the Company's performance with its industry peer group, and that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies which follow the Company, and the insurance industry as a whole, generally exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income.\nOperating earnings are an internal performance measure used by management as these measures focus on the underlying fundamentals of the Company's operations by excluding, on a recurring basis: (1) net realized gains or losses on investment; (2) impairment losses related to investments which were recognized in earnings; (3) foreign exchange and other gains or losses; (4) amortization of intangible assets; (5) loss and related activity from our run-off operations comprised of our former segment NGHC Quota Share and our divested E&S business; and (6) non-cash deferred tax expenses. We exclude net realized gains or losses on investment, impairment losses related to investments, and foreign exchange and other gains or losses as we believe these are influenced by market opportunities and other factors. We do not believe amortization of intangible assets and loss and related activity from our run-off operations are representative of our ongoing business. We believe all of these amounts are largely independent of our business and underwriting process and including them distorts the analysis of trends in our operations.\nIn addition to the recurring exclusions above, we also exclude certain non-recurring items that are material to understanding our results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we excluded the accelerated amortization of the 2011 Senior Notes issuance costs which was redeemed on June 15, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2014, we excluded: (1) the interest expense incurred on our 2013 Senior Notes prior to the redemption of the outstanding junior subordinated debt given the one time nature of the additional funding cost and (2) the accelerated amortization of the junior subordinated debt discount and the write-off of the associated issuance costs.\nOperating earnings and diluted operating earnings per common share can be reconciled to the nearest U.S. GAAP financial measure as follows:\n\nOperating earnings attributable to Maiden common shareholders decreased by $89.9 million, or 83.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015. This underwriting loss was caused by a $120.4 million increase in our provision for losses implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016, largely due to adverse development in our commercial auto line of business. The decline in underwriting results in 2016 was partially offset by increases in net investment income.\nOperating Return on Average Common Equity (\"Operating ROACE\"): Management uses operating return on average common shareholders' equity as a measure of profitability that focuses on the return to common shareholders. It is calculated using operating earnings available to common shareholders (as defined above) divided by average common shareholders' equity. Management has set, as a target, a long-term average of 15% Operating ROACE, which management believes provides an attractive return to shareholders for the risk assumed from our business.\nOperating ROACE for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was computed as follows:\n\n (1) Average common shareholders' equity for the year ended December 31, 2016 is adjusted for the period the Mandatory Convertible Preference Shares - Series B are outstanding (prior to mandatory conversion date of September 15, 2016). \nBook Value per Common Share and Diluted Book Value per Common Share: Management uses growth in both of these metrics as a prime measure of the value we are generating for our common shareholders, as management believes that growth in each metric ultimately results in growth in the Company's common share price. These metrics are impacted by the Company's net income and external factors, such as interest rates, which can drive changes in unrealized gains or losses on our investment portfolio. At December 31, 2016, the book value per common share and the diluted book value per common share increased by 3.0% and 3.4% respectively, compared to December 31, 2015, (see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Investments\" on page 83 for further information). Book value and diluted book value per common share at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were computed as follows:\n\nRatio of Debt to Total Capital Resources: Management uses this measure to monitor the financial leverage of the Company. This measure is calculated using total principal amount of debt divided by the sum of total Maiden shareholders' equity and total principal amount of debt. The ratio of Debt to Total Capital Resources at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was computed as follows:\n\nUnderwriting income and Combined ratio: The combined ratio is used in the insurance and reinsurance industry as a measure of underwriting profitability. Management measures underwriting results on an overall basis and for each segment on the basis of the combined ratio. The combined ratio is the sum of the net loss and LAE ratio and the expense ratio and the computations of each component are described below. A combined ratio under 100% indicates underwriting profitability, as the net loss and LAE, commission and other acquisition expenses and general and administrative expenses are less than the net premiums earned and other insurance revenue on that business. Prior to 2016, we have generated underwriting income in each year since inception. In 2016, we generated an underwriting loss due to our fourth quarter reserve charge of $120.4 million. Underwriting income is calculated by subtracting net loss and LAE, commissions and other acquisition expenses and applicable general and administrative expenses from the net premiums earned and other insurance revenue and is the monetized counterpart of the combined ratio. For purposes of these operating measures, the fee-generating business which is included in our Diversified Reinsurance segment, is considered part of the underwriting operations of the Company.\nWhile an important metric of success, underwriting income and combined ratio do not reflect all components of profitability, as they do not recognize the impact of investment income earned on premiums between the time premiums are received and the time loss payments are ultimately paid to clients. Because we do not manage our cash and investments by segment, investment income and interest expense are not allocated to individual reportable segments. Certain general and administrative expenses are allocated to segments based on various factors, including staff count and each segment's proportional share of gross premiums written.\nThe \"net loss and LAE ratio\" is derived by dividing net loss and LAE by the sum of net premiums earned and other insurance revenue. The \"commission and other acquisition expense ratio\" is derived by dividing commission and other acquisition expenses by the sum of net premiums earned and other insurance revenue. The \"general and administrative expense ratio\" is derived by dividing general and administrative expenses by the sum of net premiums earned and other insurance revenue. The \"expense ratio\" is the sum of the commission and other acquisition expense ratio and the general and administrative expense ratio.\nRelevant Factors\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues primarily from premiums on our insurance policies and reinsurance contracts, net of any reinsurance or retrocessional coverage purchased. Insurance and reinsurance premiums are a function of the amounts and types of policies and contracts we write, as well as prevailing market prices. Our prices are determined before our ultimate costs, which may extend far into the future, are known.\nThe Company's revenues also include fee income as well as income generated from our investment portfolio. The Company's investment portfolio is comprised of fixed maturity investments, currently held as AFS and HTM, and other investments. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these investments, except for HTM fixed maturities, are carried at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings. These unrealized gains and losses are included on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") as a separate component of shareholders' equity. If unrealized losses are considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired due to a credit event, such losses are included in earnings as a realized loss.\nExpenses\nOur expenses consist largely of net loss and LAE, commission and other acquisition expenses, general and administrative expenses, interest and amortization expenses, amortization of intangible assets and foreign exchange and other gains or losses.\nNet loss and LAE has three main components:\n \u2022 losses paid, which are actual cash payments to insureds, net of recoveries from reinsurers; \n \u2022 change in outstanding loss or case reserves, which represent cedants' best estimate of the likely settlement amount for known claims, less the portion that can be recovered from reinsurers; and \n \u2022 change in IBNR reserves, which are reserves established by us for changes in the values of claims that have been reported to us but are not yet settled, as well as claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us. The portion recoverable from our reinsurers is deducted from the gross estimated loss. \nCommission and other acquisition expenses include commissions, brokerage fees and insurance taxes. Commissions and brokerage fees are usually calculated as a percentage of premiums and depend on the market and line of business and can, in certain instances, vary based on loss sensitive features of reinsurance contracts. Commission and other acquisition expenses are reported after: (1) deducting commissions received on ceded reinsurance; (2) deducting the part of commission and other acquisition expenses relating to unearned premiums; and (3) including the amortization of previously deferred commission and other acquisition expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include personnel expenses (including share-based compensation expense), rent expense, professional fees, information technology costs and other general operating expenses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIt is important to understand our accounting policies in order to understand our financial position and results of operations. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The following presents a discussion of those accounting policies and estimates that management believes are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgment. If actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions and estimates used by management, there could be material adjustments to prior estimates that could potentially adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in conjunction with \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies\" included under Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K for a full understanding of the Company's accounting policies.\nReserve for Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nGeneral: The amount of time that elapses before a claim is reported to the cedant and then subsequently reported to the reinsurer is commonly referred to in the industry as the reporting tail. Lines of business for which claims are reported quickly are commonly referred to as short-tailed lines; and lines of business for which a longer period of time elapses before claims are reported to the reinsurer are commonly referred to as long-tailed lines. In general, for reinsurance, the time lags are longer than for primary business due to the delay that occurs between the cedant becoming aware of a loss and reporting the information to its reinsurer(s). The delay varies by reinsurance market (country of cedant), type of treaty, whether losses are paid by the cedant and the size of the loss. The delay could vary from a few weeks to a year or sometimes longer.\nBecause a significant amount of time can elapse, particularly on longer-tail lines of business, between the assumption of risk, the occurrence of a loss event, the reporting of the event to an insurance company (the primary company or the cedant), the subsequent reporting to the reinsurance company (\"the reinsurer\") and the ultimate payment of the claim on the loss event by the reinsurer, the Company's liability for unpaid loss and LAE (\"loss reserves\") is based largely upon estimates. The Company categorizes loss reserves into two types of reserves: reported outstanding loss reserves (\"case reserves\") and IBNR reserves. Case reserves represent, for each individual claim, an estimate of unpaid losses, either by the Company's cedants or the Company's claims handling professionals, and recorded by the Company. IBNR reserves represent a provision for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the Company, as well as future loss development on losses already reported, in excess of the case reserves. The Company updates its estimates for each of the aforementioned categories on a quarterly basis using information received from its cedants.\nFor excess of loss treaties, cedents generally are required to report losses that either (i) exceed 50% of their retention; or (ii) have a reasonable probability of exceeding the retention; or (iii) meet defined reporting criteria. All reinsurance claims that are reserved are reviewed at least every six months. In addition, reserves for loss and LAE are reviewed every quarter for each cedant. For proportional treaties, cedents are required to give a periodic statement of account, generally monthly or quarterly. These periodic statements typically include information regarding written premiums, earned premiums, unearned premiums, ceding commissions, brokerage amounts, applicable taxes, paid losses and outstanding losses. They can be submitted up to 90 days after the close of the reporting period. Some proportional treaties have specific language requiring earlier notice of serious claims.\nFor all lines, the Company's objective is to estimate ultimate loss and LAE. Total loss reserves are then calculated by subtracting losses paid. Similarly, IBNR reserves are calculated by subtraction of case reserves from total loss reserves. IBNR is the estimated liability for (1) changes in the values of claims that have been reported to us but are not yet settled, as well as (2) claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported as well as (3) claims that are closed but subsequently reopen. Each claim is settled individually based upon its merits, and particularly for longer-tailed lines of business, it is not unusual for a claim to take years after being reported to settle, especially if legal action is involved. As a result, the reserve for loss and LAE include significant estimates for IBNR reserves.\nThe reserve for IBNR is estimated by", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1, \"Business - General Overview\" on page 2. Amounts in tables may not reconcile due to rounding differences. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Report, including information with respect to the Company's plans and strategy for its business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Please see the \"Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by any forward-looking statements contained in this discussion and analysis. You should review the \"Risk Factors\" set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained herein.\nOverview\nWe are a Bermuda-based holding company formed in June 2007 primarily focused on serving the needs of regional and specialty insurers in the U.S. and Europe by providing innovative reinsurance solutions designed to support their capital needs. We specialize in reinsurance solutions that optimize financing by providing coverage within the more predictable and actuarially credible lower layers of coverage and/or reinsuring risks that are believed to be lower hazard, more predictable and generally not susceptible to significant claims from natural catastrophes. Our tailored solutions include a variety of value added services focused on helping our clients grow and prosper.\nWe have operations in Bermuda and the U.S. which provide reinsurance through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Maiden Bermuda and Maiden US. Maiden Bermuda and Maiden US do not underwrite any primary insurance business. Maiden LF is a life insurer organized in Sweden and writes credit life insurance on a primary basis in support of Maiden Global business development efforts.\nOur business consists of two reportable segments: Diversified Reinsurance and AmTrust Reinsurance. Please refer to Item 1, \"Business - Our Reportable Segments\" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 for a discussion on our reportable segments.\nRecent Developments\nThe following are strategic and capital transactions that occurred during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nConversion of Mandatory Convertible Preference Shares - Series B\nMost recently, on September 15, 2016, the Company's $165.0 million mandatory convertible preference shares - Series B were automatically converted into 12,069,090 of the Company's common shares at a conversion rate of 3.6573 per preference share.\nIssuance of 2016 Senior Notes and Redemption of 2011 Senior Notes\nOn June 14, 2016, Maiden Holdings issued $110.0 million 6.625% Senior Notes and used the cash proceeds to fully redeem all of Maiden NA's 8.25% 2011 Senior Notes due 2041 on June 15, 2016, thus lowering our cost of capital.\nIssuance of Preference Shares - Series C\nOn November 25, 2015, the Company issued 6.6 million shares of 7.125% Preference Shares - Series C, par value $0.01, at a price of $25 per preference share. The Company received net proceeds of $159.5 million from the offering after deducting issuance costs of $5.5 million. Each share, which is redeemable at the Company's sole option beginning December 15, 2020, will be paid non-cumulative dividends at a rate of 7.125% per annum on the initial liquidation preference of $25 per share.\nThe Preference Shares - Series C have no voting rights other than to elect two additional members of the board of directors if dividends on the Preference Shares - Series C have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend periods. The Preference Shares - Series C have been listed on NYSE and trading commenced on November 27, 2015 under the symbol \"MHPRC\".\nSale of Maiden Specialty\nOn November 4, 2015, Maiden US finalized the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, Maiden Specialty, to Clear Blue. On the same date, Maiden US entered into a reinsurance agreement with Clear Blue whereby Maiden US reinsures all in-force policies transferred to Clear Blue as part of the sale. In addition, Maiden US entered into an agreement with Clear Blue whereby Maiden US assumes the responsibility for the administration and servicing of all aspects of the polices in-force at the date of sale.\n2016 Financial Highlights\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Summary Consolidated Statement of Income Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in Thousands except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Maiden common shareholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(84.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic earnings per common share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Maiden common shareholders(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(85.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating earnings attributable to Maiden common shareholders(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(84.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per common share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Maiden common shareholders(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(85.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating earnings attributable to Maiden common shareholders(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(84.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends per common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross premiums written\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,831,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,662,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,568,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,429,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting (loss) income(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53,180\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(219.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized operating return on average common shareholders' equity(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(84.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Financial Condition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in Thousands except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments and cash and cash equivalents(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,886,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,460,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,252,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,703,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve for loss and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,896,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,510,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior notes -

See \"Key Financial Measures\" for additional information and a reconciliation to the nearest U.S. GAAP financial measure (net income). \n (2) Please refer to \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12. Earnings per Common Share\" included under Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share. \n (3) Underwriting income is calculated as net premiums earned plus other insurance revenue less net loss and LAE, commission and other acquisition expenses and general and administrative expenses directly related to underwriting activities. \n (4) Calculated by adding together the net loss and LAE ratio, commission and other acquisition expense ratio and general and administrative expense ratio. \n (5) Total investments and cash and cash equivalents includes both restricted and unrestricted. \n (6) Total capital resources is the sum of the Company's principal amount of debt and Maiden shareholders' equity. See \"Key Financial Measures\" for additional information. \n (7) Book value per common share is calculated using common shareholders' equity (shareholders' equity excluding the aggregate liquidation value of our preference shares) divided by the number of common shares outstanding. \n (8) Diluted book value per common share is calculated by dividing common shareholders' equity, adjusted for assumed proceeds from the exercise of dilutive options, by the number of outstanding common shares plus dilutive options and restricted share units (assuming exercise of all dilutive share based awards). The Mandatory Convertible Preference Shares - Series B, which were converted into common shares on September 15, 2016, are excluded at December 31, 2015 as they are anti-dilutive. \nKey Financial Measures\nIn addition to the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, management uses certain key financial measures, some of which are non-GAAP measures, to evaluate its financial performance and the overall growth in value generated for the Company's common shareholders. Management believes that these measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, better explain the Company's results in a manner that allows for a more complete understanding of the underlying trends in the Company's business. The non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These key financial measures are:\nOperating Earnings and Operating Earnings per Common Share: Management believes that the use of operating earnings and diluted operating earnings per share enables investors and other users of the Company's financial information to analyze its performance in a manner similar to how Management analyzes performance. Management also believes that these measures follow industry practice and, therefore, allow the users of financial information to compare the Company's performance with its industry peer group, and that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies which follow the Company, and the insurance industry as a whole, generally exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income.\nOperating earnings are an internal performance measure used by management as these measures focus on the underlying fundamentals of the Company's operations by excluding, on a recurring basis: (1) net realized gains or losses on investment; (2) impairment losses related to investments which were recognized in earnings; (3) foreign exchange and other gains or losses; (4) amortization of intangible assets; (5) loss and related activity from our run-off operations comprised of our former segment NGHC Quota Share and our divested E&S business; and (6) non-cash deferred tax expenses. We exclude net realized gains or losses on investment, impairment losses related to investments, and foreign exchange and other gains or losses as we believe these are influenced by market opportunities and other factors. We do not believe amortization of intangible assets and loss and related activity from our run-off operations are representative of our ongoing business. We believe all of these amounts are largely independent of our business and underwriting process and including them distorts the analysis of trends in our operations.\nIn addition to the recurring exclusions above, we also exclude certain non-recurring items that are material to understanding our results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we excluded the accelerated amortization of the 2011 Senior Notes issuance costs which was redeemed on June 15, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2014, we excluded: (1) the interest expense incurred on our 2013 Senior Notes prior to the redemption of the outstanding junior subordinated debt given the one time nature of the additional funding cost and (2) the accelerated amortization of the junior subordinated debt discount and the write-off of the associated issuance costs.\nOperating earnings and diluted operating earnings per common share can be reconciled to the nearest U.S. GAAP financial measure as follows:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

attributable to Maiden common shareholders decreased by $89.9 million, or 83.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015. This underwriting loss was caused by a $120.4 million increase in our provision for losses implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016, largely due to adverse development in our commercial auto line of business. The decline in underwriting results in 2016 was partially offset by increases in net investment income.\nOperating Return on Average Common Equity (\"Operating ROACE\"): Management uses operating return on average common shareholders' equity as a measure of profitability that focuses on the return to common shareholders. It is calculated using operating earnings available to common shareholders (as defined above) divided by average common shareholders' equity.

Management measures underwriting results on an overall basis and for each segment on the basis of the combined ratio. The combined ratio is the sum of the net loss and LAE ratio and the expense ratio and the computations of each component are described below. A combined ratio under 100% indicates underwriting profitability, as the net loss and LAE, commission and other acquisition expenses and general and administrative expenses are less than the net premiums earned and other insurance revenue on that business. Prior to 2016, we have generated underwriting income in each year since inception. In 2016, we generated an underwriting loss due to our fourth quarter reserve charge of $120.4 million. Underwriting income is calculated by subtracting net loss and LAE, commissions and other acquisition expenses and applicable general and administrative expenses from the net premiums earned and other insurance revenue and is the monetized counterpart of the combined ratio. For purposes of these operating measures, the fee-generating business which is included in our Diversified Reinsurance segment, is considered part of the underwriting operations of the Company.\nWhile an important metric of success, underwriting income and combined ratio do not reflect all components of profitability, as they do not recognize the impact of investment income earned on premiums between the time premiums are received and the time loss payments are ultimately paid to clients. Because we do not manage our cash and investments by segment, investment income and interest expense are not allocated to individual reportable segments. Certain general and administrative expenses are allocated to segments based on various factors, including staff count and each segment's proportional share of gross premiums written.\nThe \"net loss and LAE ratio\" is derived by dividing net loss and LAE by the sum of net premiums earned and other insurance revenue. The \"commission and other acquisition expense ratio\" is derived by dividing commission and other acquisition expenses by the sum of net premiums earned and other insurance revenue. The \"general and administrative expense ratio\" is derived by dividing general and administrative expenses by the sum of net premiums earned and other insurance revenue. The \"expense ratio\" is the sum of the commission and other acquisition expense ratio and the general and administrative expense ratio.\nRelevant Factors\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues primarily from premiums on our insurance policies and reinsurance contracts, net of any reinsurance or retrocessional coverage purchased. Insurance and reinsurance premiums are a function of the amounts and types of policies and contracts we write, as well as prevailing market prices. Our prices are determined before our ultimate costs, which may extend far into the future, are known.\nThe Company's revenues also include fee income as well as income generated from our investment portfolio. The Company's investment portfolio is comprised of fixed maturity investments, currently held as AFS and HTM, and other investments. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these investments, except for HTM fixed maturities, are carried at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings. These unrealized gains and losses are included on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") as a separate component of shareholders' equity. If unrealized losses are considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired due to a credit event, such losses are included in earnings as a realized loss.\nExpenses\nOur expenses consist largely of net loss and LAE, commission and other acquisition expenses, general and administrative expenses, interest and amortization expenses, amortization of intangible assets and foreign exchange and other gains or losses.\nNet loss and LAE has three main components:\n \u2022 losses paid, which are actual cash payments to insureds, net of recoveries from reinsurers; \n \u2022 change in outstanding loss or case reserves, which represent cedants' best estimate of the likely settlement amount for known claims, less the portion that can be recovered from reinsurers; and \n \u2022 change in IBNR reserves, which are reserves established by us for changes in the values of claims that have been reported to us but are not yet settled, as well as claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us. The portion recoverable from our reinsurers is deducted from the gross estimated loss. \nCommission and other acquisition expenses include commissions, brokerage fees and insurance taxes. Commissions and brokerage fees are usually calculated as a percentage of premiums and depend on the market and line of business and can, in certain instances, vary based on loss sensitive features of reinsurance contracts. Commission and other acquisition expenses are reported after: (1) deducting commissions received on ceded reinsurance; (2) deducting the part of commission and other acquisition expenses relating to unearned premiums; and (3) including the amortization of previously deferred commission and other acquisition expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include personnel expenses (including share-based compensation expense), rent expense, professional fees, information technology costs and other general operating expenses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIt is important to understand our accounting policies in order to understand our financial position and results of operations. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The following presents a discussion of those accounting policies and estimates that management believes are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgment. If actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions and estimates used by management, there could be material adjustments to prior estimates that could potentially adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in conjunction with \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies\" included under Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K for a full understanding of the Company's accounting policies.\nReserve for Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nGeneral: The amount of time that elapses before a claim is reported to the cedant and then subsequently reported to the reinsurer is commonly referred to in the industry as the reporting tail. Lines of business for which claims are reported quickly are commonly referred to as short-tailed lines; and lines of business for which a longer period of time elapses before claims are reported to the reinsurer are commonly referred to as long-tailed lines. In general, for reinsurance, the time lags are longer than for primary business due to the delay that occurs between the cedant becoming aware of a loss and reporting the information to its reinsurer(s). The delay varies by reinsurance market (country of cedant), type of treaty, whether losses are paid by the cedant and the size of the loss. The delay could vary from a few weeks to a year or sometimes longer.\nBecause a significant amount of time can elapse, particularly on longer-tail lines of business, between the assumption of risk, the occurrence of a loss event, the reporting of the event to an insurance company (the primary company or the cedant), the subsequent reporting to the reinsurance company (\"the reinsurer\") and the ultimate payment of the claim on the loss event by the reinsurer, the Company's liability for unpaid loss and LAE (\"loss reserves\") is based largely upon estimates. The Company categorizes loss reserves into two types of reserves: reported outstanding loss reserves (\"case reserves\") and IBNR reserves. Case reserves represent, for each individual claim, an estimate of unpaid losses, either by the Company's cedants or the Company's claims handling professionals, and recorded by the Company. IBNR reserves represent a provision for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the Company, as well as future loss development on losses already reported, in excess of the case reserves. The Company updates its estimates for each of the aforementioned categories on a quarterly basis using information received from its cedants.\nFor excess of loss treaties, cedents generally are required to report losses that either (i) exceed 50% of their retention; or (ii) have a reasonable probability of exceeding the retention; or (iii) meet defined reporting criteria. All reinsurance claims that are reserved are reviewed at least every six months. In addition, reserves for loss and LAE are reviewed every quarter for each cedant. For proportional treaties, cedents are required to give a periodic statement of account, generally monthly or quarterly. These periodic statements typically include information regarding written premiums, earned premiums, unearned premiums, ceding commissions, brokerage amounts, applicable taxes, paid losses and outstanding losses. They can be submitted up to 90 days after the close of the reporting period. Some proportional treaties have specific language requiring earlier notice of serious claims.\nFor all lines, the Company's objective is to estimate ultimate loss and LAE. Total loss reserves are then calculated by subtracting losses paid. Similarly, IBNR reserves are calculated by subtraction of case reserves from total loss reserves. IBNR is the estimated liability for (1) changes in the values of claims that have been reported to us but are not yet settled, as well as (2) claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported as well as (3) claims that are closed but subsequently reopen. Each claim is settled individually based upon its merits, and particularly for longer-tailed lines of business, it is not unusual for a claim to take years after being reported to settle, especially if legal action is involved. As a result, the reserve for loss and LAE include significant estimates for IBNR reserves.\nThe reserve for IBNR is estimated by"}
