MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Apollo Global Management, Inc.'s consolidated financial statements and the related notes as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ significantly from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those included in the section of this report entitled Item 1A Risk Factors.\u201d The highlights listed below have had significant effects on many items within our consolidated financial statements and affect the comparison of the current period's activity with those of prior periods.\nGeneral\nOur Businesses\nFounded in 1990, Apollo is a leading global alternative investment manager. We are a contrarian, value-oriented investment manager in credit, private equity and real assets with significant distressed expertise and a flexible mandate in the majority of our funds which enables our funds to invest opportunistically across a company's capital structure. We raise, invest and manage funds on behalf of some of the world's most prominent pension, endowment and sovereign wealth funds as well as other institutional and individual investors. Apollo is led by our Managing Partners, Leon Black, Joshua Harris and Marc Rowan, who have worked together for more than 34 years and lead a team of 1,729 employees, including 557 investment professionals, as of December 31, 2020.\nApollo conducts its business primarily in the United States through the following three reportable segments:\n(i)Credit-primarily invests in non-control corporate and structured debt instruments including performing, stressed and distressed instruments across the capital structure;\n(ii)Private equity-primarily invests in control equity and related debt instruments, convertible securities and distressed debt instruments; and\n(iii)Real assets-primarily invests in (i) real estate equity and infrastructure equity for the acquisition and recapitalization of real estate and infrastructure assets, portfolios, platforms and operating companies, (ii) real estate and infrastructure debt including first mortgage and mezzanine loans, preferred equity and commercial mortgage backed securities and (iii) European performing and non-performing loans, and unsecured consumer loans.\nThese business segments are differentiated based on the varying investment strategies. The performance is measured by management on an unconsolidated basis because management makes operating decisions and assesses the performance of each of Apollo's business segments based on financial and operating metrics and data that exclude the effects of consolidation of any of the managed funds.\nOur financial results vary since performance fees, which generally constitute a large portion of the income we receive from the funds that we manage, as well as the transaction and advisory fees that we receive, can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. As a result, we emphasize long-term financial growth and profitability to manage our business.\nIn addition, the growth in our Fee-Generating AUM during the last year has primarily been in our credit segment driven by continued growth in traditional funds and managed accounts as well as growth in asset management services to the insurance industry and in performing credit products. The average management fee rate for these new credit products is at market rates for such products and in certain cases is below our historical rates. Also, due to the complexity of these new product offerings, the Company has incurred and will continue to incur additional costs associated with managing these products. To date, these additional costs have been offset by realized economies of scale and ongoing cost management.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had total AUM of $455.5 billion across all of our businesses. More than 90% of our total AUM was in funds with a contractual life at inception of five years or more, and 60% of such AUM was in permanent capital vehicles.\nThe following table presents the gross and net returns for Apollo's credit segment by category type:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross Returns </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Returns </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Category </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate Credit </td> <td> </td> <td>6.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Structured Credit </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct Origination </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn December 31, 2017, Fund IX held its final closing, raising a total of $23.5 billion in third-party capital and approximately $1.2 billion of additional capital from Apollo and affiliated investors for total commitments of $24.7 billion. On December 31, 2013, Fund VIII held a final closing raising a total of $17.5 billion in third-party capital and approximately $880 million of additional capital from Apollo and affiliated investors, and as of December 31, 2020, Fund VIII had $2.5 billion of uncalled commitments remaining. Additionally, Fund VII held a final closing in December 2008, raising a total of $14.7 billion, and as of December 31, 2020, Fund VII had $1.8 billion of uncalled commitments remaining. We have consistently produced attractive long-term investment returns in our traditional private equity funds, generating a 39% gross IRR and a 24% net IRR on a compound annual basis from inception through December 31, 2020. Apollo's private equity fund appreciation was 6.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nFor our real assets segment, there was a total gross return of 1.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020, which represents gross return for our real estate equity funds and their co-investment capital, the European principal finance funds, and infrastructure equity funds.\nFor further detail related to fund performance metrics across all of our businesses, see -The Historical Investment Performance of Our Funds.\u201d\nHolding Company Structure\nThe diagram below depicts our current organizational structure:\nNote: The organizational structure chart above depicts a simplified version of the Apollo structure. It does not include all legal entities in the structure. Ownership percentages are as of February 18, 2021. As of February 18, 2021, there were 231,966,014 Class A shares, 1 Class B share and 1 Class C share issued and outstanding, and 173,178,263 AOG Units held by Holdings that are exchangeable for Class A shares on a one-for-one basis. In addition, as of February 18, 2021, Athene held 29,154,519 AOG Units that are non-voting equity interests of the Apollo Operating Group and are not exchangeable for Class A shares.\n(1)As of February 18, 2021, the Class A shares represented 9.2% of the total voting power of the Class A shares, the Class B share and the Class C share, voting together as a single class, with respect to General Stockholder Matters. As of February 18, 2021, the Class A shares represented 53.4% of the total voting power of the Class A shares and the Class B share with respect to certain matters upon which they are entitled to vote pursuant to the certificate of incorporation of AGM Inc. ( COI\u201d).\n(2)Our Managing Partners own BRH Holdings GP, Ltd., which in turn holds our only outstanding Class B share. As of February 18, 2021, the Class B share represented 8.0% of the total voting power of the Class A shares, the Class B share and the Class C share, voting together as a single class, with respect to General Stockholder Matters, and a de minimus economic interest in AGM Inc. As of February 18, 2021, the Class B share represented 46.6% of the total voting power of the Class A shares and the Class B share with respect to certain matters upon which they are entitled to vote as a single class.\n(3)Through BRH Holdings, L.P., our Managing Partners indirectly beneficially own through estate planning vehicles, limited partner interests in Holdings. Our Managing Partners' economic interests are represented by their indirect beneficial ownership, through Holdings, of 36.1% of the limited partner interests in the Apollo Operating Group.\n(4)Holdings owns 39.9% of the limited partner or limited liability company interests in each Apollo Operating Group entity. The AOG Units held by Holdings are exchangeable for Class A shares. Our Managing Partners, through their interests in BRH and Holdings, beneficially own 36.1% of the AOG Units. Our Contributing Partners, through their interests in Holdings, beneficially own 3.8% of the AOG Units.\n(5)BRH Holdings GP, Ltd. is the sole member of AGM Management, LLC, which in turns holds our only outstanding Class C share. The Class C share bestows to its holder certain management rights over AGM Inc. As of February 18, 2021, the Class C share represented 82.8% of the total voting power of the Class A shares, the Class B share and the Class C share, voting together as a single class, with respect to General Stockholder Matters, and a de minimus economic interest in AGM Inc.\n(6)Represents 53.4% of the limited partner or limited liability company interests in each Apollo Operating Group entity, held through the intermediate holding companies. AGM Inc. also indirectly owns 100% of the general partner or managing member interests in each Apollo Operating Group entity.\n(7)Represents 6.7% of the limited partner or limited liability company interests in each Apollo Operating Group entity held by Athene Holding Ltd. and/or its affiliates. AOG Units held by Athene are non-voting equity interests of the Apollo Operating Group and are not exchangeable for Class A shares.\nEach of the Apollo Operating Group entities holds interests in different businesses or entities organized in different jurisdictions.\nOur structure is designed to accomplish a number of objectives, the most important of which are as follows:\n\u2022Historically, we were a holding company that was qualified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our intermediate holding companies enabled us to maintain our partnership status and to meet the qualifying income exception. Effective September 5, 2019, Apollo Global Management, LLC converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation named Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\u2022We have historically used multiple management companies to segregate operations for business, financial and other reasons. Going forward, we may increase or decrease the number of our management companies, partnerships or other entities within the Apollo Operating Group based on our views regarding the appropriate balance between (a) administrative convenience and (b) continued business, financial, tax and other optimization.\nConversion to a C Corporation\nEffective September 5, 2019, Apollo Global Management, LLC converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation named Apollo Global Management, Inc. Prior to the Conversion, a portion of the investment income, performance allocations and principal investment income we earned was not subject to corporate-level tax in the United States. Subsequent to the Conversion, generally all of the income is subject to U.S. corporate income taxes, which could result in an overall higher income tax expense (or benefit) in periods subsequent to the Conversion.\nBusiness Environment\nAs a global investment manager, we are affected by numerous factors, including the condition of financial markets and the economy. Price fluctuations within equity, credit, commodity, foreign exchange markets, as well as interest rates, which may be volatile and mixed across geographies, can significantly impact the valuation of our funds' portfolio companies and related income we may recognize.\nIn the U.S., the S&P 500 Index increased by 16.3% in 2020, following an increase of 28.9% in 2019. Global equity markets also appreciated during the year, with the MSCI All Country World ex USA Index increasing 8.1% following an increase of 23.2% in 2019.\nConditions in the credit markets also have a significant impact on our business. Credit markets were positive in 2020, with the BofAML HY Master II Index increasing by 6.2%, while the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index increased by 2.8%. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield at the end of the year was 0.93%. The Federal Reserve lowered the benchmark interest rate two times during the year, for a target range of 0% to 0.25% at the end of 2020, down from to a target range of 1.50% to 1.75% at the end of 2019.\nForeign exchange rates can materially impact the valuations of our investments and those of our funds that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Relative to the U.S. dollar, the Euro appreciated 9.0% during the year, after depreciating by 2.2% in 2019, while the British pound appreciated 3.1% in 2020, after appreciating 3.9% in 2019. The price of crude oil depreciated by 20.5% during 2020, after appreciating by 34.5% during 2019.\nIn terms of economic conditions in the U.S., the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported real GDP decreased at an annual rate of 3.5% in 2020, following an increase of 2.1% in 2019. As of January 2021, the International Monetary Fund estimated that the U.S. economy will expand by 5.1% in 2021 and 2.5% in 2022. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. unemployment rate stood at 6.7% as of December 31, 2020.\nRegardless of the market or economic environment at any given time, Apollo relies on its contrarian, value-oriented approach to consistently invest capital on behalf of its fund investors by focusing on opportunities that management believes are often overlooked by other investors. As such, Apollo's global integrated investment platform deployed $88.2 billion of capital through the funds it manages during the year ended December 31, 2020. Drawdown capital deployed was $17.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe Apollo's expertise in credit and its focus on nine core industry sectors, combined with more than 30 years of investment experience, has allowed Apollo to respond quickly to changing environments.\nApollo's core industry sectors include chemicals, manufacturing and industrial, natural resources, consumer and retail, consumer services, business services, financial services, leisure, and media/telecom/technology. Apollo believes that these attributes have contributed to the success of its private equity funds investing in buyouts and credit opportunities during both expansionary and recessionary economic periods.\nIn general, institutional investors continue to allocate capital towards alternative investment managers for more attractive risk-adjusted returns in a low interest rate environment, and we believe the business environment remains generally accommodative to raise larger successor funds, launch new products, and pursue attractive strategic growth opportunities, such as continuing to grow the assets of our permanent capital vehicles. As such, Apollo had $122.7 billion of capital inflows during the year ended December 31, 2020. Apollo returned $8.7 billion of capital and realized gains to the investors in the funds it manages during the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively.\nOn October 20, 2020, at a regularly scheduled meeting of AGM Inc.'s board of directors, Apollo's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Leon Black, requested that the conflicts committee of the board of directors (comprised of independent directors) retain outside counsel to conduct a thorough review of, and independently confirm, the information that Mr. Black has conveyed about his previous professional relationship with Mr. Jeffrey Epstein. The conflicts committee had retained Dechert LLP as outside counsel to conduct a thorough, independent review which included interviewing individuals and examining relevant documents.\nOn January 25, 2021, the Company announced that the conflicts committee of the board of directors has completed its previously announced independent review of Chairman and CEO Leon Black's previous professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and publicly released the review's findings. The findings of the report are consistent with statements made by Mr. Black and Apollo regarding the prior relationship.\nOn January 25, 2021, the Company announced that, at a meeting of the executive committee of our board of directors on January 24, 2021, Mr. Black informed the executive committee members that he intends to retire from his position as Chief Executive Officer of the Company on or before July 31, 2021. Leon Black, Marc Rowan and Josh Harris, on behalf of our Class C Stockholder, voted to appoint Mr. Rowan as our Chief Executive Officer to begin serving in such role effective upon Mr. Black's retirement. Mr. Black will continue to serve as Chairman of our board of directors following his retirement from his position as Chief Executive Officer.\nManaging Business Performance\nWe believe that the presentation of Segment DE supplements a reader's understanding of the economic operating performance of each of our segments.\nSegment Distributable Earnings and Distributable Earnings\nSegment DE is the key performance measure used by management in evaluating the performance of Apollo's credit, private equity and real assets segments. See note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding the components of Segment DE. DE represents Segment DE less estimated current corporate, local and non-U.S. taxes as well as the current payable under Apollo's tax receivable agreement. DE is net of preferred dividends, if any, to the Series A and Series B preferred stockholders. DE excludes the impacts of the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities which arises from changes in estimated future tax rates. The economic assumptions and methodologies that impact the implied income tax provision are similar to those methodologies and certain assumptions used in calculating the income tax provision for Apollo's consolidated statements of operations under U.S. GAAP. Specifically, certain deductions considered in the income tax provision under U.S. GAAP, such as the deduction for transaction related charges and equity-based compensation, are taken into account for purposes of the implied tax provision. Management believes that excluding the remeasurement of the tax receivable agreement and deferred taxes from Segment DE and DE, respectively, is meaningful as it increases comparability between periods. Remeasurement of the tax receivable agreement and deferred taxes are estimates that may change due to changes in the interpretation of tax law.\nWe believe that Segment DE is helpful for an understanding of our business and that investors should review the same supplemental financial measure that management uses to analyze our segment performance. This measure supplements and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed below in -Overview of Results of Operations\u201d that have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding management's consideration of Segment DE.\nFee Related Earnings and Fee Related EBITDA\nFee Related Earnings, or FRE\u201d, is derived from our segment reported results and refers to a component of Segment DE that is used as a supplemental performance measure. See note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding the components of FRE.\nFee related EBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP measure derived from our segment reported results and is used to assess the performance of our operations as well as our ability to service current and future borrowings. Fee related EBITDA represents FRE plus amounts for depreciation and amortization. Fee related EBITDA +100% of net realized performance fees\u201d represents Fee related EBITDA plus realized performance fees less realized profit sharing expense.\nWe use Segment DE, DE, FRE and Fee related EBITDA as measures of operating performance, not as measures of liquidity. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other income data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The use of these measures without consideration of their related U.S. GAAP measures is not adequate due to the adjustments described above.\nOperating Metrics\nWe monitor certain operating metrics that are common to the alternative investment management industry. These operating metrics include Assets Under Management, capital deployed and uncalled commitments.\nAssets Under Management\nThe following presents Apollo's Total AUM and Fee-Generating AUM by segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 (in billions):\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Note: Totals may not add due to rounding </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following presents Apollo's AUM with Future Management Fee Potential for each of Apollo's three segments as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 (in billions):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Note: Totals may not add due to rounding </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents the components of Performance Fee-Eligible AUM for each of Apollo's three segments:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Credit </td> <td> </td> <td>Private Equity </td> <td> </td> <td>Real Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Credit </td> <td> </td> <td>Private Equity </td> <td> </td> <td>Real Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Fee-Generating AUM(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,886 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>68,867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,907 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,646 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AUM Not Currently Generating Performance Fees </td> <td>16,791 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,889 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,590 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Uninvested Performance Fee-Eligible AUM </td> <td>9,847 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,682 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Performance Fee-Eligible AUM (2)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>134,284 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,918 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Performance Fee-Generating AUM of $1.6 billion and $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, are above the hurdle rates or preferred returns and have been deferred to future periods when the fees are probable to not be significantly reversed.\n(2)Effective as of June 30, 2020, Performance Fee-Eligible AUM for Athora includes only capital commitments.

Outflows represent redemptions, other decreases in available capital and portfolio company depreciation. Realizations represent fund distributions of realized proceeds. Market activity represents gains (losses), the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other income.\n(2)For the year ended December 31, 2020, market activity includes mark-to-market changes and investment income of Athene, which had previously been reported as inflows. Prior period numbers have been recast to conform to the current presentation.\n(3)Outflows for Fee-Generating AUM include redemptions of $2.5 billion and $2.9 billion during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(4)Includes foreign exchange impacts of $5.7 billion, $19.6 million and $260.2 million for credit, private equity and real assets, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2020, and foreign exchange impacts of $(27.9) million, $3.7 million and $(27.2) million for credit, private equity and real assets, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020\nTotal Fee-Generating AUM was $348.7 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $102.2 billion or 41.5%, compared to $246.4 billion at December 31, 2019. The net increase was primarily due to net flows of $89.5 billion primarily related to:\n\u2022an $83.2 billion increase related to funds we manage in the credit segment primarily consisting of (i) an increase in AUM in the advisory and other category due to the growth of our insurance clients through a strategic acquisition, (ii) an increase in AUM as Athene closed its reinsurance transaction with Jackson National Life Insurance Company, which added $28 billion of AUM, and (iii) $3.5 billion of subscriptions across the corporate credit funds we manage; and\n\u2022a $7.5 billion increase related to funds we manage in the real assets segment primarily consisting of $5.9 billion of net segment transfers and $1.4 billion of fee-generating capital deployment, primarily related to the commencement of U.S. RE Fund III's investment period.\n\u2022Market activity of $15.8 billion primarily related to $15.0 billion of appreciation in the funds we manage in the credit segment, primarily related to the market activity of Athene and Athora.\nDeployment, Drawdown Deployment and Uncalled Commitments\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, the Company modified the definition of deployment to include net purchases, certain originations and net syndications to provide a more accurate representation of market activity across all the funds and accounts the Company manages. Prior period deployment figures have been recast to conform to this change in definition. The prior definition of deployment was limited to purchases in our commitment based funds, excluding certain funds in which permanent capital vehicles are the primary investor, and SIAs that have a defined maturity date, and has been renamed drawdown deployment\u201d.\nUncalled commitments, by contrast, represent unfunded capital commitments that certain of Apollo's funds and SIAs have received from fund investors to fund future or current fund investments and expenses.\nDeployment, drawdown deployment and uncalled commitments are indicative of the pace and magnitude of fund capital that is deployed or will be deployed, and which therefore could result in future revenues that include management fees, transaction fees and performance fees to the extent they are fee-generating. Deployment, drawdown deployment and uncalled commitments can also give rise to future costs that are related to the hiring of additional resources to manage and account for the additional capital that is deployed or will be deployed. Management uses deployment, drawdown deployment and uncalled commitments as key operating metrics since we believe the results are measures of our funds' investment activities.\nDeployment and Drawdown Deployment\nThe following presents deployment across all funds and drawdown deployment for funds and SIAs with a defined maturity date, by segment, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 (in billions):\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Note: Totals may not add due to rounding </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUncalled Commitments\nThe following presents Apollo's uncalled commitments by segment as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 (in billions):\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Note: Totals may not add due to rounding </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Apollo had $46.8 billion and $46.4 billion of dry powder, respectively, which represents the amount of capital available for investment or reinvestment subject to the provisions of the applicable limited partnership agreements or other governing agreements of the funds, partnerships and accounts we manage. These amounts exclude uncalled commitments which can only be called for fund fees and expenses and commitments from permanent capital vehicles.\nThe Historical Investment Performance of Our Funds\nBelow we present information relating to the historical performance of our funds, including certain legacy Apollo funds that do not have a meaningful amount of unrealized investments, and in respect of which the general partner interest has not been contributed to us.\nWhen considering the data presented below, you should note that the historical results of our funds are not indicative of the future results that you should expect from such funds, from any future funds we may raise or from your investment in our Class A shares.\nAn investment in our Class A shares is not an investment in any of the Apollo funds, and the assets and revenues of our funds are not directly available to us. The historical and potential future returns of the funds we manage are not directly linked to returns on our Class A shares. Therefore, you should not conclude that continued positive performance of the funds we manage will necessarily result in positive returns on an investment in our Class A shares. However, poor performance of the funds that we manage would cause a decline in our revenue from such funds, and would therefore have a negative effect on our performance and in all likelihood the value of our Class A shares.\nMoreover, the historical returns of our funds should not be considered indicative of the future results you should expect from such funds or from any future funds we may raise. There can be no assurance that any Apollo fund will continue to achieve the same results in the future.\nFinally, our private equity IRRs have historically varied greatly from fund to fund. For example, Fund VI generated a 12% gross IRR and a 9% net IRR since its inception through December 31, 2020, while Fund V generated a 61% gross IRR\nand a 44% net IRR since its inception through December 31, 2020. Accordingly, the IRR going forward for any current or future fund may vary considerably from the historical IRR generated by any particular fund, or for our private equity funds as a whole. Future returns will also be affected by the applicable risks, including risks of the industries and businesses in which a particular fund invests. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Businesses-The historical returns attributable to our funds should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results or of any returns expected on an investment in our Class A shares and our Preferred shares\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors-The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. and global economy and is expected to continue to impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d\nInvestment Record\nThe following table summarizes the investment record by segment of Apollo's significant commitment-based funds that have a defined maturity date in which investors make a commitment to provide capital at the formation of such funds and deliver capital when called as investment opportunities become available. The funds included in the investment record table below have greater than $500 million of AUM and/or form part of a flagship series of funds.\nAll amounts are as of December 31, 2020, unless otherwise

Other Credit is defined as investments in debt securities of issuers other than portfolio companies that are not considered to be distressed.\nDuring the recovery and expansionary periods of 1994 through 2000 and late 2003 through the first half of 2007, our private equity funds invested or committed to invest approximately $13.7 billion primarily in traditional and corporate partner buyouts. During the recessionary periods of 1990 through 1993, 2001 through late 2003 and the recessionary and post recessionary periods (beginning the second half of 2007 through December 31, 2020), our private equity funds have invested $60.1 billion, of which $21.2 billion was in distressed buyouts and debt investments when the debt securities of quality companies traded at deep discounts to par value. Our average entry multiple for Fund VIII, VII and VI was 5.7x, 6.1x and 7.7x, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. Our average entry multiple for a private equity fund is the average of the total enterprise value over an applicable adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which may incorporate certain adjustments based on the investment team's estimates and we believe captures the true economics of our funds' investments in portfolio companies. The average entry multiple of actively investing funds may include committed investments not yet closed.\nPermanent Capital\nThe following table summarizes the investment record for our permanent capital vehicles by segment, excluding Athene-related and Athora-related assets managed or advised by ISG and ISGI:\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Returns(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>IPO Year(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total AUM </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MidCap(3)\n</td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AIF </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td>345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AFT </td> <td>2011 </td> <td> </td> <td>373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AINV/Other(4)\n</td> <td>2004 </td> <td> </td> <td>4,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Assets: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ARI </td> <td>2009 </td> <td> </td> <td>6,930 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Total returns are based on the change in closing trading prices during the respective periods presented taking into account dividends and distributions, if any, as if they were reinvested without regard to commission.\n(2)An initial public offering ( IPO\u201d) year represents the year in which the vehicle commenced trading on a national securities exchange.\n(3)MidCap is not a publicly traded vehicle and therefore IPO year is not applicable. The returns presented are a gross return based on NAV. The net returns based on NAV were 1% and 11% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\n(4)Included within Total AUM of AINV/Other is $1.6 billion of AUM related to a non-traded business development company from which Apollo earns investment-related service fees, but for which Apollo does not provide management or advisory services. Total returns exclude performance related to this AUM.\nSIAs\nAs of December 31, 2020, Apollo managed approximately $30 billion of total AUM in SIAs, which include capital deployed from certain SIAs across Apollo's credit, private equity and real assets funds.\nOverview of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nAdvisory and Transaction Fees, Net. As a result of providing advisory services with respect to actual and potential credit, private equity, and real assets investments, we are entitled to receive fees for transactions related to the acquisition and, in certain instances, disposition of portfolio companies as well as fees for ongoing monitoring of portfolio company operations and directors' fees. We also receive advisory fees for advisory services provided to certain credit funds. In addition, monitoring fees are generated on certain structured portfolio company investments. Under the terms of the limited partnership agreements for certain funds, the management fee payable by the funds may be subject to a reduction based on a certain percentage of such advisory and transaction fees, net of applicable broken deal costs ( Management Fee Offset\u201d). Such amounts are presented as a reduction to advisory and transaction fees, net, in the consolidated statements of operations (see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for more detail on advisory and transaction fees, net).\nThe Management Fee Offsets are calculated for each fund as follows:\n\u202265%-100% for certain credit funds, gross advisory, transaction and other special fees;\n\u202265%-100% for private equity funds, gross advisory, transaction and other special fees; and\n\u202265%-100% for certain real assets funds, gross advisory, transaction and other special fees.\nManagement Fees. The significant growth of the assets we manage has had a positive effect on our revenues. Management fees are typically calculated based upon any of net asset value,\u201d gross assets,\u201d adjusted par asset value,\u201d adjusted costs of all unrealized portfolio investments,\u201d capital commitments,\u201d invested capital,\u201d adjusted assets,\u201d capital contributions,\u201d or stockholders' equity,\u201d each as defined in the applicable limited partnership agreement and/or management agreement of the unconsolidated funds.\nPerformance Fees. The general partners of our funds are entitled to an incentive return of normally up to 20% of the total returns of a fund's capital, depending upon performance of the underlying funds and subject to preferred returns and high water marks, as applicable. Performance fees, categorized as performance allocations, are accounted for as an equity method investment, and effectively, the performance fees for any period are based upon an assumed liquidation of the funds' assets at the reporting date, and distribution of the net proceeds in accordance with the funds' allocation provisions. Performance fees categorized as incentive fees, which are not accounted as an equity method investment, are deferred until fees are probable to not be significantly reversed. Prior to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, incentive fees were recognized on an assumed liquidation basis. The majority of performance fees are comprised of performance allocations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 57% of the value of our funds' investments on a gross basis was determined using market-based valuation methods (i.e., reliance on broker or listed exchange quotes) and the remaining 43% was determined primarily by comparable company and industry multiples or discounted cash flow models. For our credit, private equity and real assets segments, the percentage determined using market-based valuation methods as of December 31, 2020 was 74%, 21% and 22%, respectively. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Businesses-Our funds' performance, and our performance, may be adversely affected by the financial performance of our funds' portfolio companies and the industries in which our funds invest\u201d and -The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. and global economy and is expected to continue to impact our business, financial condition and results of operations\u201d for discussion regarding certain industry-specific risks that could affect the fair value of our private equity funds' portfolio company investments.\nIn our private equity funds, the Company does not earn performance fees until the investors in the fund have achieved cumulative investment returns on invested capital (including management fees and expenses) in excess of an 8% hurdle rate. Additionally, certain of our credit and real assets funds have various performance fee rates and hurdle rates. Certain of our credit and real assets funds allocate performance fees to the general partner in a similar manner as the private equity funds. In our private equity, certain credit and real assets funds, so long as the investors achieve their priority returns, there is a catch-up formula whereby the Company earns a priority return for a portion of the return until the Company's performance fees equate to its incentive fee rate for that fund; thereafter, the Company participates in returns from the fund at the performance fee rate. Performance fees, categorized as performance allocations, are subject to reversal to the extent that the performance fees distributed exceed the amount due to the general partner based on a fund's cumulative investment returns. The Company recognizes potential repayment of previously received performance fees as a general partner obligation representing all amounts previously distributed to the general partner that would need to be repaid to the Apollo funds if these funds were to be liquidated based on the current fair value of the underlying funds' investments as of the reporting date. The actual general\npartner obligation, however, would not become payable or realized until the end of a fund's life or as otherwise set forth in the respective limited partnership agreement of the fund.\nThe table below presents an analysis of Apollo's (i) performance fees receivable on an unconsolidated basis and (ii) realized and unrealized performance fees for Apollo's combined segments:\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

real asset funds had $215.0 million and $46.9 million, respectively, in general partner obligations to return previously distributed performance fees. The fair value gain on investments and income at the fund level needed to reverse the general partner obligations for certain private equity funds and certain real assets funds was $2,114.7 million and $43.5 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.\n(2)As of December 31, 2020, the remaining investments and escrow cash of Fund VII, Fund VI, ANRP I and ANRP II were valued at 52%, 34%, 22% and 83% of the fund's unreturned capital, respectively, which were below the required escrow ratio of 115%. As a result, these funds are required to place in escrow current and future performance fee distributions to the general partner until the specified return ratio of 115% is met (at the time of a future distribution) or upon liquidation. As of December 31, 2020, Fund VII had $128.5 million of gross performance fees, or $73.2 million net of profit sharing, in escrow.

As of December 31, 2020, ANRP II had $31.2 million of gross performance fees, or $18.7 million net of profit sharing, in escrow. With respect to Fund VII, Fund VI, ANRP II and ANRP I, realized performance fees currently distributed to the general partner are limited to potential tax distributions and interest on escrow balances per these funds' partnership agreements. Performance fees receivable as of December 31, 2020 and realized performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 include interest earned on escrow balances that is not subject to contingent repayment.\n(3)Other includes certain SIAs.\n(4)There was a corresponding profit sharing payable of $826.8 million as of December 31, 2020, including profit sharing payable related to amounts in escrow and contingent consideration obligations of $119.8 million.\nThe general partners of certain of our credit funds accrue performance fees, categorized as performance allocations, when the fair value of investments exceeds the cost basis of the individual investors' investments in the fund, including any allocable share of expenses incurred in connection with such investments, which we refer to as high water marks.\u201d These high water marks are applied on an individual investor basis. Certain of our credit funds have investors with various high water marks, the achievement of which is subject to market conditions and investment performance.\nPerformance fees from our private equity funds and certain credit and real assets funds are subject to contingent repayment by the general partner in the event of future losses to the extent that the cumulative performance fees distributed from inception to date exceeds the amount computed as due to the general partner at the final distribution. These general partner obligations, if applicable, are included in due to related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nThe following table summarizes our performance fees

denominated in Euros and historical figures are translated into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of \u20ac1.00 to $1.22 as of December 31, 2020. Certain funds are denominated in pound sterling and translated into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of \u00a31.00 to $1.37 as of December 31, 2020.\n(2)Amounts in Distributed by Fund and Recognized\u201d for the Citi Property Investors ( CPI\u201d), Gulf Stream Asset Management, LLC ( Gulf Stream\u201d), Stone Tower Capital LLC and its related companies ( Stone Tower\u201d) funds and SIAs are presented for activity subsequent to the respective acquisition dates. Amounts exclude certain performance fees from business development companies and Redding Ridge Holdings LP ( Redding Ridge Holdings\u201d), an affiliate of Redding Ridge.\n(3)Amounts were computed based on the fair value of fund investments on December 31, 2020. Performance fees have been allocated to and recognized by the general partner. Based on the amount allocated, a portion is subject to potential reversal or, to the extent applicable, has been reduced by the general partner obligation to return previously distributed performance fees at December 31, 2020. The actual determination and any required payment of any such general partner obligation would not take place until the final disposition of the fund's investments based on contractual termination of the fund.\n(4)Represents the amount of performance fees that would be reversed if remaining fund investments became worthless on December 31, 2020. Amounts subject to potential reversal of performance fees include amounts undistributed by a fund (i.e., the performance fees receivable), as well as a portion of the amounts that have been distributed by a fund, net of taxes and not subject to a general partner obligation to return previously distributed performance fees, except for those funds that are gross of taxes as defined in the respective funds' governing documents.\n(5)Other includes certain SIAs.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits. Our most significant expense is compensation and benefits expense. This consists of fixed salary, discretionary and non-discretionary bonuses, profit sharing expense associated with the performance fees earned from credit, private equity, and real assets funds and compensation expense associated with the vesting of non-cash equity-based awards.\nOur compensation arrangements with certain partners and employees contain a significant performance-based incentive component. Therefore, as our net revenues increase, our compensation costs rise. Our compensation costs also reflect the increased investment in people as we expand geographically and create new funds.\nIn addition, certain professionals and selected other individuals have a profit sharing interest in the performance fees earned in relation to our private equity, certain credit and real assets funds in order to better align their interests with our own and with those of the investors in these funds. Profit sharing expense is part of our compensation and benefits expense and is generally based upon a fixed percentage of credit, private equity and real assets performance fees. Profit sharing expense can reverse during periods when there is a decline in performance fees that were previously recognized. Profit sharing amounts are normally distributed to employees after the corresponding investment gains have been realized and generally before preferred returns are achieved for the investors. Therefore, changes in our unrealized performance fees have the same effect on our profit sharing expense. Profit sharing expense increases when unrealized performance fees increases. Realizations only impact profit sharing expense to the extent that the effects on investments have not been recognized previously. If losses on other investments within a fund are subsequently realized, the profit sharing amounts previously distributed are normally subject to a general partner obligation to return performance fees previously distributed back to the funds. This general partner obligation due to the funds would be realized only when the fund is liquidated, which generally occurs at the end of the fund's term. However, indemnification obligations also exist for realized gains with respect to Fund IV, Fund V and Fund VI, which, although our Managing Partners and Contributing Partners would remain personally liable, may indemnify our Managing Partners and Contributing Partners for 17.5% to 100% of the previously distributed profits regardless of the fund's future performance. See note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company's indemnification liability.\nEach Managing Partner receives $100,000 per year in base salary for services rendered to us. Additionally, our Managing Partners can receive other forms of compensation. In addition, AHL Awards and other equity-based compensation awards have been granted to the Company and certain employees, which amortize over the respective vesting periods. The Company grants equity awards to certain employees, including RSUs, restricted Class A shares and options, that generally vest and become exercisable in quarterly installments or annual installments depending on the contract terms over a period of three to six years. In some instances, vesting of an RSU is also subject to the Company's receipt of performance fees, within prescribed periods, sufficient to cover the associated equity-based compensation expense. See note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of equity-based compensation.\nOther Expenses. The balance of our other expenses includes interest, placement fees, and general, administrative and other operating expenses. Interest expense consists primarily of interest related to the 2024 Senior Notes, the 2026 Senior Notes, the 2029 Senior Notes, the 2030 Senior Notes, the 2039 Senior Secured Guaranteed Notes, the 2048 Senior Notes and the 2050 Subordinated Notes as discussed in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. Placement fees are incurred in connection with our capital raising activities. In cases where the limited partners of the funds are determined to be the customer in an arrangement, placement fees may be capitalized as a cost to acquire a customer contract, and amortized over the life of the customer contract. General, administrative and other expenses includes occupancy expense, depreciation and amortization, professional fees and costs related to travel, information technology and administration. Occupancy expense represents charges related to office leases and associated expenses, such as utilities and maintenance fees. Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets is normally calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, ranging from two to sixteen years, taking into consideration any residual value. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the expected term of the lease. Intangible assets are amortized based on the future cash flows over the expected useful lives of the assets.\nOther Income (Loss)\nNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities. Net gains (losses) from investment activities include both realized gains and losses and the change in unrealized gains and losses in our investment portfolio between the opening reporting date and the closing reporting date. Net unrealized gains (losses) are a result of changes in the fair value of unrealized investments and reversal of unrealized gains (losses) due to dispositions of investments during the reporting period. Significant judgment and estimation goes into the assumptions that drive these models and the actual values realized with respect to investments could be materially different from values obtained based on the use of those models. The valuation methodologies applied impact the reported value of investment company holdings and their underlying portfolios in our consolidated financial statements.\nNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities of Consolidated Variable Interest Entities. Changes in the fair value of the consolidated VIEs' assets and liabilities and related interest, dividend and other income and expenses subsequent to consolidation are presented within net gains (losses) from investment activities of consolidated variable interest entities and are attributable to Non-Controlling Interests in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOther Income (Losses), Net. Other income (losses), net includes gains (losses) arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, remeasurement of the tax receivable agreement liability and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses.\nIncome Taxes. Prior to the Conversion, certain entities in the Apollo Operating Group operated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, these members of the Apollo Operating Group were not subject to U.S. federal income taxes. However, certain of these entities were subject to New York City unincorporated business taxes ( NYC UBT\u201d) and certain non-U.S. entities were subject to non-U.S. corporate income taxes. Effective September 5, 2019, Apollo Global Management, LLC converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation named Apollo Global Management, Inc. Subsequent to the Conversion, generally all of the income is subject to U.S. corporate income taxes, which could result in an overall higher income tax expense (or benefit) in periods subsequent to the Conversion.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and in evaluating income tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We recognize the income tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only where the position is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits of the positions. The tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained, then no benefits of the position are recognized. The Company's income tax positions are reviewed and evaluated quarterly to determine whether or not we have uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition or de-recognition.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences, using currently enacted tax rates, of differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nNon-Controlling Interests\nFor entities that are consolidated, but not 100% owned, a portion of the income or loss and corresponding equity is allocated to owners other than Apollo. The aggregate of the income or loss and corresponding equity that is not owned by the Company is included in Non-Controlling Interests in the consolidated financial statements. The Non-Controlling Interests relating to Apollo Global Management, Inc. primarily include the 40.4% and 44.7% ownership interest in the Apollo Operating Group held by the Managing Partners and Contributing Partners through their limited partner interests in Holdings as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, Athene holds a 6.7% Non-Controlling Interest in the Apollo Operating Group as a result of the Transaction Agreement. Non-Controlling Interests also include limited partner interests in certain consolidated funds and VIEs.\nThe authoritative guidance for Non-Controlling Interests in the consolidated financial statements requires reporting entities to present Non-Controlling Interest as equity and provides guidance on the accounting for transactions between an entity and Non-Controlling Interests. According to the guidance, (1) Non-Controlling Interests are presented as a separate component of stockholders' equity on the Company's consolidated statements of financial condition, (2) net income (loss) includes the net income (loss) attributable to the Non-Controlling Interest holders on the Company's consolidated statements of operations, (3) the primary components of Non-Controlling Interest are separately presented in the Company's consolidated\nstatements of changes in stockholders' equity to clearly distinguish the interests in the Apollo Operating Group and other ownership interests in the consolidated entities and (4) profits and losses are allocated to Non-Controlling Interests in proportion to their ownership interests regardless of their basis.\nResults of Operations\nBelow is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

While we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our results from operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures, our\ncompliance with these measures has impacted our day-to-day operations and could disrupt our business and operations, as well as that of the Apollo Funds and their portfolio companies, for an indefinite period of time. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Businesses - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. and global economy and is expected to continue to impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nIn this section, references to 2020 refer to the year ended December 31, 2020 and references to 2019 refer to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nRevenues\nManagement fees increased by $111.2 million to $1.7 billion in 2020 from $1.6 billion in 2019. This change was primarily attributable to an increase in management fees earned from Athene and Athora of $87.9 million and $65.0 million, respectively. For additional details regarding changes in management fees in each segment, see -Segment Analysis\u201d below.\nAdvisory and transaction fees, net, increased by $125.8 million to $249.5 million in 2020 from $123.6 million in 2019. This increase was primarily driven by advisory and transaction fees earned in relation to a long-term strategic investment for an underlying real estate portfolio, transaction and advisory fees earned related to a strategic investment in a leading U.S. metal container business as well as net advisory and transaction fees earned with respect to certain portfolio companies in the media, telecom and technology industries and an increase in structuring fees earned from a company in the consumer and retail industry.\nPerformance allocations decreased by $746.7 million to $310.5 million in 2020 from $1.1 billion in 2019. The decrease in performance allocations was primarily attributable to decreased performance allocations earned from Fund VIII and SCRF IV of $622.4 million and $121.3 million, respectively, during 2020.\nThe decrease in performance allocations from Fund VIII was primarily driven by a lower appreciation in the value of the fund's investments in public portfolio companies primarily in the manufacturing and industrial, consumer services, and financial sectors and in private portfolio companies primarily in the consumer services and leisure sectors during 2020. The decrease in performance allocations from SCRF IV was primarily driven by the fund's mark-to-market losses on its investments in structured credit products due to widespread market sell-off and spread widening during 2020.\nPrincipal investment income decreased by $84.8 million to $81.7 million in 2020 from $166.5 million in 2019. This change was primarily driven by decreases in the value of investments held by certain Apollo funds and other entities in which the Company has a direct interest, mainly with respect to Fund VIII and AION of $70.3 million and $14.8 million, respectively.\nIncentive fees increased by $16.7 million to $25.4 million in 2020 from $8.7 million in 2019. This change was primarily attributable to an increase in incentive fees earned from a strategic investment account of $13.9 million in 2020.\nExpenses\nCompensation and benefits decreased by $172.4 million to $1.1 billion in 2020 from $1.3 billion in 2019. This change was primarily attributable to a decrease in profit sharing expense of $309.4 million due to a corresponding decrease in performance allocations during 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. In any period the blended profit sharing percentage is impacted by the respective profit sharing ratios of the funds generating performance allocations in the period. The decrease in profit sharing expense was partially offset by an increase in salary, bonus and benefits of $113.5 million, primarily attributable to an increase in headcount. Additionally, there was an increase in equity-based compensation of $23.5 million due to higher amortization expenses associated with previously granted performance awards.\nIncluded in profit sharing expense is $72.1 million and $72.2 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to the Incentive Pool. See -Profit Sharing Expense\u201d in the Critical Accounting Policies section for an overview of the Incentive Pool.\nInterest expense increased by $34.9 million to $133.2 million in 2020 from $98.4 million in 2019, primarily due to additional interest expense incurred as a result of the timing of issuances of debt arrangements, as described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.\nGeneral, administrative and other expenses increased by $23.9 million to $354.2 million in 2020 from $330.3 million in 2019. This change was primarily driven by an increase in professional fees and technology expenses during 2020.\nOther Income (Loss)\nNet losses from investment activities were $455.5 million in 2020 as compared to net gains from investment activities of $138.2 million in 2019. This change was primarily attributable to unrealized mark-to-market losses from the company's investment in Athene Holding related to the combined impact of COVID-19 related market dislocation and a discount for lack of marketability ( DLOM\u201d) during 2020. See note 7 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company's investment in Athene Holding.\nNet gains from investment activities of consolidated VIEs increased by $157.5 million to $197.4 million in 2020 from $39.9 million in 2019. This change was primarily driven by gains from newly consolidated funds during 2020, as discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.\nInterest income decreased by $20.5 million to $15.0 million in 2020 from $35.5 million in 2019, primarily due to decreased interest income earned from U.S. Treasury securities as a result of lower interest rates in 2020.\nOther Income, net was $20.8 million in 2020, as compared to other loss of $46.3 million in 2019. There was a gain in 2020 as compared to a loss in 2019 which was primarily attributable to losses from the change in tax receivable agreement liability.\nIncome Tax Provision\nIn 2020, the Company recognized an income tax provision of $(87.0) million, while in 2019, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of $129.0 million. The change was primarily related to: (i) the significant benefit retained by the Company upon Conversion in 2019 for the step-up in assets from prior year exchanges of AOG Units for Class A shares, and (ii) all earnings becoming subject to corporate-level taxation subsequent to Conversion. The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign income taxes resulting in an effective income tax rate of 15.7% and (9.2)% for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The most significant reconciling items between our U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and our effective income tax rate were due to the following: (i) income passed through to Non-Controlling Interests, (ii) foreign, state and local income taxes, including NYC UBT, and (iii) impacts upon Conversion in 2019 noted above (see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the Company's income tax provision).\nSegment Analysis\nDiscussed below are our results of operations for each of our reportable segments. They represent the segment information available and utilized by our executive management, which consists of our Managing Partners, who operate collectively as our chief operating decision maker, to assess performance and to allocate resources. See note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our segment reporting.\nOur financial results vary, since performance fees, which generally constitute a large portion of the income from the funds that we manage, as well as the transaction and advisory fees that we receive, can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. As a result, we emphasize long-term financial growth and profitability to manage our business.\nA discussion of our segment statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 is included in the Company's 2019 Annual Report.\nCredit\nThe following table sets forth our segment statement of operations information and our supplemental

This change was primarily attributable to an increase in management fees earned from Athene and Athora of $81.4 million and $49.1 million, respectively.\nAdvisory and transaction fees, net increased by $73.4 million to $117.5 million in 2020 from $44.1 million in 2019. This increase was primarily driven by advisory and transaction fees earned in relation to a long-term strategic investment for an underlying real estate portfolio, transaction and advisory fees earned related to a strategic investment in a U.S. metal container business, and structuring fees earned related to portfolio companies in the energy and consumer and retail industries during 2020.\nPerformance fees decreased by $11.3 million to $9.8 million in 2020 from $21.1 million in 2019, primarily attributable to a decrease in performance fees earned from Redding Ridge Holdings of $9.1 million, as Redding Ridge Holdings achieved its annualized hurdle rate during 2019 but did not do so in 2020.\nSalary, bonus and benefits expense increased by $50.4 million to $246.5 million in 2020 from $196.1 million in 2019 primarily due to an increase in headcount.\nGeneral, administrative and other expense increased by $24.4 million to $156.1 million in 2020 from $131.7 million in 2019. The change was primarily driven by increases in professional fees and technology expense in 2020.\nRealized performance fees increased by $18.8 million to $188.4 million in 2020 from $169.6 million in 2019. This change was primarily attributable to an increase in realized performance fees generated from Credit Strategies and PPF Credit Strategies of $68.2 million and $18.9 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in realized performance fees generated from Midcap and FCI I of $45.4 million and $24.2 million, respectively in 2020.\nThe increase in realized performance fees from Credit Strategies and PPF Credit Strategies were a result of additional fees that crystallized on December 31, 2020, as market values were higher for investments held across the funds during December 31, 2020. The decrease in realized performance fees generated from Midcap was primarily a result of achieving a vesting provision during 2019, while the fund had no realized performance fees in 2020. The decrease in realized performance fees generated from FCI I was primarily driven by realizations of the fund's investments in various life settlement policies during 2019, while the fund had no realized performance fees during 2020.\nRealized profit sharing expense increased by $35.2 million to $128.8 million in 2020 from $93.7 million in 2019, as a result of a corresponding increase in realized performance fees as described above, and an increase in profit sharing expense related to the Incentive Pool. In any period the blended profit sharing percentage is impacted by the respective profit sharing ratios of the funds generating performance fees in the period. Included in realized profit sharing expense is $49.2 million and $17.7 million related to the Incentive Pool for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Incentive Pool is separate from the fund related profit sharing expense and may result in greater variability in compensation and have a variable impact on the blended profit sharing percentage during a particular period.\nNet interest loss and other increased by $34.2 million to $56.2 million in 2020 from $22.0 million in 2019, primarily due to additional interest expense incurred as a result of the timing of issuances of debt arrangements, as described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements as well as a decrease in interest income earned from U.S. Treasury securities as a result of lower interest rates in 2020.. Additionally, the increase was partially due to one-time costs to wind down a managed account arrangement incurred during 2020.\nPrivate Equity\nThe following table sets forth our segment statement of

to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nIn this section, references to 2020 refer to the year ended December 31, 2020 and references to 2019 refer to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nManagement fees decreased by $16.7 million to $506.5 million in 2020 from $523.2 million in 2019. This change was primarily attributable to a decrease in management fees earned from Fund VIII, Fund VII and COF III of $14.1 million, $11.0 million and $6.4 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase in management fees earned from HVF I of $12.8 million.\nAdvisory and transaction fees, net increased by $53.4 million to $124.7 million in 2020 from $71.3 million in 2019. This change was primarily attributable to transaction fees earned with respect to portfolio companies in the media, telecom and technology industries, a structuring fee earned from a portfolio company in the consumer and retail industries and transaction fees earned with respect to portfolio companies in the leisure industry.\nSalary, bonus and benefits expense increased by $19.8 million to $204.2 million in 2020 from $184.4 million in 2019 primarily due to an increase in headcount.\nRealized performance fees decreased by $399.5 million to $29.7 million in 2020 from $429.2 million in 2019. This change was primarily attributable to a decrease in realized performance fees generated from Fund VIII of $400.7 million. The realized performance fees earned from Fund VIII in 2019 were the result of sales and income generated from investments primarily in the manufacturing and industrial, business services, financial services and consumer service sectors. Fund VIII had no realized performance fees during 2020.\nRealized profit sharing expense decreased by $175.5 million to $19.7 million in 2020 from $195.1 million in 2019, as a result of the corresponding decrease in realized performance fees as described above as well as a decrease in the profit sharing expense related to the Incentive Pool. In any period the blended profit sharing percentage is impacted by the respective profit sharing ratios of the funds generating performance fees in the period. Included in realized profit sharing expense is $7.4 million and $54.4 million of expenses related to the Incentive Pool for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Incentive Pool is separate from the fund related profit sharing expense and may result in greater variability in compensation and have a variable impact on the blended profit sharing percentage during a particular period.\nRealized principal investment income decreased by $45.0 million to $8.7 million in 2020 from $53.8 million in 2019. This change was primarily attributable to a decrease in realizations from Apollo's equity ownership in Fund VIII of $48.2 million in 2020.\nNet interest loss and other increased by $23.4 million to $55.2 million in 2020 from $31.8 million in 2019 primarily due to additional interest expense incurred as a result of the timing of issuances of debt arrangements, as described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements as well as a decrease in interest income earned from U.S. Treasury securities as a result of lower interest rates in 2020. Additionally, the increase was partially due to one-time costs to wind down a managed account arrangement incurred during 2020.\nReal Assets\nThe following table sets forth our segment statement of

to the year ended December 31, 2020 and references to 2019 refer to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nManagement fees increased by $18.0 million to $206.6 million in 2020 from $188.6 million in 2019. This change was primarily attributable to an increase in management fees earned from Athene, Athora and Apollo Infrastructure Opportunity Fund II ( AIOF II\u201d) of $7.7 million, $5.0 million and $4.2 million, respectively.\nAdvisory and transaction fees, net increased by $1.8 million to $9.3 million in 2020 from $7.5 million in 2019. This change was primarily attributable to advisory and transaction fees earned with respect to a portfolio company in the consumer and retail industry.\nSalary, bonus and benefits expense increased by $27.5 million to $110.3 million in 2020 from $82.8 million in 2019 primarily due to an increase in headcount.\nGeneral, administrative and other expense increased by $9.1 million to $51.4 million in 2020 from $42.2 million in 2019. The change was primarily driven by an increase in fund organizational expenses, technology expense and professional fees in 2020.\nRealized performance fees increased by $59.5 million to $62.8 million in 2020 from $3.3 million in 2019. The increase in realized performance fees in 2020 was primarily attributable to realized performance fees generated from EPF III and Apollo Infrastructure Opportunity Fund I ( AIOF I\u201d) of $34.1 million and $15.4 million, respectively.\nThe increase in realized performance fees from EPF III was a result of the sale of investments in logistics assets in 2020, while the fund had no realized performance fees during 2019. The increase in realized performance fees from AIOF I was primarily a result of realizations of infrastructure related assets.\nRealized profit sharing expense increased by $40.4 million to $41.8 million in 2020 from $1.4 million in 2019 as a result of the corresponding increase in realized performance fees as described above, and an increase in profit sharing expense related to the Incentive Pool. In any period the blended profit sharing percentage is impacted by the respective profit sharing ratios of the funds generating performance fees in the period. Included in realized profit sharing expense is $15.5 million and $0.1 million related to the Incentive Pool for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Incentive Pool is separate from the fund related profit sharing expense and may result in greater variability in compensation and have a variable impact on the blended profit sharing percentage during a particular period.\nRealized principal investment income increased by $2.6 million to $5.7 million in 2020 from $3.2 million in 2019. This change was primarily attributable to an increase in realizations from Apollo's equity ownership in AIOF I and EPF III.\nNet interest loss and other increased by $11.6 million to $23.1 million in 2020 from $11.5 million in 2019 primarily due to additional interest expense incurred as a result of the timing of issuances of debt arrangements, as described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements as well as a decrease in interest income earned from U.S. Treasury securities as a result of lower interest rates in 2020.\nSummary of Distributable Earnings\nThe following table is a reconciliation of Distributable Earnings per share of common and equivalent to net dividend per share of common and equivalent.\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except per share data) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Distributable Earnings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,019,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,214,427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>953,479 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxes and related payables </td> <td>(89,989) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(62,300) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(44,215) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred dividends </td> <td>(36,656) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36,656) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,662) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributable Earnings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>892,835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,115,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>877,602 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back: Tax and related payables attributable to common and equivalents </td> <td>63,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,814 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,645 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributable Earnings before certain payables(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>956,395 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,165,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>914,247 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Percent to common and equivalents </td> <td>54 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributable Earnings before other payables attributable to common and equivalents </td> <td>516,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>652,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>466,266 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Taxes and related payables attributable to common and equivalents </td> <td>(63,560) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49,814) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36,645) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributable Earnings attributable to common and equivalents(2)\n</td> <td>452,893 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>602,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>429,621 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributable Earnings per share(3)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.02 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.70 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retained capital per share(3)\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.35) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.29) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net dividend per share(3)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.02 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.83 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Distributable Earnings before certain payables represents Distributable Earnings before the deduction for the estimated current corporate taxes and the amounts payable under Apollo's tax receivable agreement.\n(2) Common and equivalents\u201d consists of total Class A shares outstanding and RSUs that participate in dividends.\n(3)Per share calculations are based on end of period Distributable Earnings Shares Outstanding, which consists of total Class A shares outstanding, AOG Units that participate in dividends and RSUs that participate in dividends.\nSummary of Non-U.S. GAAP Measures\nThe table below sets forth a reconciliation of net income attributable to Apollo Global Management, Inc.

Apollo targets operating expense levels such that fee income exceeds total operating expenses each period. The company intends to distribute to its stockholders on a quarterly basis substantially all of its distributable earnings after taxes and related payables in excess of amounts determined to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of the business. As a result, the Company requires limited capital resources to support the working capital or operating needs of the business. While primarily met by cash flows generated through fee income received, liquidity needs are also met (to a limited extent) through proceeds from borrowings and equity issuances as described in notes 11 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, respectively. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.6 billion at December 31, 2020.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been volatility in the financial markets. While the Company is not aware of any events that would result in an immediate impact to our liquidity needs, we continue to monitor developments on the global spread of COVID-19 as additional information is obtained.\nPrimary Sources and Uses of Cash\nThe Company has multiple sources of short-term liquidity to meet its capital needs, including cash on hand, annual cash flows from its activities, and available funds from the Company's $750 million revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2020. The Company believes these sources will be sufficient to fund our capital needs for at least the next twelve months. If the Company determines that market conditions are favorable after taking into account our liquidity requirements, we may seek to issue additional senior notes, preferred equity, or other financing instruments.\nThe section below discusses in more detail the Company's primary sources and uses of cash and the primary drivers of cash flows within the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,616,430) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,082,694 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>814,259 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing Activities </td> <td>(837,659) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(263,972) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(247,260) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing Activities </td> <td>3,299,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>139,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(752,184) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Cash Held at Consolidated Variable Interest Entities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>845,221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>958,435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(185,185) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe assets of our consolidated funds and VIEs, on a gross basis, can be substantially larger than the assets of our core business and, accordingly, could have substantial effect on the accompanying statement of cash flows. Because our consolidated funds and VIEs are treated as investment companies for accounting purposes, their investing cash flow amounts are included in our cash flows from operations.

Net cash provided by financing activities also reflects the financing activity of our consolidated funds and VIEs, which primarily include cash inflows from the issuance of debt offset by cash outflows for the principal repayment of debt.\n\u2022During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in financing activities primarily reflects repayments on the Term Facility and distributions to Class A shareholders and Non-Controlling interest holders, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of the Series B Preferred shares and the 2048 Senior Notes.\nFuture Debt Obligations\nThe Company had long-term debt of $3.2 billion at December 31, 2020, which includes $3.1 billion of notes with maturities in 2024, 2026, 2029, 2030, 2039, 2048 and 2050. See note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company's debt arrangements.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company had unfunded general partner commitments of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2020, of which $348.0 million related to Fund IX. For a summary and a description of the nature of the Company's commitments, contingencies and contractual obligations, see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements and -Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d. The Company's commitments are primarily fulfilled through cash flows from operations and (to a limited extent) through borrowings and equity issuances as described in notes 11 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, respectively.\nConsolidated Funds and VIEs\nThe Company manages its liquidity needs by evaluating unconsolidated cash flows; however, the Company's financial statements reflect the financial position of Apollo as well as Apollo's consolidated funds (including SPACs) and VIEs. The primary sources and uses of cash at Apollo's consolidated funds and VIEs include: (a) raising capital from their investors, which have been reflected historically as Non-Controlling Interests of the consolidated subsidiaries in our financial statements, (b) using capital to make investments, (c) generating cash flows from operations through distributions, interest and the realization of investments, (d) distributing cash flow to investors, (e) issuing debt to finance investments (CLOs) and (f) raising capital through SPAC vehicles for future acquisition of targeted entities.\nOther Liquidity and Capital Resource Considerations\nFuture Cash Flows\nOur ability to execute our business strategy, particularly our ability to increase our AUM, depends on our ability to establish new funds and to raise additional investor capital within such funds. Our liquidity will depend on a number of factors, such as our ability to project our financial performance, which is highly dependent on our funds and our ability to manage our projected costs, fund performance, access to credit facilities, compliance with existing credit agreements, as well as industry and market trends. Also during economic downturns the funds we manage might experience cash flow issues or liquidate entirely. In these situations we might be asked to reduce or eliminate the management fee and performance fees we charge, which could adversely impact our cash flow in the future.\nAn increase in the fair value of our funds' investments, by contrast, could favorably impact our liquidity through higher management fees where the management fees are calculated based on the net asset value, gross assets or adjusted assets. Additionally, higher performance fees not yet realized would generally result when investments appreciate over their cost basis which would not have an impact on the Company's cash flow until realized.\nIncome Taxes\nEffective September 5, 2019, Apollo Global Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, converted to a Delaware corporation named Apollo Global Management, Inc. Subsequent to the Conversion, generally all of the income is subject to U.S. corporate income taxes, which could result in an overall higher income tax expense (or benefit) in periods subsequent to the Conversion.\nConsideration of Financing Arrangements\nAs noted above, in limited circumstances, the Company may issue debt or equity to supplement its liquidity. The decision to enter into a particular financing arrangement is made after careful consideration of various factors including the Company's cash flows from operations, future cash needs, current sources of liquidity, demand for the Company's debt or equity, and prevailing interest rates.\nRevolver Facility\nUnder the Company's AMH Credit Facility, the Company may borrow in an aggregate amount not to exceed $750 million and may incur incremental facilities in an aggregate amount not to exceed $250 million plus additional amounts so long as the Borrower is in compliance with a net leverage ratio not to exceed 4.00 to 1.00. Borrowings under the AMH Credit Facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including without limitation, permitted acquisitions. The AMH Credit Facility has a final maturity date of November 23, 2025. The AMH Credit Facility refinanced the 2018 AMH Credit Facility at substantially the same terms. The 2018 AMH Credit Facility and all related loan documents were terminated as of November 23, 2020.\nDividends and Distributions\nFor information regarding the quarterly dividends and distributions which were made at the sole discretion of the Company's Former Manager prior to the Conversion to Class A shareholders, Non-Controlling Interest holders in the Apollo Operating Group and participating securities, see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAlthough the Company expects to pay dividends according to our dividend policy, we may not pay dividends according to our policy, or at all, if, among other things, we do not have the cash necessary to pay the intended dividends. To the extent we do not have cash on hand sufficient to pay dividends, we may have to borrow funds to pay dividends, or we may determine not to pay dividends. The declaration, payment and determination of the amount of our quarterly dividends are at the sole discretion of the executive committee of our board of directors.\nOur current intention is to distribute to our Class A shareholders on a quarterly basis substantially all of our Distributable Earnings attributable to Class A shareholders, in excess of amounts determined by the executive committee of our board of directors to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business and, at a minimum, a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share.\nOn February 3, 2021, the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.60 per Class A share, which will be paid on February 26, 2021 to holders of record at the close of business on February 19, 2021. Also, the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.398438 per share of Series A Preferred share and Series B Preferred share which will be paid on March 15, 2021 to holders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2021.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nThe tax receivable agreement provides for the payment to the Managing Partners and Contributing Partners of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes that AGM Inc. and its subsidiaries realizes subject to the agreement. For more information regarding the tax receivable agreement, see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.\nShare Repurchases\nFor information regarding the Company's share repurchase program, see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAthora\nOn April 14, 2017, Apollo made a commitment of \u20ac125 million to purchase new Class B-1 equity interests in Athora, a strategic platform that acquires and reinsures traditional closed life insurance policies and provides capital and reinsurance solutions to insurers in Europe which, as of April 2020 was fully drawn. In January 2018, Apollo purchased Class C-1 equity interests in Athora that represent a profits interest in Athora which, upon meeting certain vesting triggers, will be convertible by Apollo into additional Class B-1 equity interests in Athora.\nAs part of an ongoing capital raise in connection with Athora's acquisition of VIVAT N.V., Apollo exercised its preemptive rights and made an additional incremental commitment of approximately \u20ac58 million to purchase new Class B-1 equity interests in Athora. In addition, in April 2020, Apollo purchased Class C-2 equity interests in Athora that represent a profits interest in Athora which, upon meeting certain vesting triggers, will be convertible by Apollo into additional Class B-1 equity interests in Athora.\nApollo and Athene are minority investors in Athora with a long term strategic relationship. Through its share ownership, Apollo has approximately 19% of the total voting power in Athora, and Athene holds shares in Athora representing 10% of the total voting power in Athora. In addition, Athora shares held by funds and other accounts managed by Apollo represent, in the aggregate, approximately 16% of the total voting power in Athora.\nFor more information regarding unfunded general partner commitments, see -Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d.\nFund VIII, Fund VII, Fund VI, ANRP I and ANRP II Escrow\nAs of December 31, 2020, the remaining investments and escrow cash of Fund VII, Fund VI, ANRP I and ANRP II were valued at 52%, 34%, 22% and 83% of the fund's unreturned capital, respectively, which were below the required escrow ratio of 115%. As a result, these funds are required to place in escrow current and future performance fee distributions to the general partner until the specified return ratio of 115% is met (at the time of a future distribution) or upon liquidation. Realized performance fees currently distributed to the general partner are limited to potential tax distributions and interest on escrow balances per these funds' partnership agreements.\nNetting Hole\nAs of December 31, 2020, the netting hole for Fund VIII was $266 million. A netting hole is a timing concept that refers to the amount of invested capital, allocable fund level fees and expenses required to be returned to investors in a fund from future investment realized gains of the fund before Apollo can receive additional amounts of realized performance fees.\nClawback\nPerformance fees from our private equity funds and certain credit and real assets funds are subject to contingent repayment by the general partner in the event of future losses to the extent that the cumulative performance fees distributed from inception to date exceeds the amount computed as due to the general partner at the final distribution. See -Overview of Results of Operations-Performance Fees\u201d for the maximum performance fees subject to potential reversal by each fund.\nIndemnification Liability\nThe Company recorded an indemnification liability in the event that our Managing Partners, Contributing Partners and certain investment professionals are required to pay amounts in connection with a general partner obligation to return previously distributed performance fees. See note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company's indemnification liability.\nInvestment Management Agreements - ISG\nThe Company provides asset management and advisory services to Athene as described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe base management fee covers a range of investment services that Athene receives from the Company, including investment management, asset allocation, mergers and acquisition asset diligence and certain operational support services such as investment compliance, tax, legal and risk management support, among others. Additionally, the amended fee agreement provides for a possible payment by the Company to Athene, or a possible payment by Athene to the Company, equal to 0.025% of the Incremental Value as of the end of each year, beginning on December 31, 2019, depending upon the percentage of Athene's investments that consist of core assets and core plus assets. In furtherance of yield support for Athene, if more than\n60% of Athene's invested assets which are subject to the sub-allocation fees are invested in core and core plus assets, Athene will receive a 0.025% fee reduction on the Incremental Value. As an incentive for differentiated asset management, if less than 50% of Athene's invested assets which are subject to the sub-allocation fee are invested in core and core plus assets, thereby reflecting a higher allocation toward assets with the highest alpha-generating abilities, Athene will pay an additional fee of 0.025% on Incremental Value.\nThe amended fee agreement is intended to provide for further alignment of interests between Athene and the Company. On the Backbook Value, assuming constant portfolio allocations, the near-term impact of the amended fee agreement is anticipated to be immaterial. On the Incremental Value, assuming the same allocations as the Backbook Value, total fees paid by Athene to the Company are expected to be marginally lower than fees paid by Athene to the Company would have been under the prior fee arrangement. If invested asset allocations are more heavily weighted to assets with lower alpha-generating abilities than Athene's current investment portfolio, the fees that Athene pays to the Company under the amended fee agreement would be expected to decline relative to the prior fee arrangement. Conversely, if a greater proportion of Athene's investment portfolio is allocated to differentiated assets with higher alpha-generating abilities, Athene's net investment earned rates would be expected to increase, and so would the fees Athene pays to the Company relative to the prior fee arrangement.\nStrategic Transaction with Athene Holding\nOn October 27, 2019 Athene Holding, AGM Inc. and the entities that form the Apollo Operating Group entered into the Transaction Agreement. Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, Athene Holding issued on February 28, 2020, 35,534,942 AHL Class A Common Shares to certain subsidiaries of the Apollo Operating Group in exchange for (i) issuance by the Apollo Operating Group of 29,154,519 non-voting equity interests of the Apollo Operating Group to Athene Holding and (ii) $350 million in cash. See note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Transaction Agreement with Athene Holding.\nEquity-Based Profit Sharing Expense\nProfit sharing amounts are generally not paid until the related performance fees are distributed to the general partner upon realization of the fund's investments. Under certain profit sharing arrangements, a portion of the performance fees distributed to the general partner is allocated by issuance of equity-based awards, rather than cash, to employees. See note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the accounting for the Company's profit sharing arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The following is a summary of our accounting policies that are affected most by judgments, estimates and assumptions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created disruption and uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets. Although we cannot predict with certainty the full magnitude of the economic ramifications, we have accounted for pandemic-related circumstances when applying judgments and assumptions and updated our estimates accordingly when and as applicable.\nConsolidation\nThe Company assesses all entities with which it is involved for consolidation on a case by case basis depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding each entity. Pursuant to the consolidation guidance, the Company first evaluates whether it holds a variable interest in an entity. Apollo factors in all economic interests including proportionate interests through related parties, to determine if such interests are to be considered a variable interest. As Apollo's interest in many of these entities is solely through market rate fees and/or insignificant indirect interests through related parties, Apollo is generally not considered to have a variable interest in many of these entities under the guidance and no further consolidation analysis is performed. For entities where the Company has determined that it does hold a variable interest, the Company performs an assessment to determine whether each of those entities qualify as a VIE.\nThe determination as to whether an entity qualifies as a VIE depends on the facts and circumstances surrounding each entity and therefore certain of Apollo's funds may qualify as VIEs under the variable interest model whereas others may\nqualify as voting interest entities ( VOEs\u201d) under the voting interest model. The granting of substantive kick-out rights is a key consideration in determining whether a limited partnership or similar entity is a VIE and whether or not that entity should be consolidated.\nUnder the voting interest model, Apollo consolidates those entities it controls through a majority voting interest. Apollo does not consolidate those VOEs in which substantive kick-out rights have been granted to the unaffiliated investors to either dissolve the fund or remove the general partner.\nUnder the variable interest model, Apollo consolidates those entities where it is determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of the entity.\nThe assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and the determination of whether Apollo should consolidate such VIE requires judgment by our management. Those judgments include, but are not limited to: (i) determining whether the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (ii) evaluating whether the holders of equity investment at risk, as a group, can make decisions that have a significant effect on the success of the entity, (iii) determining whether the equity investors have proportionate voting rights to their obligations to absorb losses or rights to receive the expected residual returns from an entity and (iv) evaluating the nature of the relationship and activities of those related parties with shared power or under common control for purposes of determining which party within the related-party group is most closely associated with the VIE. Judgments are also made in determining whether a member in the equity group has a controlling financial interest including power to direct activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and rights to receive benefits or obligations to absorb losses that could be potentially significant to the VIE. This analysis considers all relevant economic interests including proportionate interests held through related parties.\nRevenue Recognition\nPerformance Fees. We earn performance fees from our funds as a result of such funds achieving specified performance criteria. Such performance fees generally are earned based upon a fixed percentage of realized and unrealized gains of various funds after meeting any applicable hurdle rate or threshold minimum.\nPerformance allocations are performance fees that are generally structured from a legal standpoint as an allocation of capital to the Company. Performance allocations from certain of the funds that we manage are subject to contingent repayment and are generally paid to us as particular investments made by the funds are realized. If, however, upon liquidation of a fund, the aggregate amount paid to us as performance fees exceeds the amount actually due to us based upon the aggregate performance of the fund, the excess (in certain cases net of taxes) is required to be returned by us to that fund. We account for performance allocations as an equity method investment, and accordingly, we accrue performance allocations quarterly based on fair value of the underlying investments and separately assess if contingent repayment is necessary. The determination of performance allocations and contingent repayment considers both the terms of the respective partnership agreements and the current fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used. See Investments, at Fair Value\u201d below for further discussion related to significant estimates and assumptions used for determining fair value of the underlying investments in our credit, private equity and real assets funds.\nIncentive fees are performance fees structured as a contractual fee arrangement rather than a capital allocation. Incentive fees are generally received from the management of CLOs, managed accounts and AINV. For a majority of our incentive fees, once the quarterly or annual incentive fees have been determined, there is no look-back to prior periods for a potential contingent repayment, however, certain other incentive fees can be subject to contingent repayment at the end of the life of the entity. In accordance with the revenue recognition standard, certain incentive fees are considered a form of variable consideration and therefore are deferred until fees are probable to not be significantly reversed. There is significant judgment involved in determining if the incentive fees are probable to not be significantly reversed, but generally the Company will defer the revenue until the fees are crystallized or are no longer subject to clawback or reversal.\nManagement Fees. Management fees related to our credit funds, can be based on net asset value, gross assets, adjusted cost of all unrealized portfolio investments, capital commitments, adjusted assets, capital contributions, or stockholders' equity all as defined in the respective partnership agreements. The credit management fee calculations that consider net asset value, gross assets, adjusted cost of all unrealized portfolio investments and adjusted assets are normally based on the terms of the respective partnership agreements and the current fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used. The management fees related to our private equity funds, by contrast, are generally based on a fixed percentage of the committed capital or invested capital. The corresponding fee\ncalculations that consider committed capital or invested capital are both objective in nature and therefore do not require the use of significant estimates or assumptions. The management fees related to our real assets funds are generally based on a specific percentage of the funds' stockholders' equity or committed or net invested capital or the capital accounts of the limited partners. See Investments, at Fair Value\u201d below for further discussion related to significant estimates and assumptions used for determining fair value of the underlying investments in our credit, private equity and real assets funds.\nInvestments, at Fair Value\nOn a quarterly basis, Apollo utilizes valuation committees consisting of members from senior management, to review and approve the valuation results related to the investments of the funds it manages. For certain publicly traded vehicles managed by Apollo, a review is performed by an independent board of directors. The Company also retains external valuation firms to provide third-party valuation consulting services to Apollo, which consist of certain limited procedures that management identifies and requests them to perform. The limited procedures provided by the external valuation firms assist management with validating their valuation results or determining fair value. The Company performs various back-testing procedures to validate their valuation approaches, including comparisons between expected and observed outcomes, forecast evaluations and variance analyses. However, because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, the estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and the differences could be material.\nThe fair values of the investments in our funds can be impacted by changes to the assumptions used in the underlying valuation models. For further discussion on the impact of changes to valuation assumptions see", "summary": "The report provides a detailed overview of Apollo Global Management, Inc.'s financial condition, operations, and business segments. It discusses the company's founding, business model, segment performance, AUM, management changes, and key financial measures. It also highlights financial market conditions and their impact on the company's operations. Additionally, it explains the organizational structure, including the company's conversion to a C corporation, and describes the management's approach to analyzing business performance. Finally, it covers performance fee-eligible AUM, fee-generating AUM, and Athene sub-allocated total AUM.", "item_7_tables": "Table 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Apollo Global Management, Inc.'s consolidated financial statements and the related notes as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ significantly from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those included in the section of this report entitled Item 1A Risk Factors.\u201d The highlights listed below have had significant effects on many items within our consolidated financial statements and affect the comparison of the current period's activity with those of prior periods.\nGeneral\nOur Businesses\nFounded in 1990, Apollo is a leading global alternative investment manager. We are a contrarian, value-oriented investment manager in credit, private equity and real assets with significant distressed expertise and a flexible mandate in the majority of our funds which enables our funds to invest opportunistically across a company's capital structure. We raise, invest and manage funds on behalf of some of the world's most prominent pension, endowment and sovereign wealth funds as well as other institutional and individual investors. Apollo is led by our Managing Partners, Leon Black, Joshua Harris and Marc Rowan, who have worked together for more than 34 years and lead a team of 1,729 employees, including 557 investment professionals, as of December 31, 2020.\nApollo conducts its business primarily in the United States through the following three reportable segments:\n(i)Credit-primarily invests in non-control corporate and structured debt instruments including performing, stressed and distressed instruments across the capital structure;\n(ii)Private equity-primarily invests in control equity and related debt instruments, convertible securities and distressed debt instruments; and\n(iii)Real assets-primarily invests in (i) real estate equity and infrastructure equity for the acquisition and recapitalization of real estate and infrastructure assets, portfolios, platforms and operating companies, (ii) real estate and infrastructure debt including first mortgage and mezzanine loans, preferred equity and commercial mortgage backed securities and (iii) European performing and non-performing loans, and unsecured consumer loans.\nThese business segments are differentiated based on the varying investment strategies. The performance is measured by management on an unconsolidated basis because management makes operating decisions and assesses the performance of each of Apollo's business segments based on financial and operating metrics and data that exclude the effects of consolidation of any of the managed funds.\nOur financial results vary since performance fees, which generally constitute a large portion of the income we receive from the funds that we manage, as well as the transaction and advisory fees that we receive, can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. As a result, we emphasize long-term financial growth and profitability to manage our business.\nIn addition, the growth in our Fee-Generating AUM during the last year has primarily been in our credit segment driven by continued growth in traditional funds and managed accounts as well as growth in asset management services to the insurance industry and in performing credit products. The average management fee rate for these new credit products is at market rates for such products and in certain cases is below our historical rates. Also, due to the complexity of these new product offerings, the Company has incurred and will continue to incur additional costs associated with managing these products. To date, these additional costs have been offset by realized economies of scale and ongoing cost management.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had total AUM of $455.5 billion across all of our businesses. More than 90% of our total AUM was in funds with a contractual life at inception of five years or more, and 60% of such AUM was in permanent capital vehicles.\nThe following table presents the gross and net returns for Apollo's credit segment by category type:\n\nOn December 31, 2017, Fund IX held its final closing, raising a total of $23.5 billion in third-party capital and approximately $1.2 billion of additional capital from Apollo and affiliated investors for total commitments of $24.7 billion. On December 31, 2013, Fund VIII held a final closing raising a total of $17.5 billion in third-party capital and approximately $880 million of additional capital from Apollo and affiliated investors, and as of December 31, 2020, Fund VIII had $2.5 billion of uncalled commitments remaining. Additionally, Fund VII held a final closing in December 2008, raising a total of $14.7 billion, and as of December 31, 2020, Fund VII had $1.8 billion of uncalled commitments remaining. We have consistently produced attractive long-term investment returns in our traditional private equity funds, generating a 39% gross IRR and a 24% net IRR on a compound annual basis from inception through December 31, 2020. Apollo's private equity fund appreciation was 6.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nFor our real assets segment, there was a total gross return of 1.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020, which represents gross return for our real estate equity funds and their co-investment capital, the European principal finance funds, and infrastructure equity funds.\nFor further detail related to fund performance metrics across all of our businesses, see -The Historical Investment Performance of Our Funds.\u201d\nHolding Company Structure\nThe diagram below depicts our current organizational structure:\nNote: The organizational structure chart above depicts a simplified version of the Apollo structure. It does not include all legal entities in the structure. Ownership percentages are as of February 18, 2021. As of February 18, 2021, there were 231,966,014 Class A shares, 1 Class B share and 1 Class C share issued and outstanding, and 173,178,263 AOG Units held by Holdings that are exchangeable for Class A shares on a one-for-one basis. In addition, as of February 18, 2021, Athene held 29,154,519 AOG Units that are non-voting equity interests of the Apollo Operating Group and are not exchangeable for Class A shares.\n(1)As of February 18, 2021, the Class A shares represented 9.2% of the total voting power of the Class A shares, the Class B share and the Class C share, voting together as a single class, with respect to General Stockholder Matters. As of February 18, 2021, the Class A shares represented 53.4% of the total voting power of the Class A shares and the Class B share with respect to certain matters upon which they are entitled to vote pursuant to the certificate of incorporation of AGM Inc. ( COI\u201d).\n(2)Our Managing Partners own BRH Holdings GP, Ltd., which in turn holds our only outstanding Class B share. As of February 18, 2021, the Class B share represented 8.0% of the total voting power of the Class A shares, the Class B share and the Class C share, voting together as a single class, with respect to General Stockholder Matters, and a de minimus economic interest in AGM Inc. As of February 18, 2021, the Class B share represented 46.6% of the total voting power of the Class A shares and the Class B share with respect to certain matters upon which they are entitled to vote as a single class.\n(3)Through BRH Holdings, L.P., our Managing Partners indirectly beneficially own through estate planning vehicles, limited partner interests in Holdings. Our Managing Partners' economic interests are represented by their indirect beneficial ownership, through Holdings, of 36.1% of the limited partner interests in the Apollo Operating Group.\n(4)Holdings owns 39.9% of the limited partner or limited liability company interests in each Apollo Operating Group entity. The AOG Units held by Holdings are exchangeable for Class A shares. Our Managing Partners, through their interests in BRH and Holdings, beneficially own 36.1% of the AOG Units. Our Contributing Partners, through their interests in Holdings, beneficially own 3.8% of the AOG Units.\n(5)BRH Holdings GP, Ltd. is the sole member of AGM Management, LLC, which in turns holds our only outstanding Class C share. The Class C share bestows to its holder certain management rights over AGM Inc. As of February 18, 2021, the Class C share represented 82.8% of the total voting power of the Class A shares, the Class B share and the Class C share, voting together as a single class, with respect to General Stockholder Matters, and a de minimus economic interest in AGM Inc.\n(6)Represents 53.4% of the limited partner or limited liability company interests in each Apollo Operating Group entity, held through the intermediate holding companies. AGM Inc. also indirectly owns 100% of the general partner or managing member interests in each Apollo Operating Group entity.\n(7)Represents 6.7% of the limited partner or limited liability company interests in each Apollo Operating Group entity held by Athene Holding Ltd. and/or its affiliates. AOG Units held by Athene are non-voting equity interests of the Apollo Operating Group and are not exchangeable for Class A shares.\nEach of the Apollo Operating Group entities holds interests in different businesses or entities organized in different jurisdictions.\nOur structure is designed to accomplish a number of objectives, the most important of which are as follows:\n\u2022Historically, we were a holding company that was qualified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our intermediate holding companies enabled us to maintain our partnership status and to meet the qualifying income exception. Effective September 5, 2019, Apollo Global Management, LLC converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation named Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\u2022We have historically used multiple management companies to segregate operations for business, financial and other reasons. Going forward, we may increase or decrease the number of our management companies, partnerships or other entities within the Apollo Operating Group based on our views regarding the appropriate balance between (a) administrative convenience and (b) continued business, financial, tax and other optimization.\nConversion to a C Corporation\nEffective September 5, 2019, Apollo Global Management, LLC converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation named Apollo Global Management, Inc. Prior to the Conversion, a portion of the investment income, performance allocations and principal investment income we earned was not subject to corporate-level tax in the United States. Subsequent to the Conversion, generally all of the income is subject to U.S. corporate income taxes, which could result in an overall higher income tax expense (or benefit) in periods subsequent to the Conversion.\nBusiness Environment\nAs a global investment manager, we are affected by numerous factors, including the condition of financial markets and the economy. Price fluctuations within equity, credit, commodity, foreign exchange markets, as well as interest rates, which may be volatile and mixed across geographies, can significantly impact the valuation of our funds' portfolio companies and related income we may recognize.\nIn the U.S., the S&P 500 Index increased by 16.3% in 2020, following an increase of 28.9% in 2019. Global equity markets also appreciated during the year, with the MSCI All Country World ex USA Index increasing 8.1% following an increase of 23.2% in 2019.\nConditions in the credit markets also have a significant impact on our business. Credit markets were positive in 2020, with the BofAML HY Master II Index increasing by 6.2%, while the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index increased by 2.8%. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield at the end of the year was 0.93%. The Federal Reserve lowered the benchmark interest rate two times during the year, for a target range of 0% to 0.25% at the end of 2020, down from to a target range of 1.50% to 1.75% at the end of 2019.\nForeign exchange rates can materially impact the valuations of our investments and those of our funds that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Relative to the U.S. dollar, the Euro appreciated 9.0% during the year, after depreciating by 2.2% in 2019, while the British pound appreciated 3.1% in 2020, after appreciating 3.9% in 2019. The price of crude oil depreciated by 20.5% during 2020, after appreciating by 34.5% during 2019.\nIn terms of economic conditions in the U.S., the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported real GDP decreased at an annual rate of 3.5% in 2020, following an increase of 2.1% in 2019. As of January 2021, the International Monetary Fund estimated that the U.S. economy will expand by 5.1% in 2021 and 2.5% in 2022. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. unemployment rate stood at 6.7% as of December 31, 2020.\nRegardless of the market or economic environment at any given time, Apollo relies on its contrarian, value-oriented approach to consistently invest capital on behalf of its fund investors by focusing on opportunities that management believes are often overlooked by other investors. As such, Apollo's global integrated investment platform deployed $88.2 billion of capital through the funds it manages during the year ended December 31, 2020. Drawdown capital deployed was $17.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe Apollo's expertise in credit and its focus on nine core industry sectors, combined with more than 30 years of investment experience, has allowed Apollo to respond quickly to changing environments.\nApollo's core industry sectors include chemicals, manufacturing and industrial, natural resources, consumer and retail, consumer services, business services, financial services, leisure, and media/telecom/technology. Apollo believes that these attributes have contributed to the success of its private equity funds investing in buyouts and credit opportunities during both expansionary and recessionary economic periods.\nIn general, institutional investors continue to allocate capital towards alternative investment managers for more attractive risk-adjusted returns in a low interest rate environment, and we believe the business environment remains generally accommodative to raise larger successor funds, launch new products, and pursue attractive strategic growth opportunities, such as continuing to grow the assets of our permanent capital vehicles. As such, Apollo had $122.7 billion of capital inflows during the year ended December 31, 2020. Apollo returned $8.7 billion of capital and realized gains to the investors in the funds it manages during the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively.\nOn October 20, 2020, at a regularly scheduled meeting of AGM Inc.'s board of directors, Apollo's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Leon Black, requested that the conflicts committee of the board of directors (comprised of independent directors) retain outside counsel to conduct a thorough review of, and independently confirm, the information that Mr. Black has conveyed about his previous professional relationship with Mr. Jeffrey Epstein. The conflicts committee had retained Dechert LLP as outside counsel to conduct a thorough, independent review which included interviewing individuals and examining relevant documents.\nOn January 25, 2021, the Company announced that the conflicts committee of the board of directors has completed its previously announced independent review of Chairman and CEO Leon Black's previous professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and publicly released the review's findings. The findings of the report are consistent with statements made by Mr. Black and Apollo regarding the prior relationship.\nOn January 25, 2021, the Company announced that, at a meeting of the executive committee of our board of directors on January 24, 2021, Mr. Black informed the executive committee members that he intends to retire from his position as Chief Executive Officer of the Company on or before July 31, 2021. Leon Black, Marc Rowan and Josh Harris, on behalf of our Class C Stockholder, voted to appoint Mr. Rowan as our Chief Executive Officer to begin serving in such role effective upon Mr. Black's retirement. Mr. Black will continue to serve as Chairman of our board of directors following his retirement from his position as Chief Executive Officer.\nManaging Business Performance\nWe believe that the presentation of Segment DE supplements a reader's understanding of the economic operating performance of each of our segments.\nSegment Distributable Earnings and Distributable Earnings\nSegment DE is the key performance measure used by management in evaluating the performance of Apollo's credit, private equity and real assets segments. See note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding the components of Segment DE. DE represents Segment DE less estimated current corporate, local and non-U.S. taxes as well as the current payable under Apollo's tax receivable agreement. DE is net of preferred dividends, if any, to the Series A and Series B preferred stockholders. DE excludes the impacts of the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities which arises from changes in estimated future tax rates. The economic assumptions and methodologies that impact the implied income tax provision are similar to those methodologies and certain assumptions used in calculating the income tax provision for Apollo's consolidated statements of operations under U.S. GAAP. Specifically, certain deductions considered in the income tax provision under U.S. GAAP, such as the deduction for transaction related charges and equity-based compensation, are taken into account for purposes of the implied tax provision. Management believes that excluding the remeasurement of the tax receivable agreement and deferred taxes from Segment DE and DE, respectively, is meaningful as it increases comparability between periods. Remeasurement of the tax receivable agreement and deferred taxes are estimates that may change due to changes in the interpretation of tax law.\nWe believe that Segment DE is helpful for an understanding of our business and that investors should review the same supplemental financial measure that management uses to analyze our segment performance. This measure supplements and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed below in -Overview of Results of Operations\u201d that have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding management's consideration of Segment DE.\nFee Related Earnings and Fee Related EBITDA\nFee Related Earnings, or FRE\u201d, is derived from our segment reported results and refers to a component of Segment DE that is used as a supplemental performance measure. See note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding the components of FRE.\nFee related EBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP measure derived from our segment reported results and is used to assess the performance of our operations as well as our ability to service current and future borrowings. Fee related EBITDA represents FRE plus amounts for depreciation and amortization. Fee related EBITDA +100% of net realized performance fees\u201d represents Fee related EBITDA plus realized performance fees less realized profit sharing expense.\nWe use Segment DE, DE, FRE and Fee related EBITDA as measures of operating performance, not as measures of liquidity. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other income data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The use of these measures without consideration of their related U.S. GAAP measures is not adequate due to the adjustments described above.\nOperating Metrics\nWe monitor certain operating metrics that are common to the alternative investment management industry. These operating metrics include Assets Under Management, capital deployed and uncalled commitments.\nAssets Under Management\nThe following presents Apollo's Total AUM and Fee-Generating AUM by segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 (in billions):\n Note: Totals may not add due to rounding \nThe following presents Apollo's AUM with Future Management Fee Potential for each of Apollo's three segments as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 (in billions):\n Note: Totals may not add due to rounding \nThe following table presents the components of Performance Fee-Eligible AUM for each of Apollo's three segments:\n\n(1)Performance Fee-Generating AUM of $1.6 billion and $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, are above the hurdle rates or preferred returns and have been deferred to future periods when the fees are probable to not be significantly reversed.\n(2)Effective as of June 30, 2020, Performance Fee-Eligible AUM for Athora includes only capital commitments. Prior period Performance Fee-Eligible AUM has been conformed to reflect this change in presentation.\nThe following table presents AUM Not Currently Generating Performance Fees for funds that have invested capital for more than 24 months as of December 31, 2020 and the corresponding appreciation required to reach the preferred return or high watermark in order to generate performance fees:\n\n(1)All investors in a given fund are considered in aggregate when calculating the appreciation required to achieve performance fees presented above.

The Company, through ISG, also provides sub-allocation services with respect to a portion of the assets in the Athene Accounts. See note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding the fee rates of the investment management and sub-allocation fee arrangements with respect to the assets in the Athene Accounts.\nThe following table presents the aggregate Athene Sub-Allocated Total AUM by asset class:\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Apollo's private equity fund appreciation was 6.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nFor our real assets segment, there was a total gross return of 1.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020, which represents gross return for our real estate equity funds and their co-investment capital, the European principal finance funds, and infrastructure equity funds.\nFor further detail related to fund performance metrics across all of our businesses, see -The Historical Investment Performance of Our Funds.\u201d\nHolding Company Structure\nThe diagram below depicts our current organizational structure:\nNote: The organizational structure chart above depicts a simplified version of the Apollo structure. It does not include all legal entities in the structure. Ownership percentages are as of February 18, 2021. As of February 18, 2021, there were 231,966,014 Class A shares, 1 Class B share and 1 Class C share issued and outstanding, and 173,178,263 AOG Units held by Holdings that are exchangeable for Class A shares on a one-for-one basis. In addition, as of February 18, 2021, Athene held 29,154,519 AOG Units that are non-voting equity interests of the Apollo Operating Group and are not exchangeable for Class A shares.\n(1)As of February 18, 2021, the Class A shares represented 9.2% of the total voting power of the Class A shares, the Class B share and the Class C share, voting together as a single class, with respect to General Stockholder Matters. As of February 18, 2021, the Class A shares represented 53.4% of the total voting power of the Class A shares and the Class B share with respect to certain matters upon which they are entitled to vote pursuant to the certificate of incorporation of AGM Inc. ( COI\u201d).\n(2)Our Managing Partners own BRH Holdings GP, Ltd., which in turn holds our only outstanding Class B share. As of February 18, 2021, the Class B share represented 8.0% of the total voting power of the Class A shares, the Class B share and the Class C share, voting together as a single class, with respect to General Stockholder Matters, and a de minimus economic interest in AGM Inc. As of February 18, 2021, the Class B share represented 46.6% of the total voting power of the Class A shares and the Class B share with respect to certain matters upon which they are entitled to vote as a single class.\n(3)Through BRH Holdings, L.P., our Managing Partners indirectly beneficially own through estate planning vehicles, limited partner interests in Holdings. Our Managing Partners' economic interests are represented by their indirect beneficial ownership, through Holdings, of 36.1% of the limited partner interests in the Apollo Operating Group.\n(4)Holdings owns 39.9% of the limited partner or limited liability company interests in each Apollo Operating Group entity. The AOG Units held by Holdings are exchangeable for Class A shares. Our Managing Partners, through their interests in BRH and Holdings, beneficially own 36.1% of the AOG Units. Our Contributing Partners, through their interests in Holdings, beneficially own 3.8% of the AOG Units.\n(5)BRH Holdings GP, Ltd. is the sole member of AGM Management, LLC, which in turns holds our only outstanding Class C share. The Class C share bestows to its holder certain management rights over AGM Inc. As of February 18, 2021, the Class C share represented 82.8% of the total voting power of the Class A shares, the Class B share and the Class C share, voting together as a single class, with respect to General Stockholder Matters, and a de minimus economic interest in AGM Inc.\n(6)Represents 53.4% of the limited partner or limited liability company interests in each Apollo Operating Group entity, held through the intermediate holding companies. AGM Inc. also indirectly owns 100% of the general partner or managing member interests in each Apollo Operating Group entity.\n(7)Represents 6.7% of the limited partner or limited liability company interests in each Apollo Operating Group entity held by Athene Holding Ltd. and/or its affiliates. AOG Units held by Athene are non-voting equity interests of the Apollo Operating Group and are not exchangeable for Class A shares.\nEach of the Apollo Operating Group entities holds interests in different businesses or entities organized in different jurisdictions.\nOur structure is designed to accomplish a number of objectives, the most important of which are as follows:\n\u2022Historically, we were a holding company that was qualified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our intermediate holding companies enabled us to maintain our partnership status and to meet the qualifying income exception. Effective September 5, 2019, Apollo Global Management, LLC converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation named Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\u2022We have historically used multiple management companies to segregate operations for business, financial and other reasons. Going forward, we may increase or decrease the number of our management companies, partnerships or other entities within the Apollo Operating Group based on our views regarding the appropriate balance between (a) administrative convenience and (b) continued business, financial, tax and other optimization.\nConversion to a C Corporation\nEffective September 5, 2019, Apollo Global Management, LLC converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation named Apollo Global Management, Inc. Prior to the Conversion, a portion of the investment income, performance allocations and principal investment income we earned was not subject to corporate-level tax in the United States. Subsequent to the Conversion, generally all of the income is subject to U.S. corporate income taxes, which could result in an overall higher income tax expense (or benefit) in periods subsequent to the Conversion.\nBusiness Environment\nAs a global investment manager, we are affected by numerous factors, including the condition of financial markets and the economy. Price fluctuations within equity, credit, commodity, foreign exchange markets, as well as interest rates, which may be volatile and mixed across geographies, can significantly impact the valuation of our funds' portfolio companies and related income we may recognize.\nIn the U.S., the S&P 500 Index increased by 16.3% in 2020, following an increase of 28.9% in 2019. Global equity markets also appreciated during the year, with the MSCI All Country World ex USA Index increasing 8.1% following an increase of 23.2% in 2019.\nConditions in the credit markets also have a significant impact on our business. Credit markets were positive in 2020, with the BofAML HY Master II Index increasing by 6.2%, while the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index increased by 2.8%. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield at the end of the year was 0.93%. The Federal Reserve lowered the benchmark interest rate two times during the year, for a target range of 0% to 0.25% at the end of 2020, down from to a target range of 1.50% to 1.75% at the end of 2019.\nForeign exchange rates can materially impact the valuations of our investments and those of our funds that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Relative to the U.S. dollar, the Euro appreciated 9.0% during the year, after depreciating by 2.2% in 2019, while the British pound appreciated 3.1% in 2020, after appreciating 3.9% in 2019. The price of crude oil depreciated by 20.5% during 2020, after appreciating by 34.5% during 2019.\nIn terms of economic conditions in the U.S., the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported real GDP decreased at an annual rate of 3.5% in 2020, following an increase of 2.1% in 2019. As of January 2021, the International Monetary Fund estimated that the U.S. economy will expand by 5.1% in 2021 and 2.5% in 2022. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. unemployment rate stood at 6.7% as of December 31, 2020.\nRegardless of the market or economic environment at any given time, Apollo relies on its contrarian, value-oriented approach to consistently invest capital on behalf of its fund investors by focusing on opportunities that management believes are often overlooked by other investors. As such, Apollo's global integrated investment platform deployed $88.2 billion of capital through the funds it manages during the year ended December 31, 2020. Drawdown capital deployed was $17.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe Apollo's expertise in credit and its focus on nine core industry sectors, combined with more than 30 years of investment experience, has allowed Apollo to respond quickly to changing environments.\nApollo's core industry sectors include chemicals, manufacturing and industrial, natural resources, consumer and retail, consumer services, business services, financial services, leisure, and media/telecom/technology. Apollo believes that these attributes have contributed to the success of its private equity funds investing in buyouts and credit opportunities during both expansionary and recessionary economic periods.\nIn general, institutional investors continue to allocate capital towards alternative investment managers for more attractive risk-adjusted returns in a low interest rate environment, and we believe the business environment remains generally accommodative to raise larger successor funds, launch new products, and pursue attractive strategic growth opportunities, such as continuing to grow the assets of our permanent capital vehicles. As such, Apollo had $122.7 billion of capital inflows during the year ended December 31, 2020. Apollo returned $8.7 billion of capital and realized gains to the investors in the funds it manages during the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively.\nOn October 20, 2020, at a regularly scheduled meeting of AGM Inc.'s board of directors, Apollo's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Leon Black, requested that the conflicts committee of the board of directors (comprised of independent directors) retain outside counsel to conduct a thorough review of, and independently confirm, the information that Mr. Black has conveyed about his previous professional relationship with Mr. Jeffrey Epstein. The conflicts committee had retained Dechert LLP as outside counsel to conduct a thorough, independent review which included interviewing individuals and examining relevant documents.\nOn January 25, 2021, the Company announced that the conflicts committee of the board of directors has completed its previously announced independent review of Chairman and CEO Leon Black's previous professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and publicly released the review's findings. The findings of the report are consistent with statements made by Mr. Black and Apollo regarding the prior relationship.\nOn January 25, 2021, the Company announced that, at a meeting of the executive committee of our board of directors on January 24, 2021, Mr. Black informed the executive committee members that he intends to retire from his position as Chief Executive Officer of the Company on or before July 31, 2021. Leon Black, Marc Rowan and Josh Harris, on behalf of our Class C Stockholder, voted to appoint Mr. Rowan as our Chief Executive Officer to begin serving in such role effective upon Mr. Black's retirement. Mr. Black will continue to serve as Chairman of our board of directors following his retirement from his position as Chief Executive Officer.\nManaging Business Performance\nWe believe that the presentation of Segment DE supplements a reader's understanding of the economic operating performance of each of our segments.\nSegment Distributable Earnings and Distributable Earnings\nSegment DE is the key performance measure used by management in evaluating the performance of Apollo's credit, private equity and real assets segments. See note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding the components of Segment DE. DE represents Segment DE less estimated current corporate, local and non-U.S. taxes as well as the current payable under Apollo's tax receivable agreement. DE is net of preferred dividends, if any, to the Series A and Series B preferred stockholders. DE excludes the impacts of the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities which arises from changes in estimated future tax rates. The economic assumptions and methodologies that impact the implied income tax provision are similar to those methodologies and certain assumptions used in calculating the income tax provision for Apollo's consolidated statements of operations under U.S. GAAP. Specifically, certain deductions considered in the income tax provision under U.S. GAAP, such as the deduction for transaction related charges and equity-based compensation, are taken into account for purposes of the implied tax provision. Management believes that excluding the remeasurement of the tax receivable agreement and deferred taxes from Segment DE and DE, respectively, is meaningful as it increases comparability between periods. Remeasurement of the tax receivable agreement and deferred taxes are estimates that may change due to changes in the interpretation of tax law.\nWe believe that Segment DE is helpful for an understanding of our business and that investors should review the same supplemental financial measure that management uses to analyze our segment performance. This measure supplements and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed below in -Overview of Results of Operations\u201d that have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding management's consideration of Segment DE.\nFee Related Earnings and Fee Related EBITDA\nFee Related Earnings, or FRE\u201d, is derived from our segment reported results and refers to a component of Segment DE that is used as a supplemental performance measure. See note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding the components of FRE.\nFee related EBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP measure derived from our segment reported results and is used to assess the performance of our operations as well as our ability to service current and future borrowings. Fee related EBITDA represents FRE plus amounts for depreciation and amortization. Fee related EBITDA +100% of net realized performance fees\u201d represents Fee related EBITDA plus realized performance fees less realized profit sharing expense.\nWe use Segment DE, DE, FRE and Fee related EBITDA as measures of operating performance, not as measures of liquidity. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other income data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The use of these measures without consideration of their related U.S. GAAP measures is not adequate due to the adjustments described above.\nOperating Metrics\nWe monitor certain operating metrics that are common to the alternative investment management industry. These operating metrics include Assets Under Management, capital deployed and uncalled commitments.\nAssets Under Management\nThe following presents Apollo's Total AUM and Fee-Generating AUM by segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 (in billions):\n Note: Totals may not add due to rounding \nThe following presents Apollo's AUM with Future Management Fee Potential for each of Apollo's three segments as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 (in billions):\n Note: Totals may not add due to rounding \nThe following table presents the components of Performance Fee-Eligible AUM for each of Apollo's three segments:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Credit </td> <td> </td> <td>Private Equity </td> <td> </td> <td>Real Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Credit </td> <td> </td> <td>Private Equity </td> <td> </td> <td>Real Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Fee-Generating AUM(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,886 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>68,867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,907 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,646 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AUM Not Currently Generating Performance Fees </td> <td>16,791 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,889 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,590 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Uninvested Performance Fee-Eligible AUM </td> <td>9,847 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,682 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Performance Fee-Eligible AUM (2)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>134,284 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,918 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Performance Fee-Generating AUM of $1.6 billion and $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, are above the hurdle rates or preferred returns and have been deferred to future periods when the fees are probable to not be significantly reversed.\n(2)Effective as of June 30, 2020, Performance Fee-Eligible AUM for Athora includes only capital commitments.
