Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIndustry Trends and Outlook\nRoom-night demand in the U.S. lodging industry is generally correlated to macroeconomic trends. Key drivers of demand include growth in GDP, corporate profits, capital investments and employment. Although we remain optimistic that our hotel properties will realize RevPAR gains despite the recent volatility of the economy and lodging industry, the risk exists that global and domestic economic conditions may cause the economic growth to slow or stall, which likely would adversely affect our growth expectations.\nThe U.S. lodging industry experienced a positive trend through 2015 that we expect to continue through 2016. According to a report prepared in January 2016 by PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, U.S. RevPAR growth in 2015 for Upscale hotels and Upper-midscale hotels was 5.6% and 6.3%, respectively, while projected 2016 RevPar growth is 4.7% and 5.4% respectively. We continue to have a positive outlook about national macro-economic conditions and their effect on room-night demand; however, as occupancy levels stabilize, growth expectations for fiscal year 2016 are expected to decelerate from those experienced in 2015. While the supply of new hotels under construction has increased and is expected to accelerate in 2016, we expect that our operating results will not be adversely affected to a substantial degree by increased lodging supply in our markets.\nOperating Performance Metrics\nWe use a variety of operating performance indicators and other information to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of our business. These key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as other financial information that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, we use other information that may not be financial in nature, including statistical information and comparative data. We use this information to measure the performance of individual hotel properties, groups of hotel properties and/or our business as a whole. We periodically compare historical information to our internal budgets as well as industry-wide information. These key indicators include:\n\u00b7 Occupancy - Occupancy represents the total number of guestrooms occupied divided by the total number of guestrooms available.\n\u00b7 Average Daily Rate (ADR) - ADR represents total room revenues divided by the total number of guestrooms occupied.\n\u00b7 Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR) - RevPAR is the product of ADR and Occupancy.\nOccupancy, ADR and RevPAR are commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate operating performance. RevPAR is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel property level and across our business as a whole. We evaluate individual hotel RevPAR performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget and prior periods, as well as on a company-wide and regional basis. ADR and RevPAR include only room revenue. Room revenue depends on demand (as measured by occupancy), pricing (as measured by ADR), and our available supply of hotel guestrooms. Our ADR, occupancy and RevPAR performance may be affected by macroeconomic factors such as regional and local employment growth, personal income and corporate earnings, office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions, airport and other business and leisure travel, new hotel property construction, and the pricing strategies of competitors. In addition, our ADR, occupancy and RevPAR performance is dependent on the continued success of our franchisors and brands.\nHotel Property Portfolio Activity\nAcquisitions\nWe acquired seven hotel properties in 2015 and six hotel properties in 2014. A summary of these acquisitions is as follows (dollars in thousands, except Cost per Key):\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> Date Acquired\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Franchise/Brand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>

operating partnership valued at the time of issuance at $3.7 million. As of December 31, 2015, 141,140 of the Common Units issued had been tendered for redemption and were redeemed for an equivalent number of shares of our common stock.\n(2) The amounts reflect actual total renovation costs.\n(3) The amounts reflect actual-to-date and estimated remaining costs to complete.\n(4) This hotel was a Parked Asset at December 31, 2015 until certain assets were sold to ARCH pursuant to the ARCH Sale on February 11, 2016, at which time legal title was transferred to us upon completion of a reverse 1031 Exchange. See Item 7. - \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Hotel Property Portfolio Activity - Other Hotel Property Investment Activities.\u201d\nOn January 19, 2016, we acquired the 226-guestroom Courtyard by Marriott in the West End of Nashville, TN for $71.0 million. On January 20, 2016, we acquired the 160-guestroom Residence Inn in midtown Atlanta, GA for $38.0 million. The acquisitions (collectively, the \u201cNoble Acquisition\u201d) were made using funds drawn on the Company's revolving line of credit. Both hotels were parked with a Qualified Intermediary in anticipation of completing reverse 1031 Exchanges. The reverse 1031 Exchange related to the Courtyard by Marriott in the West End of Nashville, TN was completed immediately after the closing of the sale of six hotel properties to ARCH on February 11, 2016.\nThe purchase price and renovation costs are funded by mortgage debt, advances on our senior unsecured revolving line of credit facility, cash and the issuance of Common Units in our operating partnership described in footnote 1 to the table above. Additional information about the mortgage debt financing is provided below in \u201cOutstanding Indebtedness - Mortgage Loans.\u201d\nOf the total renovation costs detailed in the table above, $11.9 million have been incurred as of December 31, 2015. There is no assurance that our actual renovation costs will not exceed our estimates.\nDispositions\nPursuant to our strategy to periodically evaluate our hotel properties and land held for development, we sold ten hotel properties in 2015 and four hotel properties and three parcels of land held for development in 2014. Historically, when a property was identified as being held for sale, we reclassified the property on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, evaluated for potential impairment and in the case of a hotel property, reported historical and future results of operations in discontinued operations.\nAs discussed in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) ASU No. 2014-08, \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity,\u201d was required to be adopted during the first quarter of 2015; however, we elected early adoption in the first quarter of 2014, which is permitted for disposals and classifications of assets as \u201cheld for sale\u201d provided that such assets had not been reported previously in discontinued operations. ASU No. 2014-08 changed the criteria for discontinued operations to include only disposals that represent a strategic shift in operations with a major effect on operations and results. As such, the results of operations for the AmericInn Hotel & Suites, Aspen Hotel & Suites and Hampton Inn in Fort Smith, AR were classified as discontinued operations until the sale of the properties during the year ended December 31, 2014. Under ASU 2014-08, the Company anticipates that the majority of future property sales will not be classified as discontinued operations.\nA summary of the dispositions in 2015 and 2014 follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> Disposition\nDate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Franchise/Brand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Gross Sales\nPrice\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2015:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Hampton Inn\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Medford, OR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> DoubleTree\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Baton Rouge, LA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fairfield Inn & Suites\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Baton Rouge, LA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Springhill Suites\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Baton Rouge, LA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> TownePlace Suites\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Baton Rouge, LA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Hampton Inn & Suites\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> El Paso, TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Hampton Inn\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fort Wayne, IN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Residence Inn\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fort Wayne, IN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Courtyard\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Flagstaff, AZ\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Springhill Suites\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Flagstaff, AZ\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 150,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2014:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> AmericInn Hotel & Suites and Aspen Hotel & Suites\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fort Smith, AR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,080\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Hampton Inn\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fort Smith, AR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,800\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Country Inn & Suites and adjacent land parcels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> San Antonio, TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,900\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The sale of these hotel properties included the assignment of the related ground leases.\n(2) The sale of this property included three adjacent land parcels totaling 5.64 acres.\nOther Hotel Property Investment Activities\nOn December 29, 2015, the Company and ARCH agreed to terminate the Real Estate Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of June 2, 2015 (as amended thereafter and as subsequently terminated, the \u201cTerminated Purchase Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which ARCH had the right to acquire fee simple interests in the ten hotels listed below containing a total of 996 guestrooms for an aggregate purchase price of $89.1 million at a closing that had been scheduled to occur on December 29, 2015. As a result of the termination, ARCH forfeited and we retained the $9.1 million earnest money deposit made under the Terminated Purchase Agreement and the parties were released from further obligations under the Terminated Purchase Agreement, except those which expressly survive the termination of the Terminated Purchase Agreement pursuant to its terms. This transaction had not been structured as a 1031 Exchange. The receipt of the $9.1 million of forfeited earnest money was recorded as Other Income on our Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn June 2, 2015, we entered into two separate agreements, as amended on July 15, 2015 (collectively, the \u201cARCH Agreements\u201d), to sell a portfolio of 26 hotels containing an aggregate of 2,793 guestrooms to ARCH for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $347.4 million (the \u201cARCH Sale\u201d). The hotels were to be sold in three separate closings. The first closing of ten hotels containing 1,090 guestrooms was completed on October 15, 2015 for an aggregate cash payment of $150.1 million.\nOn December 29, 2015, we and ARCH agreed to terminate the ARCH Agreements with respect to ARCH's right to acquire fee simple interests in ten hotels containing a total of 996 guestrooms for an aggregate purchase price of $89.1 million at a closing that had been scheduled to occur on December 29, 2015 (the \u201cTerminated Purchase Agreement\u201d). As a result of the termination, ARCH forfeited and we retained, the $9.1 million earnest money deposit made by ARCH under the ARCH Agreements related to the sale of these ten hotels and the parties were released from further obligations, except those which expressly survive the termination of the ARCH Agreements pursuant to its terms. This transaction had not been structured as a 1031 Exchange. The receipt of the $9.1 million of forfeited earnest money was recorded as Other Income on our Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn February 11, 2016, the Company and American Realty Capital Hospitality Portfolio SMT ALT, LLC, an affiliate of ARCH, as substitute purchaser (\u201cNew ARCH Purchaser\u201d), entered into a letter agreement (the \u201cReinstatement Agreement\u201d) and agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of the Reinstatement Agreement, to reinstate the Terminated Purchase Agreement in its entirety, except as modified by the Reinstatement Agreement (the Terminated Purchase Agreement, as reinstated and modified by the Reinstatement Agreement, is referred to herein as the \u201cReinstated Purchase Agreement\u201d), to make null and void the prior termination of the Terminated Purchase Agreement and to proceed with the proposed sale of the ten hotels listed below (the \u201cReinstated Hotels\u201d) pursuant to the Reinstated Purchase Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $89.1 million. The Reinstated Hotels are being sold to the New ARCH Purchaser as part of the ARCH Sale. As stated above, we previously sold ten of the 26 hotels to ARCH at a closing that occurred on October 15, 2015 for a purchase price of $150.1 million. As disclosed below, we sold six of the 26 hotels to an ARCH affiliated purchaser at a closing that occurred on February 11, 2016 for a purchase price of $108.3 million. The 16 hotels previously sold to ARCH affiliated purchasers were sold by us pursuant to a separate real estate purchase and sale agreement relating to the sale of those hotels.\nThe Reinstated Hotels are as follows:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> LOCATION\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ROOMS\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residence Inn - Jackson, MS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Holiday Inn Express - Vernon Hills, IL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Courtyard by Marriott - Germantown, TN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Courtyard by Marriott - Jackson, MS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fairfield Inn & Suites - Germantown, TN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residence Inn - Germantown, TN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aloft - Jacksonville, FL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Staybridge Suites - Ridgeland, MS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Homewood Suites - Ridgeland, MS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Courtyard by Marriott - El Paso, TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Reinstatement Agreement requires the New ARCH Purchaser to deposit non-refundable earnest money in the amount of $7.5 million (the \u201cNew Deposit\u201d) with an escrow agent to support the closing of the Reinstated Hotels. The New Deposit is non-refundable to the New ARCH Purchaser except in limited circumstances. The prior earnest money deposit in the amount of $9.1 million was retained by us in connection with the termination of the Terminated Purchase Agreement and will not be credited to the New ARCH Purchaser against the purchase price for the Reinstated Hotels. The closing of the sale of the Reinstated Hotels is scheduled to occur on or before December 30, 2016 (the \u201cNew Closing Date\u201d), or at such later date as the closing may be adjourned or extended in accordance with the express terms of the Reinstatement Agreement. If the closing of the Reinstated Hotels does not occur as required by the Reinstatement Agreement because of a default by the New ARCH Purchaser, then the New ARCH Purchaser will forfeit the New Deposit to us as liquidated damages.\nPrior to the New Closing Date, we have the right to continue to market and ultimately sell, without the consent of the New ARCH Purchaser, any or all of the Reinstated Hotels to a bona fide third-party purchaser that is not an affiliate of ours. If we sell some, but not all, of the Reinstated Hotels to a bona fide third-party purchaser, then the purchase price to be paid by the New ARCH Purchaser for the remaining Reinstated Hotels will be reduced accordingly (the \u201cRevised Purchase Price\u201d), but the New Deposit will remain with the escrow agent except in limited circumstances.\nOn February 11, 2016, we completed the sale of the following six hotels as part of the ARCH Sale:\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> LOCATION\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ROOMS\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fairfield Inn & Suites - Spokane, WA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fairfield Inn & Suites - Denver, CO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SpringHill Suites - Denver, CO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hampton Inn - Fort Collins, CO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fairfield Inn & Suites - Bellevue, WA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hilton Garden Inn - Fort Collins, CO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe six hotels were sold to ARCH for an aggregate purchase price of $108.3 million, and proceeds from the sale of the six hotels were used to complete certain reverse 1031 Exchanges. The hotels acquired by us for the reverse 1031 Exchanges included the 179-guestroom Courtyard by Marriott\u00ae in Atlanta (Decatur), GA on October 20, 2015 for a purchase price of $44.0 million and the 226-guestroom Courtyard by Marriott\u00ae in the West End of Nashville, TN for a purchase price of $71.0 million on January 19, 2016. The completion of the reverse 1031 Exchanges resulted in the deferral of taxable gains of approximately $74.0 million and the pay-down of our unsecured revolving credit facility by $105.0 million, resulting in additional borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving credit facility. Additionally, we repaid a mortgage loan totaling $5.8 million related to sale of the Springhill Suites in Denver, CO to ARCH.\nOn February 11, 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into a loan agreement with ARCH, as borrower, which provides for a loan by the Operating Partnership to ARCH in the amount of $27.5 million (the \u201cLoan\u201d). The proceeds of the Loan were required to be applied by ARCH as follows: (i) $20.0 million was applied toward the payment of a portion of the $108.3 million purchase price for the six hotels containing 707 guestrooms, which were acquired by an ARCH affiliated purchaser on February 11, 2016 as part of the ARCH Sale; and (ii) the remaining $7.5 million was applied by ARCH to fund the New Deposit under the Reinstated Purchase Agreement.\nThe entire principal amount of the Loan, and any accrued and unpaid interest, will be due and payable on February 11, 2017 (the \u201cMaturity Date\u201d), unless extended pursuant to the Loan agreement. ARCH will repay a portion of the outstanding principal balance of the Loan in an aggregate amount equal to $5.0 million, to be paid in five equal installments of $1.0 million, on the last day of May, June, July, August and September 2016 (the \u201cAmortization Payments\u201d). The Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time by ARCH, without payment of any penalty or premium. ARCH may extend the maturity date of the Loan under certain conditions by up to two years pursuant to two one-year extension options (each an \u201cExtension Option\u201d).\nInterest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the Loan at a rate of 13.0% per annum from the date of the Loan to the initial Maturity Date, 14.0% per annum during the first extension period and 15.0% per annum during the second extension period. An amount equal to 9.0% per annum is to be paid monthly. The remaining 4.0%, 5.0% and 6.0%, as the case may be, will accrue and be compounded monthly (the \u201cPIK\u201d). The PIK must be paid in order to exercise any Extension Option, otherwise the PIK is payable at the initial Maturity Date. The PIK may be paid in cash prior to the initial Maturity Date, or any extension thereof.\nTo secure the payment of the Amortization Payments, ARCH will cause the rents from certain hotel properties or assets of its taxable REIT subsidiaries to be deposited to a separate controlled account (the \u201cControl Account\u201d) and ARCH has granted the Operating Partnership a continuing security interest in all of its right, title and interest in and to the Control Account until the Amortization Payments have been satisfied in full in accordance with the terms of the Loan agreement.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe consider funds from operations (\u201cFFO\u201d) and EBITDA, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures, to be useful to investors as key supplemental measures of our operating performance. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of FFO and EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, since not all companies calculate these non-GAAP measures in the same manner. FFO and EBITDA should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income (loss) as a measure of our operating performance. FFO and EBITDA may include funds that may not be available for our discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures, property acquisitions, debt service obligations and other commitments and uncertainties. Although we believe that FFO and EBITDA can enhance the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily better indicators of any trend as compared to a comparable GAAP measure such as net income (loss).\nFunds From Operations\nAs defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, (\u201cNAREIT\u201d), FFO represents net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding preferred dividends, gains (or losses) from sales of real property, impairment losses on real estate assets, items classified by GAAP as extraordinary, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Unless otherwise indicated, we present FFO applicable to our common shares and Common Units. We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operational performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization related to real estate assets, gains and losses from real property dispositions and impairment losses on real estate assets, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the effect to operations from trends in occupancy, guestroom rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. Our computation of FFO differs from the computation of NAREIT-defined FFO and may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO used by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs because in addition to the amount of depreciation and amortization we add back to net income or loss, we also add back the amortization of deferred financing costs and the amortization of franchise application fees. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions. Where indicated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, FFO is based on our computation of FFO and not the computation of NAREIT-defined FFO unless otherwise noted.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our GAAP net income to FFO for the years ended December 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except per share/unit data):\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 125,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Preferred dividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,588\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (16,588\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (14,590\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income applicable to common shares and common units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,693\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate-related depreciation (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on impairment of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on disposal of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (65,067\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (446\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (4,308\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-controlling interest in joint venture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (316\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments related to joint venture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (204\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (315\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NAREIT-defined FFO applicable to common shares and common units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 108,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of franchise application fees (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO applicable to common shares and common units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO per common share/common unit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average diluted common shares/common units (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 86,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes Common Units in the Operating Partnership held by limited partners (other than us and our subsidiaries) because the Common Units are redeemable for cash or, at our election, shares of our common stock.\n(2) The summation of these line items represents depreciation and amortization expense as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for each of the periods presented.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, FFO applicable to common shares and common units increased by $32.2 million, or 41.2%, over the prior year primarily due to an increase in revenues of $60.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 in comparison with the prior year, which resulted in an increase in net income (adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, loss on impairment of assets, equity-based compensation and gains on the disposal of assets) of $34.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 over the prior year. The increase in revenues was the result of increases in occupancy and ADR as discussed below under \u201cResults of Operations - Comparison of 2015 to 2014 - Revenues.\u201d Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, FFO increased because loss on impairment of assets declined $8.1 million in comparison with the prior year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, FFO applicable to common shares and common units increased by $29.7 million, or 61.2%, over the prior year primarily due to an increase in revenues of $104.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 in comparison with the prior year, which resulted in an increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $15.0 million over the prior year. The increase in revenues was the result of increases in occupancy and ADR as discussed below under \u201cResults of Operations - Comparison of 2014 to 2013 - Revenues.\u201d\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization\nEBITDA represents net income or loss, excluding: (i) interest, (ii) income tax expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt, to satisfy general operating expenses, to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs or reinvest cash into our business. We also believe it helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from our operating results. Our management also uses EBITDA as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our GAAP net income to EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 125,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (998\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (690\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (83\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-controlling interest in joint venture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (316\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments related to joint venture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (204\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (315\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 219,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 113,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 82,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, EBITDA increased by $106.2 million, or 94.0%, over the prior year primarily due to an increase in net income of $104.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 in comparison with the prior year. The increase in net income was primarily driven by an increase in revenues of $60.0 million and an increase in gain on disposal of assets of $64.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 in comparison with the prior year. The increase in revenues was the result of increases in occupancy and ADR as discussed below under \u201cResults of Operations - Comparison of 2015 to 2014 - Revenues.\u201d\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, EBITDA increased by $30.0 million, or 36.2%, over the prior year primarily due to an increase in net income of $27.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 in comparison with the prior year. The increase in net income was primarily driven by an increase in revenues of $104.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 in comparison with the prior year. The increase in revenues was the result of increases in occupancy and ADR as discussed below under \u201cResults of Operations - Comparison of 2014 to 2013 - Revenues.\u201d\nHotel Revenues and Operating Expenses\nOur revenues are derived from hotel operations and consist of room revenue and other hotel operations revenue. As a result of our focus on select-service hotels in the Upscale and Upper-midscale segments of the U.S. lodging industry, substantially all of our revenues are related to the sales of hotel guestrooms. Our other hotel operations revenue consists of ancillary revenues related to food and beverage sales, meeting rooms and other guest services provided at our hotel properties.\nOur hotel operating expenses consist primarily of expenses incurred in the day-to-day operation of our hotel properties. Many of our expenses are fixed, such as essential hotel staff, real estate taxes, insurance, depreciation and certain types of franchise fees, and these expenses do not decrease even if the revenues at our hotel properties decrease. Our hotel operating expenses consist of room expenses (wages, payroll taxes and benefits, linens, cleaning and guestroom supplies, and complimentary breakfast), other direct expenses (office supplies, utilities, telephone, advertising and bad debts), and other indirect expenses (real and personal property taxes, insurance, travel agent and credit card commissions, hotel management fees, and franchise fees).\nResults of Operations\nThe comparisons that follow should be reviewed in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Hotel properties classified as discontinued operations prior to our adoption of ASU 2014-08 are not included in the discussion below.\nComparison of 2015 to 2014\nThe following table contains key operating metrics for our total portfolio and our same-store portfolio for 2015 compared with 2014 (dollars in thousands, except ADR and RevPAR). We define same-store hotels as properties that we owned or leased as of December 31, 2015 and that we have owned or leased at all times since January 1, 2014.\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year-over-Year\nDollar\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year-over-Year\nPercentage/Basis Point\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Same-Store\nPortfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Same-Store\nPortfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Same-Store\nPortfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Same-Store\nPortfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (87 hotels)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (74 hotels)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (90 hotels)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (74 hotels)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (87/90 hotels)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (74 hotels)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (87/90 hotels)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (74 hotels)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 463,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 357,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 403,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 330,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hotel operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 295,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 231,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 261,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 215,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 7.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 76.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 75.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 75.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> bps\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ADR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 132.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 128.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 121.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RevPAR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 102.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 98.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 92.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 91.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 8.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe total portfolio information above includes revenues and expenses from the seven hotels we acquired in 2015 (the \u201c2015 Acquired Hotels\u201d) and the six hotel properties we acquired in 2014 (the \u201c2014 Acquired Hotels\u201d) from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2015, and operating information (occupancy, ADR, and RevPAR) for the period each hotel was owned. Accordingly, the information does not reflect a full twelve months of operations in 2015 for the 2015 Acquired Hotels or a full twelve months of operations in 2014 for the 2014 Acquired Hotels. The combined 2015 Acquired Hotels and 2014 Acquired Hotels are referred to as the \u201c2015/2014 Acquired Hotels.\u201d\nRevenues. Total revenues increased $60.0 million, or 14.9%, to $463.5 million in 2015, compared with $403.5 million in 2014. The growth was due to a $27.3 million increase in same-store revenues and an $39.0 million increase in revenues at the 2015/2014 Acquired Hotels.\nThe same-store revenue increase of 8.3%, to $357.7 million in 2015 compared with $330.4 million in 2014, was due to a 160 basis point increase in same-store occupancy in 2015 compared with 2014, and a 6.0% increase in same-store ADR in 2015 compared with 2014. The increases in same-store occupancy and same-store ADR resulted in an 8.2% increase in same-store RevPAR to $98.77 in 2015 compared with $91.28 in 2014. These increases were due to the transformation of our portfolio by selling assets, including ten hotels in 2015 and four hotels in 2014, with lower operating margins and RevPAR growth opportunities and purchasing assets with higher operating margins and RevPAR growth opportunities, the improving economy, our strong revenue and asset management programs, hotel industry fundamentals and strategic and brand-required renovations made at our same-store hotel properties.\nHotel Operating Expenses. Hotel operating expenses for the total portfolio increased $34.3 million, or 13.1%, in 2015 compared with 2014. This increase is due in part to a $23.5 million increase in hotel operating expenses related to the 2015/2014 Acquired Hotels. In addition, the increase in hotel operating expenses in 2015 for the total portfolio was driven by a $15.6 million increase in same-store hotel operating expenses due to variable costs related to the $27.3 million, or 8.3%, increase in same-store revenue. Operating Margins for the same-store portfolio improved in 2015 compared to 2014, with same-store hotel operating expenses declining as a percentage of same-store revenue from 65.2% in 2014 to 64.6% in 2015, due to consistent fixed expenses and increasing revenues at the same-store hotel properties in 2015.\nThe following table summarizes our hotel operating expenses for our same-store (74 hotels) portfolio for 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rooms expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 84,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 24.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 25.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other direct expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other indirect expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 94,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 26.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 25.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total hotel operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 231,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 215,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 64.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 65.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.3 million, or 0.5%, to $64.1 million in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to depreciation associated with the 2015/2014 Acquired Hotels offset by the effect of the reclassification of 26 hotel properties to Assets Held for Sale resulting in depreciation expense no longer being recorded related to these assets in 2015. The 2015 depreciation and amortization expense includes $63.7 million of real estate-related depreciation and $0.4 million of franchise application fee amortization. The 2014 depreciation and amortization expense includes $63.3 million of real estate-related depreciation and $0.5 million of franchise application fee amortization.\nCorporate General and Administrative. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased by $1.3 million, or 6.6%, to $21.2 million in 2015 compared with 2014. This increase was primarily due to severance costs of $3.1 million, including non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of $1.1 million recognized upon the resignation of our former Executive Chairman of the Board on July 30, 2015. This increase was partially offset by a $1.0 million reduction in professional fees incurred in 2014 but not in 2015 related to the establishment of new procedures and systems for intercompany account reconciliations and $0.8 million in executive and board of directors recruiting fees recorded during 2014.\nLoss on impairment of assets. In 2015, we determined that the value of land parcels in San Antonio, TX, Fort Myers, FL and Flagstaff, AZ were impaired based on market conditions. As such, we recognized a loss on impairment of assets of $1.1 million in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized a loss on impairment of assets of $8.2 million related to the Country Inn & Suites and three adjacent land parcels totaling 5.64 acres in San Antonio, TX, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2014, and a loss on impairment of $0.7 million related to a land parcel in Spokane, WA.\nIn addition, in 2014, we recognized a loss on impairment of assets of $0.4 million related to the Hampton Inn in Fort Smith, AR. This property was classified as held for sale prior to the Company's adoption of ASU No. 2014-08 and its operating results, including impairment charges, were included in discontinued operations.\nGain on Disposal of Assets. Gain on disposal of assets increased by $64.7 million to $65.1 million in 2015 compared with 2014. This increase was primarily due to the sale of ten properties to ARCH on October 15, 2015 for a gain of $66.6 million.\nOther Income/Expense. Other income increased $10.6 million, or 1,773%, to $11.1 million in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to the earnest money deposit of $9.1 million that was forfeited by ARCH in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of terminating the agreement to purchase ten hotel properties that was scheduled to close on December 29, 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense/Benefit. Our total income tax expense in 2015 was $0.5 million. Our income tax expense was minimal due in part to the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2015, we reduced our valuation allowance to zero as the company had sufficient positive evidence to conclude that a U.S. valuation allowance is no longer needed on its net deferred tax assets. The positive evidence weighed included two consecutive years of profitability. The release of the valuation allowance resulted in a noncash deferred tax benefit of $0.1 million.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had valuation allowance of $2.4 million to offset deferred tax assets based on our assessment of realizability.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the utilization of tax attributes to offset taxable income reduced the overall amount of deferred tax assets subject to the valuation allowance. At December 31, 2015, we had gross deferred tax assets of $1.5 million primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards and $1.3 million in deferred tax liabilities related to an investment in a joint venture. We have concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and therefore, we reduced our valuation allowance to zero at December 31, 2015.\nComparison of 2014 to 2013\nThe following table contains key operating metrics for our total portfolio and our same-store portfolio for 2014 compared with 2013 (dollars in thousands, except ADR and RevPAR).

Accordingly, the information does not reflect a full twelve months of operations in 2014 for the 2014 Acquired Hotels or a full twelve months of operations in 2013 for the 2013 Acquired Hotels. The combined 2014 Acquired Hotels and 2013 Acquired Hotels are referred to as the \u201c2014/2013 Acquired Hotels.\u201d\nRevenues. Total revenues increased $104.5 million, or 35.0%, to $403.5 million in 2014, compared with $299.0 million in 2013. The growth was due to a $21.1 million increase in same-store revenues and an $83.7 million increase in revenues at the 2014/2013 Acquired Hotels.\nThe same-store revenue increase of 9.6%, to $240.6 million in 2014 compared with $219.5 million in 2013, was due to a 220 basis point increase in same-store occupancy in 2014 compared with 2013, and a 6.4% increase in same-store ADR in 2014 compared with 2013. The increases in same-store occupancy and same-store ADR resulted in a 9.7% increase in same-store RevPAR to $84.42 in 2014 compared with $76.98 in 2013. These increases were due to the improving economy, our strong revenue and asset management programs, hotel industry fundamentals and strategic and brand-required renovations made at our hotel properties.\nHotel Operating Expenses. Hotel operating expenses for the total portfolio increased $63.2 million, or 31.8%, in 2014 compared with 2013. This increase is due in part to a $51.8 million increase in hotel operating expenses related to the 2014/2013 Acquired Hotels. In addition, the increase in same-store hotel operating expenses in 2014 was driven by an $11.7 million increase in variable costs related to the $21.1 million, or 9.6%, increase in same-store revenue. Expenses at the same-store hotels declined as a percentage of same-store revenue from 67.1% in 2013 to 66.1% in 2014, due to consistent fixed expenses and increasing revenues at the same-store hotel properties in 2014.\nThe following table summarizes our hotel operating expenses for our same-store (65 hotels) portfolio for 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rooms expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 62,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 26.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 27.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other direct expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 13.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 13.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other indirect expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 26.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 26.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total hotel operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 159,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 147,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 66.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 67.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $14.4 million, or 29.3%, to $63.8 million in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to depreciation associated with the 2014/2013 Acquired Hotels and increased amortization of capitalized renovation costs at existing hotel properties. The 2014 depreciation and amortization expense includes $63.3 million of real estate-related depreciation and $0.5 million of franchise application fee amortization. The 2013 depreciation and amortization expense includes $48.9 million of real estate-related depreciation and $0.4 million of franchise application fee amortization.\nCorporate General and Administrative. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased by $7.0 million, or 53.4%, to $19.9 million in 2014 compared with 2013. The increase is primarily due to an increase in equity-based compensation of $1.4 million, an increase in salaries and bonus expense of $2.7 million and increased professional fees of $2.6 million related to internal controls improvements and other matters.\nOther Income/Expense. Other expense, net increased $4.3 million, or 19.6%, in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to an increase in interest expense due to higher average debt outstanding. This increase was slightly offset by a reduction in debt transaction costs and an increase in interest income.\nIncome Tax Expense/Benefit. Our total income tax expense (related to continuing operations and discontinued operations) in 2014 was $0.7 million. Our tax expense was minimal due to a valuation allowance against substantially all our deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2014, we had valuation allowance of $2.4 million, to reflect the deferred tax asset at the amount that is more-likely-than-not realized. The deferred tax assets primarily related to TRS net operating loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires judgement in assessing the likelihood of realization, and weighing of both positive and negative evidence. In our prior assessment, we heavily weighed the following negative evidence: i) a lack of history of consistent operational profitability, and ii) the Company's operation in a highly cyclical industry. Our total income tax expense (related to continuing operations and discontinued operations) in 2013 of $4.4 million is primarily due to our establishment of a valuation allowance related to net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) incurred by our TRS in 2011, 2012 and 2013.\nDiscontinued Operations\nPursuant to our strategy, we periodically evaluate our hotel properties for potential sale and redeployment of capital. When a hotel property was sold or identified as being held for sale, we reported its historical and future results of operations, including impairment charges, in discontinued operations until we adopted ASU 2014-08 in the first quarter of 2014.\nDiscontinued operations include the following hotel properties that have been sold:\n\u00b7 AmericInn Hotel & Suites in Golden, CO - sold January 2013;\n\u00b7 Hampton Inn in Denver, CO - sold February 2013;\n\u00b7 Holiday Inn and Holiday Inn Express in Boise, ID - sold May 2013;\n\u00b7 Courtyard by Marriott in Memphis, TN - sold May 2013;\n\u00b7 SpringHill Suites in Lithia Springs, GA - sold August 2013;\n\u00b7 Fairfield Inn in Lewisville, TX - sold August 2013;\n\u00b7 Fairfield Inn in Lakewood, CO - sold September 2013;\n\u00b7 Fairfield Inn in Emporia, KS - sold October 2013;\n\u00b7 SpringHill Suites in Little Rock, AR - sold November 2013;\n\u00b7 Fairfield Inn and AmericInn Hotel & Suites in Salina, KS - sold November 2013;\n\u00b7 Hampton Inn and Fairfield Inn & Suites in Boise, ID - sold November 2013;\n\u00b7 Holiday Inn Express in Emporia, KS - sold December 2013;\n\u00b7 AmericInn Hotel & Suites and Aspen Hotel & Suites in Fort Smith, AR - sold on January 17, 2014; and\n\u00b7 Hampton Inn in Fort Smith, AR - sold on September 9, 2014.\nA summary of results from our hotel properties included in discontinued operations follows (in thousands):\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hotel operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on impairment of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,036\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (174\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on disposal of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) before taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,265\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (728\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our hotel properties, recurring maintenance and capital expenditures necessary to maintain our hotel properties in accordance with internal and brand standards, capital expenditures to improve our hotel properties, acquisitions, interest expense, settlement of interest swaps, scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, restricted cash funding obligations and distributions to our stockholders.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of the costs of acquiring additional hotel properties, renovations and other non-recurring capital expenditures that periodically are made with respect to our hotel properties and scheduled debt payments, including maturing loans. On January 15, 2016, the Company entered into a new $450 million senior unsecured credit facility that replaced the former $300 million senior unsecured credit facility. The new credit facility extended the maturity date of the revolving line of credit under the former credit facility from 2017 to 2020 and the maturity date of the term loan component under the former credit facility from 2018 to 2021. See \u201cOutstanding Indebtedness\u201d below for further information.\nTo satisfy the requirements for qualification as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gains. We intend to distribute a sufficient amount of our taxable income to maintain our status as a REIT and to avoid tax on undistributed income. Therefore, if sufficient funds are not available to us from hotel dispositions, our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and additional mortgage and other loans, we will need to raise capital to grow our business and invest in additional hotel properties.\nWe expect to satisfy our liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations, working capital, short-term borrowings under our $450 million senior unsecured credit facility, term debt, repayment of notes receivable, the strategic sale of hotels and the release of restricted cash upon satisfaction of the usage requirements. In addition, we may fund the purchase price of hotel acquisitions and cost of required capital improvements by borrowing under our senior unsecured credit facility, assuming existing mortgage debt, issuing securities (including Common Units issued by our operating partnership), or incurring mortgage or other types of debt. Further, we may seek to meet our liquidity requirements by raising capital through public or private offerings of our equity or debt securities. However, certain factors may have an adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered hotel properties, borrowing restrictions imposed by lenders, volatility in the equity and debt capital markets and other market conditions. We will continue to analyze which sources of capital are most advantageous to us at any particular point in time, but financing may not be consistently available to us on terms that are attractive, or at all. We believe that our cash provided by operations, working capital, borrowings available under our $450 million senior unsecured credit facility and other sources of funds available to us will be sufficient to meet our ongoing liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $35.7 million of mortgage debt that matures in 2016. We have scheduled principal debt payments in 2016 totaling $44.2 million. Although we believe we will have the capacity to satisfy these debt maturities and pay these scheduled principal debt payments or that we will be able to fund them using draws under our $450 million senior unsecured credit facility, there can be no assurances that our credit facility will be available to repay such amortizing debt as draws under our credit facility are subject to certain financial covenants.\nWe anticipate making renovations and other non-recurring capital expenditures with respect to our hotel properties pursuant to property improvement plans required by our franchisors and our internal quality standards. We expect 2016 capital expenditures for these activities at hotel properties we own as of February 19, 2016 to be in the range of $40.0 million to $50.0 million. Actual amounts may differ from our expectations. We may also make renovations and incur other non-recurring capital expenditures in 2016 at hotel properties we acquire in the future.\nCash Flow Analysis\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities of $30.1 million from 2014 to 2015 primarily resulted from an increase in net income of $34.7 million, after adjusting for non-cash items.\nThe $69.4 million reduction in net cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared with 2014 resulted from an increase in proceeds from asset dispositions of $130.8 million partially offset by an increase in hotel property acquisitions of $58.7 million.\nThe $100.6 million decrease in net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities in 2015 compared with 2014 resulted primarily from a reduction in net borrowings of $97.5 million.\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities of $29.7 million from 2013 to 2014 primarily resulted from an increase in net income of $28.6 million, after adjusting for non-cash items. Additionally, prepaid expenses decreased by $3.6 million during 2014 compared to an increase of $3.7 million during 2013 as a result of lower acquisition activity during 2014, which resulted in lower escrow balances related to the acquisition of properties during the period. Partially offsetting these increases were changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses, which increased by $1.1 million during 2014 compared with a $9.3 million increase in 2013 due to the timing of vendor payments.\nThe $266.9 million reduction in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 compared with 2013 resulted from a decrease in hotel property acquisitions of $263.8 million and a $38.6 million change in restricted cash due to net cash reserves of $16.3 million being released in 2014. These changes were partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from asset dispositions of $33.6 million.\nThe $337.4 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2014 compared with 2013 resulted from a reduction in borrowings of $338.6 million, a reduction in proceeds from equity offerings of $381.8 million, a reduction in proceeds from joint venture partners of $7.5 million and an increase in dividends paid of $9.0 million. These changes were partially offset by a reduction in principal payments on debt of $397.0 million.\nOutstanding Indebtedness\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $367.1 million in outstanding indebtedness secured by first priority mortgage liens on 38 hotel properties. We also had $170.0 million borrowed on our former $300 million senior unsecured credit facility and $140.0 million borrowed on our 2015 Term Loan (defined below), both of which were supported at December 31, 2015 by a borrowing base comprised of 47 unencumbered hotel properties. On January 15, 2016, our former $300 million senior unsecured credit facility was replaced by a new $450 million senior unsecured credit facility and the hotels that supported the former $300 million senior unsecured credit facility were transitioned to support the borrowing base under our new $450 million senior unsecured credit facility. The hotel properties in the borrowing base must remain unencumbered by mortgage debt. Of the 47 unencumbered hotels, five were sold to ARCH on February 11, 2016. As such, these hotels are no longer available for inclusion in the borrowing base supporting the $450 million senior unsecured credit facility and the 2015 Term Loan and are expected to be replaced by unencumbered properties acquired through 1031 Exchanges related to the ARCH Sale and other hotels that become unencumbered due to the repayment of outstanding mortgage debt.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had two hotel properties with a total of 329 guestrooms unencumbered by mortgage debt that are available to be used as collateral for future loans.\nWe intend to secure or assume term loan financing or use our senior unsecured credit facility, together with other sources of financing, to fund future acquisitions and capital improvements. We may not succeed in obtaining new financing on favorable terms, or at all, and we cannot predict the size or terms of future financings. Our failure to obtain new financing could adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nWe intend to maintain a prudent capital structure and, while the ratio will vary from time to time, we generally intend to limit our ratio of indebtedness to EBITDA to no more than six to one. For purposes of calculating this ratio, we exclude preferred stock from indebtedness. We have obtained financing through debt instruments having staggered maturities and intend to continue to do so in the future. Our debt includes, and may include in the future, debt secured by first priority mortgage liens on certain hotel properties and unsecured debt.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the covenants under our debt agreements. We do not currently anticipate any change in circumstances that would impair our ability to continue to comply with these covenants.\nWe believe we will have adequate liquidity to meet requirements for scheduled maturities and principal repayments. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due and, if refinanced, whether such refinancing will be available on favorable terms.\nA summary

mortgage loans are cross-collateralized, and the four mortgage loans are cross-defaulted.\n(4) The Bank of Cascades mortgage loans are cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted.\nFormer $300 Million Senior Unsecured Credit Facility\nAt December 31, 2015, we had a $300.0 million senior unsecured credit facility. The senior unsecured credit facility was comprised of a $225.0 million revolving credit facility (the \u201c$225 Million Revolver\u201d) and a $75.0 million term loan (the \u201c$75 Million Term Loan\u201d). At December 31, 2015, the maximum amount of borrowing permitted under the senior unsecured credit facility was $300.0 million, of which we had $170.0 million borrowed and $130.0 million available to borrow.\n$450 Million Senior Unsecured Credit Facility\nOn January 15, 2016, the Operating Partnership, as borrower, the Company, as parent guarantor, and each party executing the loan documentation as a subsidiary guarantor, entered into a $450 million senior unsecured facility (the \u201c2016 Unsecured Credit Facility\u201d) with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, and Regions Capital Markets as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, and a syndicate of lenders including Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Bank of America, N.A., Regions Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, U.S. Bank National Association, PNC Bank, National Association, KeyBank National Association, Raymond James Bank, N.A., and Branch Banking and Trust Company.\nThe 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility is comprised of a $300 million revolving credit facility (the \u201c$300 Million Revolver\u201d) and a $150 million term loan (the \u201c$150 Million Term Loan\u201d) and replaces the former $300 million unsecured credit facility. The 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility has an accordion feature which will allow the Company to increase the total commitments by an aggregate of up to $150 million on the $300 Million Revolver and $150 Million Term Loan. The $300 Million Revolver will mature on March 31, 2020 and can be extended to March 31, 2021 at the Company's option, subject to certain conditions. The $150 Million Term Loan will mature on March 31, 2021.\nOutstanding borrowings on the 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility are limited to the least of (1) the aggregate commitments of all of the lenders, (2) the aggregate value of the unencumbered assets, multiplied by 60%, less the consolidated unsecured indebtedness of the Company (exclusive of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility), all as calculated pursuant to the terms of the 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility agreement, and (3) the principal amount that when drawn under the 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility would result in an unsecured interest expense, calculated on a pro forma basis for the next consecutive four fiscal quarters of the Company after taking such draws into account, equal to 50% of the net operating income of the unencumbered assets, as adjusted pursuant to the 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility agreement. A minimum of 20 of the Company's hotel properties must qualify as unencumbered assets, as defined in the 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility agreement, or the aggregate value of the unencumbered assets will be deemed to be zero.\nPayment Terms. The Company is obligated to pay interest at the end of each selected interest period, but not less than quarterly, with all outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest due at the maturity of the respective facility. The Company has the right to repay all or any portion of the outstanding borrowings from time to time without penalty or premium, other than customary early payment fees if the Company repays a LIBOR loan before the end of the contract period. In addition, the Company will be required to make earlier principal reduction payments in the event of certain changes in the unencumbered asset availability.\nThe Company pays interest on revolving credit advances at varying rates based upon, at the Company's option, either (i) 1, 2, 3, or 6-month LIBOR, plus a LIBOR margin between 1.50% and 2.25%, depending upon the Company's leverage ratio (as defined in the 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility agreement), or (ii) the applicable base rate, which is the greatest of the administrative agent's prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, and 1-month LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus a base rate margin between 0.50% and 1.25%, depending upon the Company's leverage ratio. The applicable margin for a term loan advance shall be 0.05% less than the revolving credit advances referenced above. In addition, on a quarterly basis, the Company will be required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility equal to the unused amount multiplied by an annual rate of either (i) 0.25%, if the unused amount is greater than 50% of the maximum aggregate amount of the 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility, or (ii) 0.20%, if the unused amount is equal to or less than 50% of the maximum aggregate amount of the 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility. The Company will also be required to pay other fees, including customary arrangement and administrative fees.\nFinancial and Other Covenants. We are required to comply with a series of financial and other covenants in order to borrow under this credit facility. The material financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum consolidated tangible net worth, a maximum dividend payout ratio, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum ratio of secured indebtedness to total asset value, a maximum ratio of secured recourse indebtedness to total asset value, a maximum ratio of consolidated unsecured indebtedness to total unencumbered asset value, and a maximum ratio of unencumbered adjusted net operating income to assumed unsecured interest expense.\nWe are also subject to other customary covenants, including restrictions on investment, limitations on liens and maintenance of properties. This credit facility also contains customary events of default, including, among others, the failure to make payments when due under any of the credit facility documentation, breach of any covenant continuing beyond any cure period, and bankruptcy or insolvency.\nUnencumbered Assets. The 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility is unsecured. However, borrowings under the 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility are limited by the value of hotel assets that qualify as unencumbered assets. Among other conditions, unencumbered assets must not be subject to liens or security interests, and the owner and operating lessee of such unencumbered asset must execute a guaranty supplement pursuant to which the owner and operating lessee become subsidiary guarantors of the 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility. In addition, hotels may be added to or removed from the unencumbered asset pool at any time so long as there is a minimum of 20 hotels in the unencumbered asset pool and the then-current borrowings on the 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility do not exceed the maximum available under the 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility given the availability limitations described above. Further, to be eligible as an unencumbered asset, the anticipated property must: be franchised with a nationally-recognized franchisor; satisfy certain ownership, management and operating lessee criteria; and not be subject to material defects, such as liens, title defects, environmental contamination and other standard lender criteria.\nAt February 19, 2016, 42 of our unencumbered hotel properties are included in the borrowing base supporting the 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility. Thus, none of these properties is available to be leveraged with other indebtedness while included in the borrowing base.\nThe Company transferred to the 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility the outstanding principal balance of $170.0 million on the former $300 million senior unsecured credit facility, and the former $300 million senior unsecured credit facility was paid off in full and terminated upon entry into the 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility described above.\nThe interest rate swap entered into on September 5, 2013 with a notional value of $75.0 million, an effective date of January 2, 2014 and a maturity date of October 10, 2018 remains outstanding. This interest rate swap was designated as a cash flow hedge and effectively fixes LIBOR at 2.04% and the interest rate on borrowings under a portion of the $150 Million Term Loan to a fixed rate of 3.64%.\n2015 Unsecured Term Loan\nOn April 7, 2015, our operating partnership, as borrower, the Company, as parent guarantor, and each party executing the term loan documentation as a subsidiary guarantor, entered into a $125.0 million unsecured term loan with KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent, Regions Bank and Raymond James Bank, N.A., as co-syndication agents, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc., Regions Capital Markets and Raymond James Bank, N.A., as co-lead arrangers, and a syndicate of lenders including KeyBank National Association, Regions Bank, Raymond James Bank, N.A., Branch Banking and Trust Company, and U.S. Bank National Association (the \u201c2015 Term Loan\u201d).\nThe 2015 Term Loan matures on April 7, 2022 and has an accordion feature which allowed us to increase the total commitments by an aggregate of $75.0 million prior to the maturity date, subject to certain conditions. On April 21, 2015, the Company exercised $15.0 million of the accordion and added American Bank, N.A. as a lender under the facility.\nOutstanding borrowings on the 2015 Term Loan are limited by certain measures related to consolidated unsecured indebtedness of the Company, unencumbered adjusted net operating income, and the aggregate value of the unencumbered assets. In addition, we are subject to certain financial and other covenants. Borrowings under the 2015 Term Loan are limited by the value of hotel assets that qualify as unencumbered assets. As of December 31, 2015, 47 of our hotel properties qualified as, and are deemed to be, unencumbered assets.\nAt February 19, 2016, 42 of our unencumbered hotel properties are included in the borrowing base supporting the 2015 Term Loan. Thus, none of these properties is available to be leveraged with other indebtedness while included in the borrowing base.\nWe are obligated to pay interest at the end of each selected interest period, but not less than quarterly, with all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest due at the maturity of the loan. We have the right to repay all or any portion of the outstanding borrowings from time to time, subject to prepayment fees for the first two years of the term. We pay interest on advances equal to the sum of LIBOR or the administrative agent's prime rate and the applicable margin. We are currently paying interest at 2.38% based on LIBOR at December 31, 2015.\nThe 2015 Term Loan permits our operating partnership and the Company to maintain unsecured credit facilities with other lenders. Furthermore, the 2015 Term Loan permits us to use those assets included in the unencumbered asset pool as unencumbered assets for credit facilities with other lenders, provided that all financial and other covenants are maintained.\nAt closing we drew the full $125.0 million amount of the unsecured term loan and on April 21, 2015, we drew the $15.0 million exercised on the accordion. All proceeds were used to pay down the principal balance of our $225 Million Revolver provided under the former $300 million senior unsecured credit facility.\nMortgage Loans\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $367.1 million in mortgage loans. These loans are secured by first priority mortgage liens on hotel properties.\nAdditional information regarding our mortgage loans is included in our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nAt February 19, 2016, we had $359.8 million in outstanding indebtedness secured by first priority mortgage liens on 37 hotel properties. We also had $190.0 million borrowed on our 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility and $140.0 million borrowed on our 2015 Term Loan, both of which were supported by 42 hotel properties included in the credit facility borrowing bases. In addition, we have four other hotels with a total of 715 guestrooms unencumbered by mortgage debt that are available to be used as collateral for future loans.\nEquity Transactions\nOn August 3, 2015, the Company, our operating partnership and Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated (\u201cBaird\u201d) entered into a sales agreement (the \u201cSales Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell from time to time up to $125.0 million in shares of its common stock through Baird, acting as agent or principal. In connection with entering into the new sales agreement with Baird, the Company notified each sales agent under its prior $75 million \u201cat the market\u201d offering program (Baird, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., JMP Securities LLC, MLV & Co. LLC and RBC Capital Markets, LLC) of the Company's intent to terminate each of the sales agreements relating to the prior program. Through February 24, 2016, we have not sold any shares pursuant to the Sales Agreement.\nPursuant to the Sales Agreement, the shares may be offered and sold through Baird in transactions that are deemed to be \u201cat the market\u201d offerings as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on the NYSE or sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange or, with the prior consent of the Company, in privately negotiated transactions. Baird will be entitled to compensation equal to up to 2.0% of the gross proceeds of the shares sold through Baird from time to time under the Sales Agreement. The Company has no obligation to sell any of the shares under the Sales Agreement and may at any time suspend solicitations and offers under, or terminate, the Sales Agreement.\nCapital Expenditures\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we funded $43.2 million in capital expenditures. We anticipate spending an estimated $40.0 million to $50.0 million on hotel property renovations in 2016. We expect to fund these expenditures through a combination of cash provided by operations, working capital, borrowings under our 2016 Unsecured Credit Facility, or other potential sources of capital, to the extent available to us.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table outlines the timing of required payments related to our long-term debt and other contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due By Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\nOne Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> One to Three\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three to Five\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\nFive Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 839,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 69,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 248,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 92,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 429,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 112,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 106,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 957,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 75,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 250,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 94,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 536,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Amounts shown include amortization of principal, maturities, and estimated interest payments.

The closing of the Noble Acquisition occurred on January 19, 2016 and January 20, 2016 as described under Item 7. - \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Hotel Property Portfolio Activity - Acquisitions.\u201d\nInflation\nOperators of hotel properties, in general, possess the ability to adjust guestroom rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation on our operating expenses. However, competitive pressures may limit the ability of our management companies to raise guestroom rates and thus, we may not be able to offset increased expenses with an increase in revenues.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates:\nInvestment in Hotel Properties\nAcquisitions. We allocate the purchase price of acquired hotel properties based on the fair value of the acquired land, land improvements, building, furniture, fixtures and equipment, identifiable intangible assets or liabilities, other assets and assumed liabilities. Intangible assets may include certain value associated with the on-going operations of the hotel business being acquired as part of the hotel property acquisition. Acquired intangible assets that derive their values from real property or an interest in real property, are inseparable from that real property or interest in real property, and do not produce or contribute to the production of income other than consideration for the use or occupancy of space, are recorded as a component of the related real estate asset in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Identifiable intangible assets or liabilities may also arise from assumed contractual arrangements as part of the acquisition of the hotel property, including terms that are above or below market compared to an estimated fair market value of the agreement at the acquisition date. We determine the acquisition-date fair values of all assets and assumed liabilities using appraisals prepared by independent appraisers. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. Changes in estimates and judgments related to the allocation of the purchase price could result in adjustments to our investment in hotel properties or intangible assets, which can affect depreciation and/or amortization expense and our results of operations.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Hotel properties are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 25 to 40 years for buildings and two to 15 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment. We are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our assets for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation expense to reflect each year. While we believe our estimates are reasonable, a change in the estimated useful lives could affect our results of operations.\nImpairment of Hotel Properties. We monitor events and changes in circumstances for indicators that the carrying value of a hotel property or land held for development may be impaired. Additionally, we perform quarterly reviews to monitor the factors that could trigger an impairment. Factors that could trigger an impairment analysis include, among others: i) significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results, ii) significant changes in the manner of use of a property or the strategy of our overall business, iii) a significant increase in competition, iv) a significant adverse change in legal factors or regulations, and v) significant negative industry or economic trends. When such factors are identified, we prepare an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, without interest charges, of the specific property and determine if our investment is recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows. If impairment is indicated, we estimate the fair value of the property and an adjustment is made to reduce the carrying value of the property to fair value. These assessments may affect the results of our operations.\nIntangible Assets\nWe amortize intangible assets with determined finite useful lives using the straight-line method. We do not amortize intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, but we evaluate these assets for impairment annually or at interim periods if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe consolidate variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d) if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. When evaluating the accounting for a VIE, we consider the purpose for which the VIE was created, the importance of each of the activities in which it is engaged and our decision-making role, if any, in those activities that significantly determine the entity's economic performance relative to other economic interest holders. We determine our rights, if any, to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE by considering the economic interest in the entity, regardless of form, which may include debt, equity, management and servicing fees, or other contractual arrangements. We consider relevant factors of the entity's design including the entity's capital structure, contractual rights to earnings (losses), subordination of our interests relative to those of other investors, contingent payments, and other contractual arrangements that may be economically significant. Evaluating the accounting for a VIE requires the exercise of significant professional judgment.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are comprised of room revenue and other hotel operations revenue, which includes revenues from the sale of food and beverages and other ancillary amenities. We recognize revenues, net of any sales and occupancy taxes collected from guests, when guestrooms are occupied and services are rendered. All rebates and discounts are recorded as a reduction in revenue. Appropriate allowances are made for doubtful accounts and are recorded as bad debt expense. The allowances are calculated as a percentage of aged accounts receivable and take into consideration past collection history and specific customer information. Cash received prior to guest arrival is recorded as an advance from the customer and is recognized as revenue at the time of occupancy.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nOur Equity Plan and Amended Equity Plan provide for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, dividend equivalent rights and other stock-based awards. We account for equity-based compensation using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for stock options and the grant date fair value of our common stock for all other awards. Some of the awards we issue are performance or market-based awards and are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. We expense these awards over the vesting period. The amount of the expense may be subject to adjustment in future periods due to a change in forfeiture assumptions.\nIncome Taxes\nCommencing with our short taxable year ended December 31, 2011, we elected to be taxed as a REIT under certain provisions of the IRC. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax (other than taxes paid by our TRS) to the extent we currently distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will be unable to re-elect\nREIT status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we failed to quality as a REIT, unless we satisfy certain relief provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we intend to be organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT.\nWe account for federal and state income taxes of our TRS using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities based on GAAP and respective carrying amounts for tax purposes, and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In the event that these assumptions change, the deferred taxes may change.\nNew Accounting Standards Adopted\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08, \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.\u201d The ASU changed the criteria for reporting discontinued operations while enhancing related disclosures. Criteria for discontinued operations now include only disposals that represent a strategic shift in operations with a major effect on operations and financial results. ASU 2014-08 is to be applied on a prospective basis and had a required adoption date of January 1, 2015; however, we elected early adoption in the first quarter of 2014, which is permitted for disposals and classifications of assets as \u201cheld for sale,\u201d provided such assets had not been reported previously in discontinued operations.\nOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018 and early adoption is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, \u201cDisclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,\u201d which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. Certain disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern. This standard becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2017.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, \u201cConsolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,\u201d which changes the way reporting enterprises evaluate the consolidation of limited partnerships, variable interests and similar entities. This standard will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted. We do not anticipate that the adoption of ASU No. 2015-02 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or our consolidated results of operations.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, \u201cSimplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\u201d which requires debt issuance costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt liability. This standard is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted and will be applied on a retrospective basis. We do not anticipate that the adoption of ASU No. 2015-03 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or our consolidated results of operations.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, \u201cSimplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,\u201d which illustrates certain guidance governing adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. Such adjustments are required when new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement amounts initially recognized or would have resulted in the recognition of additional assets and liabilities. ASU No. 2015-16 eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for such adjustments. ASU No. 2015-16 is effective for our fiscal year commencing on January 1, 2016. We do not anticipate that the adoption of ASU No. 2015-16 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or our consolidated results of operations.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, \u201cBalance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,\u201d which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncurrent based on an analysis of each taxpaying component within a jurisdiction. ASU No. 2015-17 is effective for our fiscal year commencing on January 1, 2017.\nWe do not anticipate that the adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or our consolidated results of operations.\nRecent Developments\nEquity\nOn January 1, 2016, a total of 31,042 Common Units were tendered for redemption and were redeemed for an equivalent number of shares of our common stock.\nAcquisitions\nOn January 19, 2016, we acquired the 226 guestroom Courtyard by Marriott in the West End of Nashville, TN for $71.0 million. On January 20, 2016, we acquired the 160 guestroom Residence Inn in midtown Atlanta, GA for a purchase price of $38.0 million.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIndustry Trends and Outlook\nRoom-night demand in the U.S. lodging industry is generally correlated to macroeconomic trends. Key drivers of demand include growth in GDP, corporate profits, capital investments and employment. Although we remain optimistic that our hotel properties will realize RevPAR gains despite the recent volatility of the economy and lodging industry, the risk exists that global and domestic economic conditions may cause the economic growth to slow or stall, which likely would adversely affect our growth expectations.\nThe U.S. lodging industry experienced a positive trend through 2015 that we expect to continue through 2016. According to a report prepared in January 2016 by PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, U.S. RevPAR growth in 2015 for Upscale hotels and Upper-midscale hotels was 5.6% and 6.3%, respectively, while projected 2016 RevPar growth is 4.7% and 5.4% respectively. We continue to have a positive outlook about national macro-economic conditions and their effect on room-night demand; however, as occupancy levels stabilize, growth expectations for fiscal year 2016 are expected to decelerate from those experienced in 2015. While the supply of new hotels under construction has increased and is expected to accelerate in 2016, we expect that our operating results will not be adversely affected to a substantial degree by increased lodging supply in our markets.\nOperating Performance Metrics\nWe use a variety of operating performance indicators and other information to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of our business. These key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as other financial information that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, we use other information that may not be financial in nature, including statistical information and comparative data. We use this information to measure the performance of individual hotel properties, groups of hotel properties and/or our business as a whole. We periodically compare historical information to our internal budgets as well as industry-wide information. These key indicators include:\n\u00b7 Occupancy - Occupancy represents the total number of guestrooms occupied divided by the total number of guestrooms available.\n\u00b7 Average Daily Rate (ADR) - ADR represents total room revenues divided by the total number of guestrooms occupied.\n\u00b7 Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR) - RevPAR is the product of ADR and Occupancy.\nOccupancy, ADR and RevPAR are commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate operating performance. RevPAR is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel property level and across our business as a whole. We evaluate individual hotel RevPAR performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget and prior periods, as well as on a company-wide and regional basis. ADR and RevPAR include only room revenue. Room revenue depends on demand (as measured by occupancy), pricing (as measured by ADR), and our available supply of hotel guestrooms. Our ADR, occupancy and RevPAR performance may be affected by macroeconomic factors such as regional and local employment growth, personal income and corporate earnings, office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions, airport and other business and leisure travel, new hotel property construction, and the pricing strategies of competitors. In addition, our ADR, occupancy and RevPAR performance is dependent on the continued success of our franchisors and brands.\nHotel Property Portfolio Activity\nAcquisitions\nWe acquired seven hotel properties in 2015 and six hotel properties in 2014. A summary of these acquisitions is as follows (dollars in thousands, except Cost per Key):\n\n(1) The purchase price for this hotel included the issuance of 412,174 Common Units in our operating partnership valued at the time of issuance at $3.7 million. As of December 31, 2015, 141,140 of the Common Units issued had been tendered for redemption and were redeemed for an equivalent number of shares of our common stock.\n(2) The amounts reflect actual total renovation costs.\n(3) The amounts reflect actual-to-date and estimated remaining costs to complete.\n(4) This hotel was a Parked Asset at December 31, 2015 until certain assets were sold to ARCH pursuant to the ARCH Sale on February 11, 2016, at which time legal title was transferred to us upon completion of a reverse 1031 Exchange. See Item 7. - \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Hotel Property Portfolio Activity - Other Hotel Property Investment Activities.\u201d\nOn January 19, 2016, we acquired the 226-guestroom Courtyard by Marriott in the West End of Nashville, TN for $71.0 million. On January 20, 2016, we acquired the 160-guestroom Residence Inn in midtown Atlanta, GA for $38.0 million. The acquisitions (collectively, the \u201cNoble Acquisition\u201d) were made using funds drawn on the Company's revolving line of credit. Both hotels were parked with a Qualified Intermediary in anticipation of completing reverse 1031 Exchanges. The reverse 1031 Exchange related to the Courtyard by Marriott in the West End of Nashville, TN was completed immediately after the closing of the sale of six hotel properties to ARCH on February 11, 2016.\nThe purchase price and renovation costs are funded by mortgage debt, advances on our senior unsecured revolving line of credit facility, cash and the issuance of Common Units in our operating partnership described in footnote 1 to the table above. Additional information about the mortgage debt financing is provided below in \u201cOutstanding Indebtedness - Mortgage Loans.\u201d\nOf the total renovation costs detailed in the table above, $11.9 million have been incurred as of December 31, 2015. There is no assurance that our actual renovation costs will not exceed our estimates.\nDispositions\nPursuant to our strategy to periodically evaluate our hotel properties and land held for development, we sold ten hotel properties in 2015 and four hotel properties and three parcels of land held for development in 2014. Historically, when a property was identified as being held for sale, we reclassified the property on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, evaluated for potential impairment and in the case of a hotel property, reported historical and future results of operations in discontinued operations.\nAs discussed in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) ASU No. 2014-08, \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity,\u201d was required to be adopted during the first quarter of 2015; however, we elected early adoption in the first quarter of 2014, which is permitted for disposals and classifications of assets as \u201cheld for sale\u201d provided that such assets had not been reported previously in discontinued operations. ASU No. 2014-08 changed the criteria for discontinued operations to include only disposals that represent a strategic shift in operations with a major effect on operations and results. As such, the results of operations for the AmericInn Hotel & Suites, Aspen Hotel & Suites and Hampton Inn in Fort Smith, AR were classified as discontinued operations until the sale of the properties during the year ended December 31, 2014. Under ASU 2014-08, the Company anticipates that the majority of future property sales will not be classified as discontinued operations.\nA summary of the dispositions in 2015 and 2014 follows (dollars in thousands):\n\n(1) The sale of these hotel properties included the assignment of the related ground leases.\n(2) The sale of this property included three adjacent land parcels totaling 5.64 acres.\nOther Hotel Property Investment Activities\nOn December 29, 2015, the Company and ARCH agreed to terminate the Real Estate Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of June 2, 2015 (as amended thereafter and as subsequently terminated, the \u201cTerminated Purchase Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which ARCH had the right to acquire fee simple interests in the ten hotels listed below containing a total of 996 guestrooms for an aggregate purchase price of $89.1 million at a closing that had been scheduled to occur on December 29, 2015. As a result of the termination, ARCH forfeited and we retained the $9.1 million earnest money deposit made under the Terminated Purchase Agreement and the parties were released from further obligations under the Terminated Purchase Agreement, except those which expressly survive the termination of the Terminated Purchase Agreement pursuant to its terms. This transaction had not been structured as a 1031 Exchange. The receipt of the $9.1 million of forfeited earnest money was recorded as Other Income on our Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn June 2, 2015, we entered into two separate agreements, as amended on July 15, 2015 (collectively, the \u201cARCH Agreements\u201d), to sell a portfolio of 26 hotels containing an aggregate of 2,793 guestrooms to ARCH for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $347.4 million (the \u201cARCH Sale\u201d). The hotels were to be sold in three separate closings. The first closing of ten hotels containing 1,090 guestrooms was completed on October 15, 2015 for an aggregate cash payment of $150.1 million.\nOn December 29, 2015, we and ARCH agreed to terminate the ARCH Agreements with respect to ARCH's right to acquire fee simple interests in ten hotels containing a total of 996 guestrooms for an aggregate purchase price of $89.1 million at a closing that had been scheduled to occur on December 29, 2015 (the \u201cTerminated Purchase Agreement\u201d). As a result of the termination, ARCH forfeited and we retained, the $9.1 million earnest money deposit made by ARCH under the ARCH Agreements related to the sale of these ten hotels and the parties were released from further obligations, except those which expressly survive the termination of the ARCH Agreements pursuant to its terms. This transaction had not been structured as a 1031 Exchange. The receipt of the $9.1 million of forfeited earnest money was recorded as Other Income on our Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn February 11, 2016, the Company and American Realty Capital Hospitality Portfolio SMT ALT, LLC, an affiliate of ARCH, as substitute purchaser (\u201cNew ARCH Purchaser\u201d), entered into a letter agreement (the \u201cReinstatement Agreement\u201d) and agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of the Reinstatement Agreement, to reinstate the Terminated Purchase Agreement in its entirety, except as modified by the Reinstatement Agreement (the Terminated Purchase Agreement, as reinstated and modified by the Reinstatement Agreement, is referred to herein as the \u201cReinstated Purchase Agreement\u201d), to make null and void the prior termination of the Terminated Purchase Agreement and to proceed with the proposed sale of the ten hotels listed below (the \u201cReinstated Hotels\u201d) pursuant to the Reinstated Purchase Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $89.1 million. The Reinstated Hotels are being sold to the New ARCH Purchaser as part of the ARCH Sale. As stated above, we previously sold ten of the 26 hotels to ARCH at a closing that occurred on October 15, 2015 for a purchase price of $150.1 million. As disclosed below, we sold six of the 26 hotels to an ARCH affiliated purchaser at a closing that occurred on February 11, 2016 for a purchase price of $108.3 million. The 16 hotels previously sold to ARCH affiliated purchasers were sold by us pursuant to a separate real estate purchase and sale agreement relating to the sale of those hotels.\nThe Reinstated Hotels are as follows:\n\nThe Reinstatement Agreement requires the New ARCH Purchaser to deposit non-refundable earnest money in the amount of $7.5 million (the \u201cNew Deposit\u201d) with an escrow agent to support the closing of the Reinstated Hotels. The New Deposit is non-refundable to the New ARCH Purchaser except in limited circumstances. The prior earnest money deposit in the amount of $9.1 million was retained by us in connection with the termination of the Terminated Purchase Agreement and will not be credited to the New ARCH Purchaser against the purchase price for the Reinstated Hotels. The closing of the sale of the Reinstated Hotels is scheduled to occur on or before December 30, 2016 (the \u201cNew Closing Date\u201d), or at such later date as the closing may be adjourned or extended in accordance with the express terms of the Reinstatement Agreement. If the closing of the Reinstated Hotels does not occur as required by the Reinstatement Agreement because of a default by the New ARCH Purchaser, then the New ARCH Purchaser will forfeit the New Deposit to us as liquidated damages.\nPrior to the New Closing Date, we have the right to continue to market and ultimately sell, without the consent of the New ARCH Purchaser, any or all of the Reinstated Hotels to a bona fide third-party purchaser that is not an affiliate of ours. If we sell some, but not all, of the Reinstated Hotels to a bona fide third-party purchaser, then the purchase price to be paid by the New ARCH Purchaser for the remaining Reinstated Hotels will be reduced accordingly (the \u201cRevised Purchase Price\u201d), but the New Deposit will remain with the escrow agent except in limited circumstances.\nOn February 11, 2016, we completed the sale of the following six hotels as part of the ARCH Sale:\n\nThe six hotels were sold to ARCH for an aggregate purchase price of $108.3 million, and proceeds from the sale of the six hotels were used to complete certain reverse 1031 Exchanges. The hotels acquired by us for the reverse 1031 Exchanges included the 179-guestroom Courtyard by Marriott\u00ae in Atlanta (Decatur), GA on October 20, 2015 for a purchase price of $44.0 million and the 226-guestroom Courtyard by Marriott\u00ae in the West End of Nashville, TN for a purchase price of $71.0 million on January 19, 2016. The completion of the reverse 1031 Exchanges resulted in the deferral of taxable gains of approximately $74.0 million and the pay-down of our unsecured revolving credit facility by $105.0 million, resulting in additional borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving credit facility. Additionally, we repaid a mortgage loan totaling $5.8 million related to sale of the Springhill Suites in Denver, CO to ARCH.\nOn February 11, 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into a loan agreement with ARCH, as borrower, which provides for a loan by the Operating Partnership to ARCH in the amount of $27.5 million (the \u201cLoan\u201d). The proceeds of the Loan were required to be applied by ARCH as follows: (i) $20.0 million was applied toward the payment of a portion of the $108.3 million purchase price for the six hotels containing 707 guestrooms, which were acquired by an ARCH affiliated purchaser on February 11, 2016 as part of the ARCH Sale; and (ii) the remaining $7.5 million was applied by ARCH to fund the New Deposit under the Reinstated Purchase Agreement.\nThe entire principal amount of the Loan, and any accrued and unpaid interest, will be due and payable on February 11, 2017 (the \u201cMaturity Date\u201d), unless extended pursuant to the Loan agreement. ARCH will repay a portion of the outstanding principal balance of the Loan in an aggregate amount equal to $5.0 million, to be paid in five equal installments of $1.0 million, on the last day of May, June, July, August and September 2016 (the \u201cAmortization Payments\u201d). The Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time by ARCH, without payment of any penalty or premium. ARCH may extend the maturity date of the Loan under certain conditions by up to two years pursuant to two one-year extension options (each an \u201cExtension Option\u201d).\nInterest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the Loan at a rate of 13.0% per annum from the date of the Loan to the initial Maturity Date, 14.0% per annum during the first extension period and 15.0% per annum during the second extension period. An amount equal to 9.0% per annum is to be paid monthly. The remaining 4.0%, 5.0% and 6.0%, as the case may be, will accrue and be compounded monthly (the \u201cPIK\u201d). The PIK must be paid in order to exercise any Extension Option, otherwise the PIK is payable at the initial Maturity Date. The PIK may be paid in cash prior to the initial Maturity Date, or any extension thereof.\nTo secure the payment of the Amortization Payments, ARCH will cause the rents from certain hotel properties or assets of its taxable REIT subsidiaries to be deposited to a separate controlled account (the \u201cControl Account\u201d) and ARCH has granted the Operating Partnership a continuing security interest in all of its right, title and interest in and to the Control Account until the Amortization Payments have been satisfied in full in accordance with the terms of the Loan agreement.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe consider funds from operations (\u201cFFO\u201d) and EBITDA, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures, to be useful to investors as key supplemental measures of our operating performance. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of FFO and EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, since not all companies calculate these non-GAAP measures in the same manner. FFO and EBITDA should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income (loss) as a measure of our operating performance. FFO and EBITDA may include funds that may not be available for our discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures, property acquisitions, debt service obligations and other commitments and uncertainties. Although we believe that FFO and EBITDA can enhance the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily better indicators of any trend as compared to a comparable GAAP measure such as net income (loss).\nFunds From Operations\nAs defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, (\u201cNAREIT\u201d), FFO represents net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding preferred dividends, gains (or losses) from sales of real property, impairment losses on real estate assets, items classified by GAAP as extraordinary, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Unless otherwise indicated, we present FFO applicable to our common shares and Common Units. We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operational performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization related to real estate assets, gains and losses from real property dispositions and impairment losses on real estate assets, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the effect to operations from trends in occupancy, guestroom rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. Our computation of FFO differs from the computation of NAREIT-defined FFO and may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO used by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs because in addition to the amount of depreciation and amortization we add back to net income or loss, we also add back the amortization of deferred financing costs and the amortization of franchise application fees. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions. Where indicated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, FFO is based on our computation of FFO and not the computation of NAREIT-defined FFO unless otherwise noted.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our GAAP net income to FFO for the years ended December 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except per share/unit data):\n\n(1) Includes Common Units in the Operating Partnership held by limited partners (other than us and our subsidiaries) because the Common Units are redeemable for cash or, at our election, shares of our common stock.\n(2) The summation of these line items represents depreciation and amortization expense as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for each of the periods presented.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, FFO applicable to common shares and common units increased by $32.2 million, or 41.2%, over the prior year primarily due to an increase in revenues of $60.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 in comparison with the prior year, which resulted in an increase in net income (adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, loss on impairment of assets, equity-based compensation and gains on the disposal of assets) of $34.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 over the prior year. The increase in revenues was the result of increases in occupancy and ADR as discussed below under \u201cResults of Operations - Comparison of 2015 to 2014 - Revenues.\u201d Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, FFO increased because loss on impairment of assets declined $8.1 million in comparison with the prior year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, FFO applicable to common shares and common units increased by $29.7 million, or 61.2%, over the prior year primarily due to an increase in revenues of $104.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 in comparison with the prior year, which resulted in an increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $15.0 million over the prior year. The increase in revenues was the result of increases in occupancy and ADR as discussed below under \u201cResults of Operations - Comparison of 2014 to 2013 - Revenues.\u201d\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization\nEBITDA represents net income or loss, excluding: (i) interest, (ii) income tax expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt, to satisfy general operating expenses, to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs or reinvest cash into our business. We also believe it helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIndustry Trends and Outlook\nRoom-night demand in the U.S. lodging industry is generally correlated to macroeconomic trends. Key drivers of demand include growth in GDP, corporate profits, capital investments and employment. Although we remain optimistic that our hotel properties will realize RevPAR gains despite the recent volatility of the economy and lodging industry, the risk exists that global and domestic economic conditions may cause the economic growth to slow or stall, which likely would adversely affect our growth expectations.\nThe U.S. lodging industry experienced a positive trend through 2015 that we expect to continue through 2016. According to a report prepared in January 2016 by PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, U.S. RevPAR growth in 2015 for Upscale hotels and Upper-midscale hotels was 5.6% and 6.3%, respectively, while projected 2016 RevPar growth is 4.7% and 5.4% respectively. We continue to have a positive outlook about national macro-economic conditions and their effect on room-night demand; however, as occupancy levels stabilize, growth expectations for fiscal year 2016 are expected to decelerate from those experienced in 2015. While the supply of new hotels under construction has increased and is expected to accelerate in 2016, we expect that our operating results will not be adversely affected to a substantial degree by increased lodging supply in our markets.\nOperating Performance Metrics\nWe use a variety of operating performance indicators and other information to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of our business. These key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as other financial information that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, we use other information that may not be financial in nature, including statistical information and comparative data. We use this information to measure the performance of individual hotel properties, groups of hotel properties and/or our business as a whole. We periodically compare historical information to our internal budgets as well as industry-wide information. These key indicators include:\n\u00b7 Occupancy - Occupancy represents the total number of guestrooms occupied divided by the total number of guestrooms available.\n\u00b7 Average Daily Rate (ADR) - ADR represents total room revenues divided by the total number of guestrooms occupied.\n\u00b7 Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR) - RevPAR is the product of ADR and Occupancy.\nOccupancy, ADR and RevPAR are commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate operating performance. RevPAR is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel property level and across our business as a whole. We evaluate individual hotel RevPAR performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget and prior periods, as well as on a company-wide and regional basis. ADR and RevPAR include only room revenue. Room revenue depends on demand (as measured by occupancy), pricing (as measured by ADR), and our available supply of hotel guestrooms. Our ADR, occupancy and RevPAR performance may be affected by macroeconomic factors such as regional and local employment growth, personal income and corporate earnings, office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions, airport and other business and leisure travel, new hotel property construction, and the pricing strategies of competitors. In addition, our ADR, occupancy and RevPAR performance is dependent on the continued success of our franchisors and brands.\nHotel Property Portfolio Activity\nAcquisitions\nWe acquired seven hotel properties in 2015 and six hotel properties in 2014.

See Item 7. - \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Hotel Property Portfolio Activity - Other Hotel Property Investment Activities.\u201d\nOn January 19, 2016, we acquired the 226-guestroom Courtyard by Marriott in the West End of Nashville, TN for $71.0 million. On January 20, 2016, we acquired the 160-guestroom Residence Inn in midtown Atlanta, GA for $38.0 million. The acquisitions (collectively, the \u201cNoble Acquisition\u201d) were made using funds drawn on the Company's revolving line of credit. Both hotels were parked with a Qualified Intermediary in anticipation of completing reverse 1031 Exchanges. The reverse 1031 Exchange related to the Courtyard by Marriott in the West End of Nashville, TN was completed immediately after the closing of the sale of six hotel properties to ARCH on February 11, 2016.\nThe purchase price and renovation costs are funded by mortgage debt, advances on our senior unsecured revolving line of credit facility, cash and the issuance of Common Units in our operating partnership described in footnote 1 to the table above. Additional information about the mortgage debt financing is provided below in \u201cOutstanding Indebtedness - Mortgage Loans.\u201d\nOf the total renovation costs detailed in the table above, $11.9 million have been incurred as of December 31, 2015. There is no assurance that our actual renovation costs will not exceed our estimates.\nDispositions\nPursuant to our strategy to periodically evaluate our hotel properties and land held for development, we sold ten hotel properties in 2015 and four hotel properties and three parcels of land held for development in 2014. Historically, when a property was identified as being held for sale, we reclassified the property on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, evaluated for potential impairment and in the case of a hotel property, reported historical and future results of operations in discontinued operations.\nAs discussed in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) ASU No. 2014-08, \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity,\u201d was required to be adopted during the first quarter of 2015; however, we elected early adoption in the first quarter of 2014, which is permitted for disposals and classifications of assets as \u201cheld for sale\u201d provided that such assets had not been reported previously in discontinued operations. ASU No. 2014-08 changed the criteria for discontinued operations to include only disposals that represent a strategic shift in operations with a major effect on operations and results. As such, the results of operations for the AmericInn Hotel & Suites, Aspen Hotel & Suites and Hampton Inn in Fort Smith, AR were classified as discontinued operations until the sale of the properties during the year ended December 31, 2014. Under ASU 2014-08, the Company anticipates that the majority of future property sales will not be classified as discontinued operations.\nA summary of the dispositions in 2015 and 2014 follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> Disposition\nDate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Franchise/Brand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Gross Sales\nPrice\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2015:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Hampton Inn\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Medford, OR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> DoubleTree\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Baton Rouge, LA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fairfield Inn & Suites\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Baton Rouge, LA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Springhill Suites\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Baton Rouge, LA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> TownePlace Suites\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Baton Rouge, LA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Hampton Inn & Suites\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> El Paso, TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Hampton Inn\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fort Wayne, IN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Residence Inn\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fort Wayne, IN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Courtyard\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Flagstaff, AZ\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Springhill Suites\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Flagstaff, AZ\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 150,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2014:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> AmericInn Hotel & Suites and Aspen Hotel & Suites\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fort Smith, AR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,080\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Hampton Inn\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fort Smith, AR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,800\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Country Inn & Suites and adjacent land parcels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> San Antonio, TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,900\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The sale of these hotel properties included the assignment of the related ground leases.\n(2) The sale of this property included three adjacent land parcels totaling 5.64 acres.\nOther Hotel Property Investment Activities\nOn December 29, 2015, the Company and ARCH agreed to terminate the Real Estate Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of June 2, 2015 (as amended thereafter and as subsequently terminated, the \u201cTerminated Purchase Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which ARCH had the right to acquire fee simple interests in the ten hotels listed below containing a total of 996 guestrooms for an aggregate purchase price of $89.1 million at a closing that had been scheduled to occur on December 29, 2015. As a result of the termination, ARCH forfeited and we retained the $9.1 million earnest money deposit made under the Terminated Purchase Agreement and the parties were released from further obligations under the Terminated Purchase Agreement, except those which expressly survive the termination of the Terminated Purchase Agreement pursuant to its terms. This transaction had not been structured as a 1031 Exchange. The receipt of the $9.1 million of forfeited earnest money was recorded as Other Income on our Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn June 2, 2015, we entered into two separate agreements, as amended on July 15, 2015 (collectively, the \u201cARCH Agreements\u201d), to sell a portfolio of 26 hotels containing an aggregate of 2,793 guestrooms to ARCH for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $347.4 million (the \u201cARCH Sale\u201d). The hotels were to be sold in three separate closings. The first closing of ten hotels containing 1,090 guestrooms was completed on October 15, 2015 for an aggregate cash payment of $150.1 million.\nOn December 29, 2015, we and ARCH agreed to terminate the ARCH Agreements with respect to ARCH's right to acquire fee simple interests in ten hotels containing a total of 996 guestrooms for an aggregate purchase price of $89.1 million at a closing that had been scheduled to occur on December 29, 2015 (the \u201cTerminated Purchase Agreement\u201d). As a result of the termination, ARCH forfeited and we retained, the $9.1 million earnest money deposit made by ARCH under the ARCH Agreements related to the sale of these ten hotels and the parties were released from further obligations, except those which expressly survive the termination of the ARCH Agreements pursuant to its terms. This transaction had not been structured as a 1031 Exchange. The receipt of the $9.1 million of forfeited earnest money was recorded as Other Income on our Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn February 11, 2016, the Company and American Realty Capital Hospitality Portfolio SMT ALT, LLC, an affiliate of ARCH, as substitute purchaser (\u201cNew ARCH Purchaser\u201d), entered into a letter agreement (the \u201cReinstatement Agreement\u201d) and agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of the Reinstatement Agreement, to reinstate the Terminated Purchase Agreement in its entirety, except as modified by the Reinstatement Agreement (the Terminated Purchase Agreement, as reinstated and modified by the Reinstatement Agreement, is referred to herein as the \u201cReinstated Purchase Agreement\u201d), to make null and void the prior termination of the Terminated Purchase Agreement and to proceed with the proposed sale of the ten hotels listed below (the \u201cReinstated Hotels\u201d) pursuant to the Reinstated Purchase Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $89.1 million. The Reinstated Hotels are being sold to the New ARCH Purchaser as part of the ARCH Sale. As stated above, we previously sold ten of the 26 hotels to ARCH at a closing that occurred on October 15, 2015 for a purchase price of $150.1 million. As disclosed below, we sold six of the 26 hotels to an ARCH affiliated purchaser at a closing that occurred on February 11, 2016 for a purchase price of $108.3 million. The 16 hotels previously sold to ARCH affiliated purchasers were sold by us pursuant to a separate real estate purchase and sale agreement relating to the sale of those hotels.\nThe Reinstated Hotels are as follows:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> LOCATION\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ROOMS\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residence Inn - Jackson, MS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Holiday Inn Express - Vernon Hills, IL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Courtyard by Marriott - Germantown, TN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Courtyard by Marriott - Jackson, MS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fairfield Inn & Suites - Germantown, TN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residence Inn - Germantown, TN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aloft - Jacksonville, FL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Staybridge Suites - Ridgeland, MS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Homewood Suites - Ridgeland, MS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Courtyard by Marriott - El Paso, TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Reinstatement Agreement requires the New ARCH Purchaser to deposit non-refundable earnest money in the amount of $7.5 million (the \u201cNew Deposit\u201d) with an escrow agent to support the closing of the Reinstated Hotels. The New Deposit is non-refundable to the New ARCH Purchaser except in limited circumstances. The prior earnest money deposit in the amount of $9.1 million was retained by us in connection with the termination of the Terminated Purchase Agreement and will not be credited to the New ARCH Purchaser against the purchase price for the Reinstated Hotels. The closing of the sale of the Reinstated Hotels is scheduled to occur on or before December 30, 2016 (the \u201cNew Closing Date\u201d), or at such later date as the closing may be adjourned or extended in accordance with the express terms of the Reinstatement Agreement. If the closing of the Reinstated Hotels does not occur as required by the Reinstatement Agreement because of a default by the New ARCH Purchaser, then the New ARCH Purchaser will forfeit the New Deposit to us as liquidated damages.\nPrior to the New Closing Date, we have the right to continue to market and ultimately sell, without the consent of the New ARCH Purchaser, any or all of the Reinstated Hotels to a bona fide third-party purchaser that is not an affiliate of ours. If we sell some, but not all, of the Reinstated Hotels to a bona fide third-party purchaser, then the purchase price to be paid by the New ARCH Purchaser for the remaining Reinstated Hotels will be reduced accordingly (the \u201cRevised Purchase Price\u201d), but the New Deposit will remain with the escrow agent except in limited circumstances.\nOn February 11, 2016, we completed the sale of the following six hotels as part of the ARCH Sale:\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> LOCATION\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ROOMS\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fairfield Inn & Suites - Spokane, WA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fairfield Inn & Suites - Denver, CO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SpringHill Suites - Denver, CO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hampton Inn - Fort Collins, CO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fairfield Inn & Suites - Bellevue, WA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hilton Garden Inn - Fort Collins, CO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe six hotels were sold to ARCH for an aggregate purchase price of $108.3 million, and proceeds from the sale of the six hotels were used to complete certain reverse 1031 Exchanges. The hotels acquired by us for the reverse 1031 Exchanges included the 179-guestroom Courtyard by Marriott\u00ae in Atlanta (Decatur), GA on October 20, 2015 for a purchase price of $44.0 million and the 226-guestroom Courtyard by Marriott\u00ae in the West End of Nashville, TN for a purchase price of $71.0 million on January 19, 2016. The completion of the reverse 1031 Exchanges resulted in the deferral of taxable gains of approximately $74.0 million and the pay-down of our unsecured revolving credit facility by $105.0 million, resulting in additional borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving credit facility. Additionally, we repaid a mortgage loan totaling $5.8 million related to sale of the Springhill Suites in Denver, CO to ARCH.\nOn February 11, 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into a loan agreement with ARCH, as borrower, which provides for a loan by the Operating Partnership to ARCH in the amount of $27.5 million (the \u201cLoan\u201d). The proceeds of the Loan were required to be applied by ARCH as follows: (i) $20.0 million was applied toward the payment of a portion of the $108.3 million purchase price for the six hotels containing 707 guestrooms, which were acquired by an ARCH affiliated purchaser on February 11, 2016 as part of the ARCH Sale; and (ii) the remaining $7.5 million was applied by ARCH to fund the New Deposit under the Reinstated Purchase Agreement.\nThe entire principal amount of the Loan, and any accrued and unpaid interest, will be due and payable on February 11, 2017 (the \u201cMaturity Date\u201d), unless extended pursuant to the Loan agreement. ARCH will repay a portion of the outstanding principal balance of the Loan in an aggregate amount equal to $5.0 million, to be paid in five equal installments of $1.0 million, on the last day of May, June, July, August and September 2016 (the \u201cAmortization Payments\u201d). The Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time by ARCH, without payment of any penalty or premium. ARCH may extend the maturity date of the Loan under certain conditions by up to two years pursuant to two one-year extension options (each an \u201cExtension Option\u201d).\nInterest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the Loan at a rate of 13.0% per annum from the date of the Loan to the initial Maturity Date, 14.0% per annum during the first extension period and 15.0% per annum during the second extension period. An amount equal to 9.0% per annum is to be paid monthly. The remaining 4.0%, 5.0% and 6.0%, as the case may be, will accrue and be compounded monthly (the \u201cPIK\u201d). The PIK must be paid in order to exercise any Extension Option, otherwise the PIK is payable at the initial Maturity Date. The PIK may be paid in cash prior to the initial Maturity Date, or any extension thereof.\nTo secure the payment of the Amortization Payments, ARCH will cause the rents from certain hotel properties or assets of its taxable REIT subsidiaries to be deposited to a separate controlled account (the \u201cControl Account\u201d) and ARCH has granted the Operating Partnership a continuing security interest in all of its right, title and interest in and to the Control Account until the Amortization Payments have been satisfied in full in accordance with the terms of the Loan agreement.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe consider funds from operations (\u201cFFO\u201d) and EBITDA, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures, to be useful to investors as key supplemental measures of our operating performance. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of FFO and EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, since not all companies calculate these non-GAAP measures in the same manner. FFO and EBITDA should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income (loss) as a measure of our operating performance. FFO and EBITDA may include funds that may not be available for our discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures, property acquisitions, debt service obligations and other commitments and uncertainties. Although we believe that FFO and EBITDA can enhance the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily better indicators of any trend as compared to a comparable GAAP measure such as net income (loss).\nFunds From Operations\nAs defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, (\u201cNAREIT\u201d), FFO represents net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding preferred dividends, gains (or losses) from sales of real property, impairment losses on real estate assets, items classified by GAAP as extraordinary, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Unless otherwise indicated, we present FFO applicable to our common shares and Common Units. We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operational performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization related to real estate assets, gains and losses from real property dispositions and impairment losses on real estate assets, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the effect to operations from trends in occupancy, guestroom rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. Our computation of FFO differs from the computation of NAREIT-defined FFO and may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO used by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs because in addition to the amount of depreciation and amortization we add back to net income or loss, we also add back the amortization of deferred financing costs and the amortization of franchise application fees. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions. Where indicated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, FFO is based on our computation of FFO and not the computation of NAREIT-defined FFO unless otherwise noted.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our GAAP net income to FFO for the years ended December 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except per share/unit data):\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 125,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Preferred dividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,588\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (16,588\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (14,590\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income applicable to common shares and common units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,693\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate-related depreciation (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on impairment of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on disposal of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (65,067\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (446\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (4,308\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-controlling interest in joint venture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (316\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments related to joint venture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (204\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (315\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NAREIT-defined FFO applicable to common shares and common units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 108,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of franchise application fees (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO applicable to common shares and common units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO per common share/common unit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average diluted common shares/common units (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 86,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes Common Units in the Operating Partnership held by limited partners (other than us and our subsidiaries) because the Common Units are redeemable for cash or, at our election, shares of our common stock.\n(2) The summation of these line items represents depreciation and amortization expense as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for each of the periods presented.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, FFO applicable to common shares and common units increased by $32.2 million, or 41.2%, over the prior year primarily due to an increase in revenues of $60.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 in comparison with the prior year, which resulted in an increase in net income (adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, loss on impairment of assets, equity-based compensation and gains on the disposal of assets) of $34.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 over the prior year. The increase in revenues was the result of increases in occupancy and ADR as discussed below under \u201cResults of Operations - Comparison of 2015 to 2014 - Revenues.\u201d Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, FFO increased because loss on impairment of assets declined $8.1 million in comparison with the prior year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, FFO applicable to common shares and common units increased by $29.7 million, or 61.2%, over the prior year primarily due to an increase in revenues of $104.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 in comparison with the prior year, which resulted in an increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $15.0 million over the prior year. The increase in revenues was the result of increases in occupancy and ADR as discussed below under \u201cResults of Operations - Comparison of 2014 to 2013 - Revenues.\u201d\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization\nEBITDA represents net income or loss, excluding: (i) interest, (ii) income tax expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt, to satisfy general operating expenses, to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs or reinvest cash into our business. We also believe it helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations"}
