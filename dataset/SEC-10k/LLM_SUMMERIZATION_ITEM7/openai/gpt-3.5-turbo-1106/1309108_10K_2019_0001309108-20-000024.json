MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussion below focuses on the factors affecting our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and financial condition at December 31, 2019 and 2018 and, where appropriate, factors that may affect our future financial performance, unless stated otherwise.

Pursuant to the purchase agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, WEX will acquire all of the issued share capital of eNett and Optal from Travelport Limited, Toro Private Holdings I, Ltd., and the other shareholders of eNett and Optal, for an aggregate purchase price comprised of approximately $1.3 billion in cash and 2.0 million shares of the Company's common stock and subject to certain working capital and other adjustments as described in the purchase agreement. The parties' obligations to consummate the acquisition are subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.\nSegments\nWEX operates in three reportable segments: Fleet Solutions, Travel and Corporate Solutions, and Health and Employee Benefit Solutions. Our Fleet Solutions segment provides payment, transaction processing and information management services specifically designed for the needs of commercial and government fleets. Our Travel and Corporate Solutions segment focuses on the complex payment environment of business-to-business payments, providing customers with payment processing solutions for their corporate payment and transaction monitoring needs. Our Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment provides a SaaS platform for consumer directed healthcare payments, as well as payroll related benefits to customers in Brazil.\nResults of Operations\nThe Company does not allocate foreign currency gains and losses, financing interest expense, unrealized and realized gains and losses on financial instruments, income taxes, net gains or losses from non-controlling interests, and non-cash adjustments related to our tax receivable agreement to our operating segments, as management believes these items are unpredictable and can obscure underlying trends. In addition, the Company does not allocate certain corporate expenses to our operating segments, as these items are centrally controlled and are not directly attributable to any reportable segment.\nSources of Operating Expense\nCost of Services\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Processing costs - The Company's processing costs consist of expenses related to processing transactions, servicing customers and merchants and cost of goods sold related to hardware and other product sales.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Service fees - The Company incurs costs from third-party networks utilized to deliver payment solutions.

These unfavorable impacts were almost entirely offset by higher payment processing volumes and the acquisition of the Go Fuel Card business. Over half of the late fee and volume increases were due to the onboarding of two major North American oil portfolios.\nAccount servicing revenue in 2019 was generally consistent with account servicing revenue in 2018.\nFinance fee revenue is comprised of the following components:\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>208,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Factoring fee revenue\n</td> <td>36,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(911\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total finance fee revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinance income primarily consists of late fees and interest charged for receivables not paid within the terms of the customer agreement based upon the outstanding customer receivable balance. This revenue is earned when a customer's receivable balance becomes delinquent and is calculated using the greater of a minimum charge or a stated late fee rate multiplied by the outstanding balance that is subject to a late fee charge. Changes in the absolute amount of such outstanding balances can be attributed, including, but not limited to (i) changes in fuel prices; (ii) customer specific transaction volume; and (iii) customer specific delinquencies. Late fee revenue can also be impacted by (i) changes in late fee rates and (ii) increases or decreases in customer overdue balances. Late fee rates are determined and set based primarily on the risk associated with our customers, coupled with a strategic view of standard rates within our industry. Periodically, we assess the market rates associated within our industry to determine appropriate late fee rates. We consider factors such as the Company's overall financial model and strategic plan, the cost to our business from\ncustomers failing to pay timely and the impact such late payments have on our financial results. These assessments are typically conducted at least annually but may occur more often depending on macro-economic factors.\nFinance income increased $55.5 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily attributable to customer acquisitions and higher weighted average late fee rates in near equal proportions, partly offset by lower average customer receivables as a result of the decline in domestic price per gallon. For the majority of 2019, monthly late fee rates and minimum finance charges ranged up to 9.99 percent and $75, respectively, as compared to monthly late fee rates and minimum finance charges of up to 7.99 percent and $75, respectively, during 2018. The weighted average late fee rate, net of related charge-offs was 5.4 percent and 4.5 percent for 2019 and 2018, respectively. Concessions to certain customers experiencing financial difficulties may be granted and are limited to extending the time to pay, placing a customer on a payment plan or granting waivers of late fees. There were no material concessions to customers experiencing financial difficulties during either of 2019 or 2018.\nThe primary source of factoring fee revenue is calculated as a negotiated percentage fee of the receivable balance that we purchase. A secondary source of factoring fee revenue is a flat rate service fee to our customers that request a non-contractual same day funding of the receivable balance. Factoring fee revenue for 2019 was generally consistent with 2018.\nOther revenue increased $14.4 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to increased fees associated with growth in vehicles serviced.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table compares line items within operating income for Fleet Solutions:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Processing costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>205,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Provision for credit losses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating interest\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,225\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>365,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>352,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of services\nProcessing costs increased $14.9 million for 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to higher expenses associated with the onboarding of customer acquisitions.\nService fees for 2019 were generally consistent with service fees in in 2018.\nProvision for credit losses increased $5.3 million for 2019, as compared to 2018 due to an increase in credit losses related to smaller customers in our over-the-road business, partly offset by lower fraud losses.\nWe generally measure our credit loss performance by calculating fuel-related credit losses as a percentage of total fuel expenditures on payment processing transactions. This metric for credit losses was 15.1 basis points of fuel expenditures for 2019, as compared to 12.5 basis points of fuel expenditures for 2018. We generally use a roll-rate methodology to calculate the amount necessary for our ending receivable reserve balance. This methodology considers total receivable balances, recent charge-off experience, recoveries on previously charged off accounts, and the dollars that are delinquent to calculate the total reserve. In addition, management undertakes a detailed evaluation of the receivable balances to help further ensure overall reserve adequacy. The expense we recognize in each quarter is the amount necessary to bring the reserve to its required level based on accounts receivable aging and net charge offs.\nOperating interest expense increased $5.6 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher interest rates paid on deposits and volume growth.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $3.9 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to the amortization of merchant networks obtained in the Go Fuel Card acquisition.\nOther operating expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $7.3 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to acquisition-related costs during 2019 and higher stock-based compensation associated with the Company's performance.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $10.9 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to an increase in personnel-related costs resulting from higher volumes and financial performance, as well as higher marketing costs related to significant 2019 customer acquisitions.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $5.0 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to the amortization of the Chevron customer portfolio intangible asset and customer relationships obtained in the Go Fuel Card acquisition. This increase was partly offset by lower amortization expense on intangible assets related to acquisitions from prior periods.\nDuring our annual goodwill assessment completed in the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $3.2 million for our Brazil fleet reporting unit.

The increase was partly offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The contract amendment resulted in an increase in payment processing revenue, with an offsetting reduction in other revenue.\nAccount servicing revenue increased $6.0 million for 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to the acquisition of Noventis and higher SaaS licensing fees earned on our accounts receivable and accounts payable platforms.\nFinance fee revenue was not material to Travel and Corporate Solutions' operations in 2019 or 2018. Concessions to certain customers experiencing financial difficulties may be granted and are limited to extending the time to pay, placing a customer on a payment plan or granting waivers of late fees. There were no material concessions to customers experiencing financial difficulties during either 2019 or 2018.\nOther revenue decreased $42.3 million for 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to

2019, were generally consistent with service fees in 2018, as benefits resulting from the onboarding of transactions to an internal processing platform were offset by the impact of higher volumes.\nProvision for credit losses decreased $1.4 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, resulting from recoveries on amounts previously charged-off and the absence of a discrete customer reserve taken during 2018.\nOperating interest increased $3.2 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher interest rates paid on deposits and volume growth.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased $1.8 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to the amortization of software obtained in the Noventis acquisition, partly offset by lower amortization expense on intangible assets related to acquisitions from prior periods.\nOther operating expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $10.0 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to costs associated with the Noventis acquisition including the expense incurred to accelerate vesting of options awards.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $11.0 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher relative commission payments to partners and the Noventis acquisition.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $3.3 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to higher amortization on customer relationships obtained as part of the Noventis acquisition.\nDuring 2018, we recognized a $2.4 million non-cash impairment charge to write-off certain property and equipment.\nHealth and Employee Benefit Solutions\nRevenues\nThe following table reflects comparative revenue and key operating statistics within Health and Employee Benefit Solutions:\nTable 134:

increased $13.3 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to realized gains on the sale of WEX Latin America customer receivables under a securitization arrangement. Prior to an amendment of this securitization arrangement during the third quarter of 2018, the revenue associated with these customer receivables was primarily included in finance fee revenue. The increase in other revenue was also attributable to growth in ancillary services to cardholders as a result of the increased number of SaaS platform participants and HSA assets.

In 2019, net foreign currency loss was $0.9 million, as compared to $38.8 million in 2018. In 2018, the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to all major foreign currencies in which we transact, including the Euro, British pound sterling, Australian dollar, Brazilian real and Canadian dollar.\nNet unrealized loss on financial instruments increased $37.2 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to a decrease in the LIBOR forward yield curve.\nNon-cash adjustments related to tax receivable agreement were not material to operations in 2019 or 2018.\nOur effective tax rate was 28.3 percent for 2019 as compared to 28.9 percent for 2018. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the jurisdictional earnings mix.\nNet (loss) income from non-controlling interests relates to our non-controlling interests in WEX Europe Services and the U.S. Health business.

The Company considers this measure integral because it excludes the above-specified items that the Company's management excludes in evaluating the Company's performance. Specifically, in addition to evaluating the Company's performance on a GAAP basis, management evaluates the Company's performance on a basis that excludes the above items because:\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Exclusion of the non-cash, mark-to-market adjustments on financial instruments, including interest rate swap agreements and investment securities, helps management identify and assess trends in the Company's underlying business that might otherwise be obscured due to quarterly non-cash earnings fluctuations associated with these financial instruments.

In addition, the size and complexity of an acquisition, which often drives the magnitude of acquisition-related costs, may not be indicative of such future costs.

Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. We continually evaluate our judgments and estimates in determination of our financial condition and operating results. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and, accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates, sometimes materially. Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require management's most subjective judgments. Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of critical accounting policies and estimates, the most significant of which are included in the tables below.\nRevenue Recognition\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Assumptions/Approach Used\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect if Actual Results Differ from\nAssumptions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The majority of the Company's revenues are comprised of transaction-based fees, which are generally calculated based on measures such as: (i) percentage of dollar value of volume processed; (ii) number of transactions processed; or (iii) some combination thereof.\nInterchange income, a fee paid by a merchant bank to the card-issuing bank (the Company) through the interchange network, is earned from the Company's suite of card products. Interchange fees are set by the credit card providers.\nThe Company has entered into agreements with major oil companies, fuel retailers and vehicle maintenance providers, online travel agencies and health partners which provide products and/or services to the Company's customers. These agreements specify that a transaction is deemed to be captured when the Company has validated that the transaction has no errors and has accepted and posted the data to the Company's records.\nAccount servicing revenue is primarily comprised of monthly fees charged to cardholders. The Company also recognizes SaaS based service fees in the healthcare market and licensing fees for use of our accounts receivable and accounts payable SaaS platforms.\nThe Company earns revenue on overdue accounts, calculated using the greater of a minimum charge or a stated late fee rate multiplied by the outstanding balance that is subject to a late fee charge.\nThe Company assesses fees for providing ancillary services, such as information products and services, software development projects and other services sold subsequent to the core offerings. Other revenues also include international settlement fees, fees for overnight shipping, certain customized electronic reporting and customer contact services provided on behalf of certain of the Company's customers.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>The Company's primary performance obligation to merchants is a stand-ready commitment to provide payment and transaction processing services as the merchant requires, which is satisfied over time in daily increments.\nWithin our Travel and Corporate Solutions and Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segments, we provide SaaS services and support, which is satisfied over time in a series of daily increments. Revenue is recognized based on an output method using days elapsed to measure progress as the Company transfers control evenly over each monthly subscription period.\nThe Company enters into contracts with certain large customers or strategic cardholders that provide for fee rebates tied to performance milestones. When such rebates constitute consideration payable to a customer or other parties that purchase services from the customer, they are considered variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction in payment processing revenue in the same period that related interchange income is recognized. Fee rebates made to certain other partners were determined to be costs to obtain a contract and are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.\nThe Company earns revenue on overdue accounts, which is recognized as revenue at the time the fees are assessed.\nThe Company generally records revenue net of consideration retained based upon its conclusion that the Company is the agent in its principal versus agent relationships.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>In preparing the financial statements, management must make estimates related to contractual terms, customer performance and sales volumes to determine the total amounts recorded as deductions, such as rebates and incentives, from revenue. Rebates and incentives are calculated based on estimated performance and the terms of the related business agreements. Management also considers historical results in making such estimates. The actual amounts ultimately paid to the customer may be different from our estimates. Such differences are recorded once they have been determined and have historically not been significant.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Item 8 - Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for accounting guidance applied prior to the Company's adoption of Topic 606.\nReserve for Credit Losses\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Assumptions/Approach Used\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect if Actual Results Differ from\nAssumptions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The reserve for losses relating to accounts receivable represents management's estimate of the losses inherent in the Company's outstanding portfolio of receivables, including fraud losses. The reserve for credit losses reduces the Company's accounts receivable balances, as reported in its financial statements, to the net realizable value.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Management has consistently considered its portfolio of charge card receivables as a large group of smaller balance accounts that it has collectively evaluated for impairment. Reserves for losses on these receivables are primarily based on a model that analyzes specific portfolio statistics, including average charge-off rates for various stages of receivable aging (including: current, 30 days, 60 days and 90 days) over historical periods including average bankruptcy and recovery rates. Receivables are generally written off when they are 150 days past due or upon declaration of bankruptcy by the customer.\nThe reserve reflects management's judgment regarding overall reserve adequacy. Management considers whether to adjust the reserve that is calculated by the analytic model based on other factors, such as the actual charge-offs for the preceding reporting periods, expected charge-offs and recoveries for the subsequent reporting periods, a review of accounts receivable balances that become past due, changes in customer payment patterns, known fraudulent activity in the portfolio, as well as leading economic and market indicators.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>To the extent historical credit experience is not indicative of future performance, actual loss experience could differ significantly from management's judgments and expectations, resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for credit losses, as applicable. As of December 31, 2019, we have an estimated reserve for credit losses that is 1.93 percent of the total gross accounts receivable balance.\nAn increase or decrease to this reserve by 0.5 percent of the total gross accounts receivable balance would increase or decrease the provision for credit losses for the year by $13.6 million. As of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our reserve for credit losses in an annual period has ranged from 1.34 percent to 1.93 percent of the total gross accounts receivable balance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBusiness Combinations, Acquired Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Assumptions/Approach Used\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect if Actual Results Differ from\nAssumptions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business combinations are accounted for at fair value. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets and liabilities acquired.\nAn acquisition not meeting the criteria to be accounted for as a business combination is accounted for as an asset acquisition. Asset acquisitions are recorded at purchase price, allocated based on the relative fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities. No goodwill is recorded in an asset acquisition.\nGoodwill is comprised of the cost of business acquisitions in excess of the fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Acquired intangible assets result from the allocation of the cost of an acquisition.\nGoodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually, or when events or changes in the business environment indicate that the carrying value of the reporting units may exceed their fair value. The annual review of goodwill is performed as of October 1 of each year.\nThe Company tests definite-lived intangible assets for impairment if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nSuch circumstances would include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the perceived market price of the intangible, a significant adverse change in the way the asset is being used, or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the intangible.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including projected financial information, effective income tax rates, present value discount factors, and long-term growth expectations. The Company utilizes third-party specialists to assist management with the identification and valuation of intangible assets using customary valuation procedures and techniques.\nThe Company's annual goodwill impairment test is quantitative. For the reporting units that carry goodwill balances, our impairment test consists of a comparison of each reporting unit's carrying value to its estimated fair value. A reporting unit, for the purpose of the impairment test, is one level below the operating segment level. We have three reporting segments that are further broken into several reporting units for the impairment review. The estimated fair value for the majority of our reporting units is estimated using a combination of discounted estimated future cash flows and prices for comparable businesses. An appropriate discount rate is used, as well as risk premium for specific business units, based on the Company's cost of capital or reporting unit-specific economic factors. We generally validate the model through a reconciliation of the fair value of all our reporting units to our overall market capitalization. The assumptions used to estimate the discounted cash flows are based on our best estimates about payment processing fees/interchange rates, sales volumes, costs (including fuel prices), future growth rates, working capital needs, capital expenditures and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining operating period at the reporting unit level. The discount rate at each reporting unit is based on the weighted average cost of capital that is determined by evaluating the risk free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums.\nThe Company evaluates its definite-lived intangible assets for impairment under certain circumstances. Such assessment includes considering any negative financial performance, legal, regulatory, contractual or other factors that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the asset and other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in strategy or customers that could affect significant inputs used in determining fair value. If the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the asset is impaired, then the Company does not perform a quantitative impairment test. If the Company determines that the asset is more likely than not impaired, then a quantitative test is performed comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount and impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. Fair value measurements under FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 820 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, are based on the assumptions of market participants. When determining the fair value of the asset group, entities must consider the highest and best use of the assets from a market-participant perspective.\nIf the Company incorrectly estimates the useful lives of its intangible assets, it would result in inaccurate amortization expense, which may lead to future impairment.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units. The profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically from downturns in customer demand or other economic factors. Individual reporting units may be more impacted than the Company as a whole. Specifically, during times of economic slowdown, our customers may reduce their expenditures. As a result, demand for the services of one or more of the reporting units could decline, which could adversely affect our operations, cash flow, and liquidity and could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets.\nOur 2019 goodwill impairment test indicated an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount of our reporting units ranging from approximately $16 million to $3.4 billion.\nAlthough no reporting units are deemed at risk of impairment as of December 31, 2019, there exists the potential for future impairment should actual results deteriorate versus our current expectations. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $4.0 billion on its consolidated balance sheet related to goodwill and intangible assets of acquired entities.\nThe Company did not record any goodwill and intangible asset impairments during either of the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2017.\nDuring our annual goodwill impairment test performed as of October 1, 2018, we assessed the impact of a customer loss significant to our Brazil fleet business. Based on a comparison of the calculated fair value of this reporting unit to its carrying value, the Company recorded a $3.2 million goodwill impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2018. There is no remaining net goodwill associated with this reporting unit. The Company did not record any intangible asset impairments during the year ended December 31, 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Assumptions/Approach Used\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect if Actual Results Differ from\nAssumptions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we calculate income tax expense (benefit) based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate current tax obligations and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. These differences result in long-term deferred tax assets and liabilities, the net amount of which we show as a line item on the consolidated balance sheet. All or a portion of the benefit of income tax positions is recognized only when we have made a determination that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based upon the technical merits of the position and other factors. For tax positions that are determined to be more likely than not sustained upon examination, the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We must also assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nTo the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance, we generally record a corresponding income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income in the period of the change. Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that realization is more likely than not, the valuation allowance is decreased to the amount realizable, which generates an income tax benefit.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Management must make judgments to determine income tax expense (benefit), deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against deferred tax assets. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Changes in our estimates occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, changes in business operations, implementation of tax planning strategies, the expiration of relevant statutes of limitations, resolution with taxing authorities of uncertain tax positions and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining valuation allowances. In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In establishing a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, assumptions are made in determining whether, and to what extent, a tax position may be sustained. It requires significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation as they apply to our particular facts and circumstances.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Although we believe that our income tax related judgments and estimates are reasonable, it is possible that our actual results could be different than what we expected, and we may be exposed to a material change in our total income tax expense, tax-related balances, or valuation allowances. Upon income tax audit, any unfavorable tax settlement may require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of settlement. A favorable tax settlement could be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of settlement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Item 8 - Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, for recently issued accounting standards that have not yet been adopted.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Cash Flows\nWe believe that our cash generating capability, financial condition and operations, together with the sources of cash listed below, will be adequate to fund our cash needs for at least the next 12 months.

This was primarily due to net repayments under our 2016 Credit Agreement and our participation debt due to a WEX Bank factoring arrangement entered into in August 2018. These cash outflows were partly offset by $178.0 million of term loan borrowings as a result of the amendments to our 2016 Credit Agreement in January and August 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity\nIn general, the Company's trade receivables provide for payment terms of 30 days or less. Receivables not paid within the terms of the agreement are generally subject to late fees based upon the outstanding receivable balance. The Company extends revolving credit to certain small fleets. These accounts are also subject to late fees, and balances that are not paid in full are subject to interest charges based on a revolving balance. The Company had approximately $62.4 million and $18.9 million of receivables with revolving credit balances as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in revolving credit balances was due to the onboarding of a customer portfolio during 2019.\nAt December 31, 2019, approximately 96 percent of the outstanding balance of $2.7 billion of total trade accounts receivable was 29 days or less past due and approximately 97 percent of the outstanding balance of total trade accounts receivable was 59 days or less past due. The receivables portfolio consists of a large group of homogeneous smaller balances across a wide range of industries. No one customer receivable balance represented 10 percent or more of the outstanding receivables balance at December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018.\nOur short-term cash requirements consist primarily of funding the working capital needs of our business, payments on maturities and withdrawals of brokered deposits and borrowed federal funds, required capital expenditures, repayments on our credit facility, interest payments on our credit facility and other operating expenses. WEX Bank can fund our short-term domestic cash requirements through the issuance of brokered deposits and borrowed federal funds. Any remaining cash needs are primarily funded through operations, our borrowings under our 2016 Credit Agreement, our participation debt and our accounts receivable factoring and securitization arrangements. Our long-term cash requirements consist primarily of amounts owed on our 2016 Credit Agreement and Notes and various facilities lease agreements.\nUndistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company amounted to $77.4 million and $64.9 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. As discussed in Item 8 - Note 14, Income Taxes, the United States enacted the 2017 Tax Act in December 2017, which impacted foreign undistributed earnings, among other things. Upon distribution of these earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to withholding taxes payable, where applicable, to foreign countries, but would generally have no further federal income tax liability. The Company's primary tax jurisdictions are the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom.\nEarnings outside of the United States are accompanied by certain financial risks, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may reduce the reported value of our foreign currency revenues, net of expenses and cash flows. We cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates, the impact of currency exchange rate changes nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes.\nDeposits and Borrowed Federal Funds\nWEX Bank issues certificates of deposit in various maturities ranging between 4 months and five years, with interest rates ranging from 1.80 percent to 3.52 percent as of December 31, 2019, as compared to interest rates ranging from 1.30 percent to 3.52 percent as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $979.4 million of certificates of deposit outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 2.57 percent, compared to $850.8 million of certificates of deposit outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 2.36 percent as of December 31, 2018.\nWEX Bank also issues interest-bearing brokered money market deposits with variable interest rates ranging from 1.63 percent to 1.90 percent as of December 31, 2019, as compared to variable interest rates ranging from 2.48 percent to 2.53 percent as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $362.2 million of interest-bearing brokered money market deposits at a weighted average interest rate of 1.88 percent, as compared to $283.8 million of interest-bearing brokered money market deposits at a weighted average interest rate of 2.49 percent as of December 31, 2018.\nWEX Bank may issue additional brokered deposits without limitation, subject to FDIC rules governing minimum financial ratios, which include risk-based asset and capital requirements. As of December 31, 2019, all brokered deposits were in denominations of $250 thousand or less, corresponding to FDIC deposit insurance limits. Interest-bearing money market funds may be withdrawn at any time. We believe that our brokered deposits are paying competitive yields and that there continues to be consumer demand for these instruments.\nWe also carry non-interest bearing deposits that are required for certain customers as collateral for their credit accounts. We had $112.6 million and $138.1 million of these deposits on hand at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWEX Bank is required to maintain reserves against a percentage of certain customer deposits by keeping balances with the Federal Reserve Bank. The required reserve based on the outstanding customer deposits was $24.9 million and $11.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWEX Bank also borrows from uncommitted federal funds lines of credit to supplement the financing of our accounts receivable. Our federal funds lines of credit were $355.0 million and $309.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with $35.0 million of borrowings as of December 31, 2019 and no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2018.\nWEX Bank participates in the ICS service offered by Promontory Interfinancial Network, which allows WEX Bank to purchase brokered money market demand accounts and demand deposit accounts in an amount not to exceed $125.0 million as part of a one-way buy program. At December 31, 2018, no amounts were available under this arrangement. Subsequently, the funding capacity of $125.0 million was reinstated. At December 31, 2019, there was no outstanding balance for ICS purchases.\n2016 Credit Agreement\nOn July 1, 2016, we entered into the 2016 Credit Agreement in order to permit the additional financing necessary to facilitate the EFS acquisition. The 2016 Credit Agreement initially provided for secured tranche A and tranche B term loan facilities in original principal amounts equal to $455.0 million and $1,200.0 million, respectively, and a $470.0 million secured revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2019, after giving effect to amendments prior to such date, we had an outstanding principal amount of $923.7 million on our secured tranche A term loan, an outstanding principal amount of $1,457.0 million on our secured tranche B term loan and amounts available consisting of an $820.0 million secured revolving credit facility, with a $250.0 million sublimit for letters of credit and $20.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. The tranche B term loans mature during May 2026 while the revolving credit facility and tranche A term loans mature during July 2023, subject to earlier maturity in August 2022 in certain circumstances. The revolving credit loans and tranche A term loans bear interest at variable rates, at the Company's option, plus an applicable margin determined based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio, testing consolidated funded indebtedness (excluding (i) up to $350.0 million of consolidated funded indebtedness due to permitted securitization transactions and (ii) the amount of consolidated funded indebtedness constituting the non-recourse portion of permitted factoring transactions, netting up to $125.0 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents denominated in U.S. dollars held by the Company and its subsidiaries) to consolidated EBITDA. The tranche B term loans bear interest at a variable rate plus a margin equal to 1.25 percent for base rate loans and 2.25 percent for eurocurrency rate loans. Under the 2016 Credit Agreement, the Company has granted a security interest in certain assets of the Company, subject to exceptions including the assets of WEX Bank.\nIncremental loans of up to the greater of $375.0 million (plus the amount of certain prepayments) and an unlimited amount subject to satisfaction of the above-described consolidated leverage ratio test could be made available under the 2016 Credit Agreement upon the request of the Company subject to specified terms and conditions, including receipt of lender commitments. Proceeds from the 2016 Credit Agreement may be used for working capital purposes, acquisitions, payment of dividends and other restricted payments, refinancing of indebtedness and other general corporate purposes.\nThe 2016 Credit Agreement contains various financial covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios. In addition to the financial covenants, the 2016 Credit Agreement contains various customary restrictive covenants including restrictions in certain situations on the payment of dividends. WEX Bank is not subject to certain of these restrictions. We were in compliance with all material covenants and restrictions at December 31, 2019.\nThe Company entered into an Eighth Amendment to the 2016 Credit Agreement on February 10, 2020. For a description of the Eighth Amendment to the 2016 Credit Agreement, see Other Liquidity Matters below.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings against our $820.0 million revolving credit facility. The combined outstanding debt under our tranche A term loan facility and our tranche B term loan facility totaled $2.4 billion at December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, amounts outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement bore a weighted average effective interest rate of 4.0 percent.\nSee Item 8 - Note 16, Financing and Other Debt, for further information regarding interest rates, voluntary prepayments rights and principal payments required under the 2016 Credit Agreement.\nNotes Outstanding\nOn January 30, 2013, the Company completed an offering in an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million of 4.750 percent senior notes. Such Notes mature on February 1, 2023. The Company may optionally redeem the Notes at any time prior to February 1, 2021, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100.792 percent (expressed as a percentage of principal amount of the Notes). At any time after February 1, 2021, the Notes can be redeemed at the option of WEX without penalty.\nWEX Latin America Debt\nWEX Latin America had debt of approximately $2.7 million and $16.2 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This is comprised of credit facilities held in Brazil and loan arrangements related to our accounts receivable, with various maturity dates. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the effective interest rates were 35.04% and 23.59%, respectively.\nParticipation Debt\nFrom time to time, WEX Bank enters into participation agreements with third-party banks to fund customer balances that exceed WEX Bank's lending limit to individual customers. Associated unsecured borrowings carry a variable interest rate of 1 month to 3 month LIBOR plus a margin of 225 basis points. The following table provides the amounts outstanding and the remaining funding capacity under the participation debt agreements in place:\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Amounts Available (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amounts Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Remaining Funding Capacity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amounts Available(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amounts Outstanding(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Remaining Funding Capacity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, net\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Amounts available and outstanding under agreement terminating on August 31, 2020 as to $50 million and on demand as to $30 million.\n(2) Amounts available under agreements terminating on June 30, 2019 and August 31, 2020 as to $50 million each, and on demand as to $80 million. Amounts outstanding under agreements terminating on demand as to $14.8 million and on June 30, 2019 and August 31, 2020 as to $50 million each.\nAustralian Securitization Facility\nThe Company maintains a securitized debt agreement with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., which has been extended through April 2020. Under the terms of the agreement, each month, on a revolving basis, the Company sells certain of its Australian receivables to the Company's Australian Securitization Subsidiary. The Australian Securitization Subsidiary, in turn, uses the receivables as collateral to issue asset-backed commercial paper ( securitized debt\u201d) for approximately 85 percent of the securitized receivables. The amount collected on the securitized receivables is restricted to pay the securitized debt and is not available for general corporate purposes.\nThe Company pays a variable interest rate on the outstanding balance of the securitized debt, based on the Australian Bank Bill Rate plus an applicable margin. The interest rate was 1.80 percent and 2.89 percent as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company had securitized debt under this facility of approximately $78.6 million and $87.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nEuropean Securitization Facility\nOn April 7, 2016, the Company entered into a five-year securitized debt agreement with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company sells certain of its receivables from selected European countries to our European Securitization Subsidiary. The European Securitization Subsidiary, in turn, uses the receivables as collateral to issue securitized debt. The amount collected on the securitized receivables is restricted to pay the securitized debt and is not available for general corporate purposes. The interest rate was 0.63 percent and 0.98 percent as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The Company had $25.7 million and $18.0 million of securitized debt under this facility as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nWEX Latin America Securitization of Receivables\nWEX Latin America entered into a securitized agreement to transfer certain unsecured receivables associated with our salary advanced payment card product to an investment fund managed by an unrelated third-party. The agreement has no set expiration date but either party may terminate the arrangement with 90 day advance written notice. As of December 31, 2018, the securitization arrangement meets the derecognition conditions under US GAAP and transfers under this arrangement are treated as sales and are accounted for as a reduction in trade receivables.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company sold approximately $78.0 million and $39.8 million of receivables, and recognized $16.1 million and $6.9 million of gains on the sale of receivables, respectively. The gains on the sale of receivables equal the difference between the sales price and the carrying value of the receivables, which is recorded within other revenue in our consolidated income statement. Cash proceeds from the transfer of these receivables is reflected as an operating activity within our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nWEX Bank Accounts Receivable Factoring\nWEX Bank has entered into a receivables purchase agreement with an unrelated third-party financial institution to sell certain of our trade accounts receivable under non-recourse transactions through July 31, 2020, after which the agreement can be renewed for successive one-year periods assuming WEX provides advance written notice that is accepted by the purchaser. WEX\nBank continues to service the receivables post-transfer with no participating interest. The Company obtained a true-sale opinion from an independent attorney, which states that the factoring agreement provides legal isolation upon WEX Bank bankruptcy or receivership under local law. As such, transfers under this arrangement are treated as a sale. Proceeds from the sale are reported net of a negotiated discount rate and are accounted for as a reduction in trade receivables because the agreements transfer effective control of the receivables to the buyer.\nThe Company sold approximately $14.8 billion and $3.2 billion of trade accounts receivable under this arrangement during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Proceeds from the sale, which are reported net of a negotiated discount rate, are recorded in operating activities within the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows. The loss on factoring was $3.7 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWEX Europe Services Accounts Receivable Factoring\nWEX Europe Services has entered into a factoring arrangement with an unrelated third-party financial institution (the Purchasing Bank\u201d) to sell certain of its accounts receivable through December 31, 2020 in order to accelerate the collection of the Company's cash and reduce internal costs, thereby improving liquidity. Under this arrangement, the Purchasing Bank establishes a credit limit for each customer account. The factored receivables are without recourse to the extent that the customer balances are maintained at or below the established credit limit. For customer receivable balances in excess of the Purchasing Bank's credit limit, the Company maintains the risk of default. The Company obtained a true sale opinion from an independent attorney, which states that the factoring agreement creates a sale of receivables under local law for amounts transferred both below and above the established credit limits. The Company continues to service these receivables post-transfer with no participating interest. As a result, the Purchasing Bank is deemed the purchaser of these receivables and is entitled to enforce payment of these amounts from the debtor.\nThis factoring arrangement is accounted for as a sale and accordingly the Company records the receivables sold as a reduction of accounts receivable and proceeds as cash provided by operating activities. The Company sold approximately $630.3 million and $713.8 million of receivables under this arrangement during years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Charge-backs on balances in excess of the credit limit during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were insignificant.\nOther Liquidity Matters\nAt December 31, 2019, we had variable-rate borrowings of $2.4 billion under our 2016 Credit Agreement. We periodically review our projected borrowings under our 2016 Credit Agreement and the current interest rate environment in order to ascertain whether interest rate swaps should be used to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility. As of December 31, 2019, we maintained seven interest rate swap contracts that mature between December 2020 and March 2023. Collectively, these derivative contracts are intended to fix the future interest payments associated with $1.44 billion of our variable rate borrowings at between 1.108 percent to 2.425 percent. See Item 8 - Note 12, Derivative Instruments, Item 8 - Note 19, Fair Value, for more information.\nOn January 24, 2020, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to purchase eNett, a leading provider of business-to-business payments solutions to the travel industry and Optal, a company that specializes in optimizing business-to-business transactions. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the Company will acquire all of the issued share capital of eNett and Optal from Travelport Limited, Toro Private Holdings I, Ltd., and the other shareholders of eNett and Optal, for an aggregate purchase price comprised of approximately $1.3 billion in cash and 2,002,450 shares of the Company's common stock and subject to certain working capital and other adjustments as described in the purchase agreement. The parties' obligations to consummate the acquisition are subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. We expect that the acquisition will accelerate our global growth strategy and strengthen our technology and product portfolio, among others. This acquisition will be accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.\nIn connection with the acquisition, the Company entered into a commitment letter with Bank of America, N.A. and BofA Securities, Inc. on January 24, 2020 for (a) senior secured credit facilities in the aggregate amount of up to $2.8 billion, consisting of (i) up to a $2.0 billion seven-year term loan B facility, comprised of $1.1 billion to fund the planned acquisition and a $924.0 million backstop to refinance the Company's existing Term A loans under the 2016 Credit Agreement and (ii) an $820.0 million backstop to replace the Company's existing revolving credit facility under the 2016 Credit Agreement and (b) a senior unsecured bridge facility in the aggregate amount of up to $300.0 million. To the extent that the 2016 Credit Agreement had not been amended prior to the funding of these facilities to increase the maximum consolidated leverage ratio upon the closing of the acquisition to 5.75x, the backstops were available to the Company for use.\nOn February 10, 2020, the Company entered into an Eighth Amendment to the 2016 Credit Agreement. The Eighth Amendment, among other things, (i) modifies the maximum consolidated leverage ratio to be no more than 5.75 to 1.0 commencing as of December 31, 2019, decreasing to 5.50 to 1.0 commencing as of December 31, 2020, decreasing to 5.00 to 1.0 commencing\nas of December 31, 2021 and further decreasing to 4.75 to 1.0 commencing as of December 31, 2022 and thereafter and (ii) increases the Company's capacity to incur additional incremental debt facilities up to $1.4 billion in connection with the acquisition of eNett and Optal. As such, the portion of the commitment related to the backstops described above have been reduced to zero. The amendments set forth in the Eighth Amendment would only become effective concurrently with the closing of the pending acquisition of eNett and Optal, if it occurs.\nThe Company's long-term cash requirements consist primarily of amounts owed on the 2016 Credit Agreement, the Notes and various facility lease agreements. To the extent the senior secured facilities are funded in connection with the eNett and Optal acquisition, the Company's long-term cash requirements will also consist of amounts owed under these facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $51.3 million in letters of credit outstanding and $768.7 million in remaining borrowing capacity under the 2016 Credit Agreement, subject to the covenants as described above.\nWe currently have authorization from our board of directors to purchase up to $150 million of our common stock until September 2021, which is entirely unused as of December 31, 2019. The program is funded either through our future cash flows or through borrowings on our 2016 Credit Agreement. Share repurchases are made on the open market and may be commenced or suspended at any time. The Company's management, based on its evaluation of market and economic conditions and other factors, determines the timing and number of shares repurchased.\nContractual Obligations\nThe table below summarizes the estimated amounts of payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Lease Obligations(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loans\n</td> <td>2,380,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>803,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,383,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on term loans(b)\n</td> <td>482,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$400 million notes offering\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on $400 million notes offering\n</td> <td>58,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on certificates of deposit\n</td> <td>16,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other debt(c)\n</td> <td>52,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowed federal funds\n</td> <td>34,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securitization facility(d)\n</td> <td>104,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Certificates of deposit\n</td> <td>979,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>835,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing money market deposits\n</td> <td>362,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>362,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Penalties on minimum volume purchase commitments(e)\n</td> <td>49,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(f)\n</td> <td>28,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,048,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,610,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>556,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,378,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,503,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Operating lease obligations - Represents undiscounted cash flows for remaining lease payments under long-term operating leases for office space.

See Item 8 - Note 16, Financing and Other Debt, for more information.\n(c) Other debt - This amount includes participation debt at WEX Bank and debt balances at one of the Company's subsidiaries. Interest payments due were not included as the amount was not material.\n(d) Securitization facility - Interest payments due on the securitization facility are not included as the amount was not material.\n(e) Minimum volume purchase commitments - Two of the Company's subsidiaries are required to purchase a minimum amount of fuel from suppliers on an annual basis. If the minimum requirement is not fulfilled, they are subject to penalties based on the amount of spend below the minimum annual volume commitment. The table above represents the Company's annual penalty assuming we purchase no fuel under these commitments after December 31, 2019.\n(f) Other - Includes amounts due under the Company's tax receivable agreement, cloud platform services agreement, operating leases for vehicles and equipment, minimum spend commitments toward information technology contracts and liquidated damages due if the Company were to cancel certain contracts negotiated with hotels for future years' conferences and events. See Item 8 - Note 17, Tax Receivable Agreement, for more information regarding the tax receivable agreement.\nThe Company has excluded $10.3 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits which have been excluded from the table above. $5.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits are classified within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as no reliable estimates can be made on the timing of payments to taxing authorities. The remaining gross unrecognized tax benefits are classified within prepaid assets and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet, reducing an income tax receivable.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn addition to the operating leases included in the table above, we have the following off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Extension of credit to customers - We have entered into commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of business.

These amounts may increase or decrease during 2020 as we increase or decrease credit to customers, subject to appropriate credit reviews, as part of our lending product agreements. Many of these commitments are not expected to be utilized. We can adjust most of our customers' credit lines at our discretion at any time. Therefore, we do not believe total unused credit available to customers and customers of strategic relationships represents future cash requirements.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussion below focuses on the factors affecting our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and financial condition at December 31, 2019 and 2018 and, where appropriate, factors that may affect our future financial performance, unless stated otherwise. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, notes to the consolidated financial statements and selected consolidated financial data.\nOur Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A is presented in the following sections:\n \u2022 2019 Highlights and Year in Review \n \u2022 Recent Events \n \u2022 Segments \n \u2022 Results of Operations \n \u2022 Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n \u2022 New Accounting Standards \n \u2022 Liquidity, Capital Resources and Cash Flows  2019 Highlights and Year in Review\nThe following events and accomplishments occurred during 2019:\n \u2022 Contributions from all three of our segments resulted in the Company reaching approximately $1.7 billion in annual revenues in 2019, 15 percent growth relative to the prior year. \n \u2022 On July 1, 2019, the Company acquired Go Fuel Card, a European fuel card, for a total purchase price of \u20ac235.0 million (equivalent of $266.0 million on date of purchase). The acquisition strengthens our position in the European market, grows our existing customer base and reduces our sensitivity to retail fuel prices. \n \u2022 The Company converted the acquired Chevron fleet customer portfolio onto our payment processing platform during second quarter of 2019. \n \u2022 On March 5, 2019, the Company acquired Discovery Benefits, an employee benefits administrator, for a total purchase price of $526.1 million, of which $50.0 million was paid during the fourth quarter of 2019. State Bankshares, Inc., the seller of Discovery Benefits, obtained a 4.9 percent equity interest in the newly formed parent company of WEX Health and Discovery Benefits, which constitutes the U.S. Health business. This acquisition provides our partners and customers with a more comprehensive suite of products and services and opens go-to-market channels to include consulting firms and brokers. \n \u2022 On February 14, 2019, the Company acquired Pavestone Capital, a recourse factoring company that provides working capital to businesses, for a total purchase price of $29.0 million. Pavestone Capital complements our existing factoring business. \n \u2022 On January 24, 2019, the Company acquired Noventis, an electronic payments network focused on optimizing payment delivery for bills and invoices to commercial entities, for $338.7 million. This acquisition expands our reach as a corporate payments supplier and provides more channels to billing aggregators and financial institutions. \n \u2022 The Company successfully executed three separate amendments of our 2016 Credit Agreement in 2019, which among other things, increased the outstanding amounts under our term loans by $700.0 million and increased our commitments under the revolving credit facility by $100 million. In addition, we extended the maturity on term B loans to May 2026.  Our Company's management regularly monitors key metrics in order to measure our current performance and project future performance. Management believes the following metrics, many of which are discussed in more detail later in this section, were important to our overall performance in 2019 as they provide enhanced information and data underlying our financial results:\n \u2022 Average number of vehicles serviced increased 19 percent from 2018 to approximately 14.0 million for 2019, primarily related to growth in our worldwide customer base. As of December 31, 2019, vehicles serviced totaled 14.9 million. \n \u2022 Total fuel transactions processed increased 11 percent from 2018 to 612.4 million in 2019 due primarily to organic growth in North America, including impacts of two large customer migrations. Total payment processing transactions increased 10 percent from 2018 to 505.3 million in 2019, and transaction processing transactions increased 15 percent from 2018 to 107.1 million in 2019. \n \u2022 The average U.S. fuel price per gallon during 2019 was $2.80, a 5 percent decrease as compared to the prior year. \n \u2022 Credit loss expense in the Fleet Solutions segment increased 10 percent to $59.8 million during 2019, as compared to $54.5 million during 2018. Our credit losses were 15.1 basis points of fuel expenditures for 2019, as compared to 12.5 basis points of fuel expenditures for 2018, an increase of 21 percent primarily due to higher losses in the small fleet over-the-road business as compared to 2018. \n \u2022 Our Travel and Corporate Solutions purchase volume grew to $39.6 billion in 2019, a 14 percent increase from 2018, primarily due to strong domestic growth in our corporate payment product and worldwide gains in our travel product. \n \u2022 Health and Employee Benefit Solutions average number of SaaS accounts in the U.S. grew 17% to 12.9 million in 2019 from 11.0 million in 2018. Likewise, U.S. purchase volume grew by $391.9 million in 2019, an 8 percent increase as compared to 2018. \n \u2022 Our effective tax rate was 28.3 percent for 2019 as compared to 28.9 percent for 2018. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the jurisdictional earnings mix.  Recent Events\nOn January 24, 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement to purchase eNett, a leading provider of business-to-business payments solutions to the travel industry and Optal, a company that specializes in optimizing business-to-business transactions. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, WEX will acquire all of the issued share capital of eNett and Optal from Travelport Limited, Toro Private Holdings I, Ltd., and the other shareholders of eNett and Optal, for an aggregate purchase price comprised of approximately $1.3 billion in cash and 2.0 million shares of the Company's common stock and subject to certain working capital and other adjustments as described in the purchase agreement. The parties' obligations to consummate the acquisition are subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.\nSegments\nWEX operates in three reportable segments: Fleet Solutions, Travel and Corporate Solutions, and Health and Employee Benefit Solutions. Our Fleet Solutions segment provides payment, transaction processing and information management services specifically designed for the needs of commercial and government fleets. Our Travel and Corporate Solutions segment focuses on the complex payment environment of business-to-business payments, providing customers with payment processing solutions for their corporate payment and transaction monitoring needs. Our Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment provides a SaaS platform for consumer directed healthcare payments, as well as payroll related benefits to customers in Brazil.\nResults of Operations\nThe Company does not allocate foreign currency gains and losses, financing interest expense, unrealized and realized gains and losses on financial instruments, income taxes, net gains or losses from non-controlling interests, and non-cash adjustments related to our tax receivable agreement to our operating segments, as management believes these items are unpredictable and can obscure underlying trends. In addition, the Company does not allocate certain corporate expenses to our operating segments, as these items are centrally controlled and are not directly attributable to any reportable segment.\nSources of Operating Expense\nCost of Services\n \u2022 Processing costs - The Company's processing costs consist of expenses related to processing transactions, servicing customers and merchants and cost of goods sold related to hardware and other product sales. \n \u2022 Service fees - The Company incurs costs from third-party networks utilized to deliver payment solutions. Additionally, other third-parties are utilized in performing services directly related to generating revenue. \n \u2022 Provision for credit losses - Changes in the reserve for credit loss are the result of changes in management's estimate of the losses in the Company's outstanding portfolio of receivables, including losses from fraud. \n \u2022 Operating interest - The Company incurs interest expense on the operating debt obtained to provide liquidity for its short-term receivables. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization - The Company has identified those tangible and intangible assets directly associated with providing a service that generates revenue and records the depreciation and amortization associated with those assets under this category. Such assets include processing platforms and related infrastructure, acquired developed technology intangible assets and other similar asset types.  Other Operating Expenses\n \u2022 General and administrative - General and administrative includes compensation and related expenses for executive, finance and accounting, other information technology, human resources, legal and other corporate functions. Also included are corporate facilities expenses, certain third-party professional service fees and other corporate expenses. \n \u2022 Sales and marketing - The Company's sales and marketing expenses relate primarily to compensation, benefits, sales commissions and related expenses for sales, marketing and other related activities. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization - The depreciation and amortization associated with tangible and intangible assets that are not considered to be directly associated with providing a service that generates revenue are recorded as other operating expenses. Such assets include corporate facilities and information technology assets and acquired intangible assets other than those included in cost of services. \nYear Ended December 31, 2019, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nFleet Solutions\nRevenues\nThe following table reflects comparative revenue and key operating statistics within Fleet Solutions:\n\n(a) The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced Fleet Solutions revenue by $7.3 million in 2019, compared to the prior year.\n(1) Payment processing transactions represents the total number of purchases made by fleets that have a payment processing relationship with WEX.\n(2) Payment processing fuel spend represents the total dollar value of the fuel purchased by fleets that have a payment processing relationship with WEX.\n(3) Net payment processing rate represents the percentage of the dollar value of each payment processing transaction that WEX records as revenue from merchants less certain discounts given to customers and network fees.\nRevenues\nPayment processing revenue decreased $7.7 million for 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to lower average fuel prices in North America and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. These unfavorable impacts were almost entirely offset by higher payment processing volumes and the acquisition of the Go Fuel Card business. Over half of the late fee and volume increases were due to the onboarding of two major North American oil portfolios.\nAccount servicing revenue in 2019 was generally consistent with account servicing revenue in 2018.\nFinance fee revenue is comprised of the following components:\n\nFinance income primarily consists of late fees and interest charged for receivables not paid within the terms of the customer agreement based upon the outstanding customer receivable balance. This revenue is earned when a customer's receivable balance becomes delinquent and is calculated using the greater of a minimum charge or a stated late fee rate multiplied by the outstanding balance that is subject to a late fee charge. Changes in the absolute amount of such outstanding balances can be attributed, including, but not limited to (i) changes in fuel prices; (ii) customer specific transaction volume; and (iii) customer specific delinquencies. Late fee revenue can also be impacted by (i) changes in late fee rates and (ii) increases or decreases in customer overdue balances. Late fee rates are determined and set based primarily on the risk associated with our customers, coupled with a strategic view of standard rates within our industry. Periodically, we assess the market rates associated within our industry to determine appropriate late fee rates. We consider factors such as the Company's overall financial model and strategic plan, the cost to our business from\ncustomers failing to pay timely and the impact such late payments have on our financial results. These assessments are typically conducted at least annually but may occur more often depending on macro-economic factors.\nFinance income increased $55.5 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily attributable to customer acquisitions and higher weighted average late fee rates in near equal proportions, partly offset by lower average customer receivables as a result of the decline in domestic price per gallon. For the majority of 2019, monthly late fee rates and minimum finance charges ranged up to 9.99 percent and $75, respectively, as compared to monthly late fee rates and minimum finance charges of up to 7.99 percent and $75, respectively, during 2018. The weighted average late fee rate, net of related charge-offs was 5.4 percent and 4.5 percent for 2019 and 2018, respectively. Concessions to certain customers experiencing financial difficulties may be granted and are limited to extending the time to pay, placing a customer on a payment plan or granting waivers of late fees. There were no material concessions to customers experiencing financial difficulties during either of 2019 or 2018.\nThe primary source of factoring fee revenue is calculated as a negotiated percentage fee of the receivable balance that we purchase. A secondary source of factoring fee revenue is a flat rate service fee to our customers that request a non-contractual same day funding of the receivable balance. Factoring fee revenue for 2019 was generally consistent with 2018.\nOther revenue increased $14.4 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to increased fees associated with growth in vehicles serviced.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table compares line items within operating income for Fleet Solutions:\n\nCost of services\nProcessing costs increased $14.9 million for 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to higher expenses associated with the onboarding of customer acquisitions.\nService fees for 2019 were generally consistent with service fees in in 2018.\nProvision for credit losses increased $5.3 million for 2019, as compared to 2018 due to an increase in credit losses related to smaller customers in our over-the-road business, partly offset by lower fraud losses.\nWe generally measure our credit loss performance by calculating fuel-related credit losses as a percentage of total fuel expenditures on payment processing transactions. This metric for credit losses was 15.1 basis points of fuel expenditures for 2019, as compared to 12.5 basis points of fuel expenditures for 2018. We generally use a roll-rate methodology to calculate the amount necessary for our ending receivable reserve balance. This methodology considers total receivable balances, recent charge-off experience, recoveries on previously charged off accounts, and the dollars that are delinquent to calculate the total reserve. In addition, management undertakes a detailed evaluation of the receivable balances to help further ensure overall reserve adequacy. The expense we recognize in each quarter is the amount necessary to bring the reserve to its required level based on accounts receivable aging and net charge offs.\nOperating interest expense increased $5.6 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher interest rates paid on deposits and volume growth.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $3.9 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to the amortization of merchant networks obtained in the Go Fuel Card acquisition.\nOther operating expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $7.3 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to acquisition-related costs during 2019 and higher stock-based compensation associated with the Company's performance.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $10.9 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to an increase in personnel-related costs resulting from higher volumes and financial performance, as well as higher marketing costs related to significant 2019 customer acquisitions.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $5.0 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to the amortization of the Chevron customer portfolio intangible asset and customer relationships obtained in the Go Fuel Card acquisition. This increase was partly offset by lower amortization expense on intangible assets related to acquisitions from prior periods.\nDuring our annual goodwill assessment completed in the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $3.2 million for our Brazil fleet reporting unit. See Item 8 - Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, of our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nTravel and Corporate Solutions\nRevenues\nThe following table reflects comparative revenue and key operating statistics within Travel and Corporate Solutions:\n\n(a) The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced Travel and Corporate Solutions revenue by $4.5 million in 2019, compared to the prior year.\n(1) Payment solutions purchase volume represents the total dollar value of all WEX-issued transactions that use WEX corporate card products and virtual card products.\nPayment processing revenue increased $100.1 million for 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to a 2019 contract amendment, the acquisition of Noventis and volume related increases. The increase was partly offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The contract amendment resulted in an increase in payment processing revenue, with an offsetting reduction in other revenue.\nAccount servicing revenue increased $6.0 million for 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to the acquisition of Noventis and higher SaaS licensing fees earned on our accounts receivable and accounts payable platforms.\nFinance fee revenue was not material to Travel and Corporate Solutions' operations in 2019 or 2018. Concessions to certain customers experiencing financial difficulties may be granted and are limited to extending the time to pay, placing a customer on a payment plan or granting waivers of late fees. There were no material concessions to customers experiencing financial difficulties during either 2019 or 2018.\nOther revenue decreased $42.3 million for 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to the recent contract amendment discussed in payment processing revenue above.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table compares line items within operating income for Travel and Corporate Solutions:\n\nCost of services\nProcessing costs increased $17.2 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to the acquisition of Noventis and volume related increases.\nService fees in 2019, were generally consistent with service fees in 2018, as benefits resulting from the onboarding of transactions to an internal processing platform were offset by the impact of higher volumes.\nProvision for credit losses decreased $1.4 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, resulting from recoveries on amounts previously charged-off and the absence of a discrete customer reserve taken during 2018.\nOperating interest increased $3.2 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher interest rates paid on deposits and volume growth.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased $1.8 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to the amortization of software obtained in the Noventis acquisition, partly offset by lower amortization expense on intangible assets related to acquisitions from prior periods.\nOther operating expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $10.0 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to costs associated with the Noventis acquisition including the expense incurred to accelerate vesting of options awards.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $11.0 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher relative commission payments to partners and the Noventis acquisition.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $3.3 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to higher amortization on customer relationships obtained as part of the Noventis acquisition.\nDuring 2018, we recognized a $2.4 million non-cash impairment charge to write-off certain property and equipment.\nHealth and Employee Benefit Solutions\nRevenues\nThe following table reflects comparative revenue and key operating statistics within Health and Employee Benefit Solutions:\n\n(a)The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced Health and Employee Benefit Solutions revenue by $1.3 million in 2019, as compared to the prior year.\n(1) Purchase volume represents the total US dollar value of all transactions where interchange is earned by WEX.\n(2) Average number of SaaS accounts represents the number of active Consumer Directed Health, COBRA, and billing accounts on our SaaS platforms in the US.\nPayment processing revenue increased $9.2 million for 2019, as compared to 2018, resulting primarily from the acquisition of Discovery Benefits.\nAccount servicing revenue increased $97.4 million for 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to the acquisition of Discovery Benefits and existing WEX Health customer growth, which resulted in a higher number of participants using our SaaS healthcare technology platform and higher revenue earned on HSA assets.\nFinance fee revenue decreased $16.6 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to the accounting impact of our WEX Latin America securitization arrangement, as discussed further below.\nOther revenue increased $13.3 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to realized gains on the sale of WEX Latin America customer receivables under a securitization arrangement. Prior to an amendment of this securitization arrangement during the third quarter of 2018, the revenue associated with these customer receivables was primarily included in finance fee revenue. The increase in other revenue was also attributable to growth in ancillary services to cardholders as a result of the increased number of SaaS platform participants and HSA assets. The acquisition of Discovery Benefits also contributed to the increase in other revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table compares line items within operating income for Health and Employee Benefit Solutions:\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussion below focuses on the factors affecting our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and financial condition at December 31, 2019 and 2018 and, where appropriate, factors that may affect our future financial performance, unless stated otherwise. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, notes to the consolidated financial statements and selected consolidated financial data.\nOur Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A is presented in the following sections:\n \u2022 2019 Highlights and Year in Review \n \u2022 Recent Events \n \u2022 Segments \n \u2022 Results of Operations \n \u2022 Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n \u2022 New Accounting Standards \n \u2022 Liquidity, Capital Resources and Cash Flows  2019 Highlights and Year in Review\nThe following events and accomplishments occurred during 2019:\n \u2022 Contributions from all three of our segments resulted in the Company reaching approximately $1.7 billion in annual revenues in 2019, 15 percent growth relative to the prior year. \n \u2022 On July 1, 2019, the Company acquired Go Fuel Card, a European fuel card, for a total purchase price of \u20ac235.0 million (equivalent of $266.0 million on date of purchase). The acquisition strengthens our position in the European market, grows our existing customer base and reduces our sensitivity to retail fuel prices. \n \u2022 The Company converted the acquired Chevron fleet customer portfolio onto our payment processing platform during second quarter of 2019. \n \u2022 On March 5, 2019, the Company acquired Discovery Benefits, an employee benefits administrator, for a total purchase price of $526.1 million, of which $50.0 million was paid during the fourth quarter of 2019. State Bankshares, Inc., the seller of Discovery Benefits, obtained a 4.9 percent equity interest in the newly formed parent company of WEX Health and Discovery Benefits, which constitutes the U.S. Health business. This acquisition provides our partners and customers with a more comprehensive suite of products and services and opens go-to-market channels to include consulting firms and brokers. \n \u2022 On February 14, 2019, the Company acquired Pavestone Capital, a recourse factoring company that provides working capital to businesses, for a total purchase price of $29.0 million. Pavestone Capital complements our existing factoring business. \n \u2022 On January 24, 2019, the Company acquired Noventis, an electronic payments network focused on optimizing payment delivery for bills and invoices to commercial entities, for $338.7 million. This acquisition expands our reach as a corporate payments supplier and provides more channels to billing aggregators and financial institutions. \n \u2022 The Company successfully executed three separate amendments of our 2016 Credit Agreement in 2019, which among other things, increased the outstanding amounts under our term loans by $700.0 million and increased our commitments under the revolving credit facility by $100 million. In addition, we extended the maturity on term B loans to May 2026.  Our Company's management regularly monitors key metrics in order to measure our current performance and project future performance. Management believes the following metrics, many of which are discussed in more detail later in this section, were important to our overall performance in 2019 as they provide enhanced information and data underlying our financial results:\n \u2022 Average number of vehicles serviced increased 19 percent from 2018 to approximately 14.0 million for 2019, primarily related to growth in our worldwide customer base. As of December 31, 2019, vehicles serviced totaled 14.9 million. \n \u2022 Total fuel transactions processed increased 11 percent from 2018 to 612.4 million in 2019 due primarily to organic growth in North America, including impacts of two large customer migrations. Total payment processing transactions increased 10 percent from 2018 to 505.3 million in 2019, and transaction processing transactions increased 15 percent from 2018 to 107.1 million in 2019. \n \u2022 The average U.S. fuel price per gallon during 2019 was $2.80, a 5 percent decrease as compared to the prior year. \n \u2022 Credit loss expense in the Fleet Solutions segment increased 10 percent to $59.8 million during 2019, as compared to $54.5 million during 2018. Our credit losses were 15.1 basis points of fuel expenditures for 2019, as compared to 12.5 basis points of fuel expenditures for 2018, an increase of 21 percent primarily due to higher losses in the small fleet over-the-road business as compared to 2018. \n \u2022 Our Travel and Corporate Solutions purchase volume grew to $39.6 billion in 2019, a 14 percent increase from 2018, primarily due to strong domestic growth in our corporate payment product and worldwide gains in our travel product. \n \u2022 Health and Employee Benefit Solutions average number of SaaS accounts in the U.S. grew 17% to 12.9 million in 2019 from 11.0 million in 2018. Likewise, U.S. purchase volume grew by $391.9 million in 2019, an 8 percent increase as compared to 2018. \n \u2022 Our effective tax rate was 28.3 percent for 2019 as compared to 28.9 percent for 2018. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the jurisdictional earnings mix.  Recent Events\nOn January 24, 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement to purchase eNett, a leading provider of business-to-business payments solutions to the travel industry and Optal, a company that specializes in optimizing business-to-business transactions. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, WEX will acquire all of the issued share capital of eNett and Optal from Travelport Limited, Toro Private Holdings I, Ltd., and the other shareholders of eNett and Optal, for an aggregate purchase price comprised of approximately $1.3 billion in cash and 2.0 million shares of the Company's common stock and subject to certain working capital and other adjustments as described in the purchase agreement. The parties' obligations to consummate the acquisition are subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.\nSegments\nWEX operates in three reportable segments: Fleet Solutions, Travel and Corporate Solutions, and Health and Employee Benefit Solutions. Our Fleet Solutions segment provides payment, transaction processing and information management services specifically designed for the needs of commercial and government fleets. Our Travel and Corporate Solutions segment focuses on the complex payment environment of business-to-business payments, providing customers with payment processing solutions for their corporate payment and transaction monitoring needs. Our Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment provides a SaaS platform for consumer directed healthcare payments, as well as payroll related benefits to customers in Brazil.\nResults of Operations\nThe Company does not allocate foreign currency gains and losses, financing interest expense, unrealized and realized gains and losses on financial instruments, income taxes, net gains or losses from non-controlling interests, and non-cash adjustments related to our tax receivable agreement to our operating segments, as management believes these items are unpredictable and can obscure underlying trends. In addition, the Company does not allocate certain corporate expenses to our operating segments, as these items are centrally controlled and are not directly attributable to any reportable segment.\nSources of Operating Expense\nCost of Services\n \u2022 Processing costs - The Company's processing costs consist of expenses related to processing transactions, servicing customers and merchants and cost of goods sold related to hardware and other product sales. \n \u2022 Service fees - The Company incurs costs from third-party networks utilized to deliver payment solutions. Additionally, other third-parties are utilized in performing services directly related to generating revenue. \n \u2022 Provision for credit losses - Changes in the reserve for credit loss are the result of changes in management's estimate of the losses in the Company's outstanding portfolio of receivables, including losses from fraud. \n \u2022 Operating interest - The Company incurs interest expense on the operating debt obtained to provide liquidity for its short-term receivables. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization - The Company has identified those tangible and intangible assets directly associated with providing a service that generates revenue and records the depreciation and amortization associated with those assets under this category. Such assets include processing platforms and related infrastructure, acquired developed technology intangible assets and other similar asset types.  Other Operating Expenses\n \u2022 General and administrative - General and administrative includes compensation and related expenses for executive, finance and accounting, other information technology, human resources, legal and other corporate functions. Also included are corporate facilities expenses, certain third-party professional service fees and other corporate expenses. \n \u2022 Sales and marketing - The Company's sales and marketing expenses relate primarily to compensation, benefits, sales commissions and related expenses for sales, marketing and other related activities. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization - The depreciation and amortization associated with tangible and intangible assets that are not considered to be directly associated with providing a service that generates revenue are recorded as other operating expenses. Such assets include corporate facilities and information technology assets and acquired intangible assets other than those included in cost of services. \nYear Ended December 31, 2019, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nFleet Solutions\nRevenues\nThe following table reflects comparative revenue and key operating statistics within Fleet Solutions:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except per transaction and per gallon data)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment processing revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>457,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>464,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,736\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Account servicing revenue\n</td> <td>164,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance fee revenue\n</td> <td>245,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>171,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,038,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>975,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Key operating statistics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment processing revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment processing transactions(1)\n</td> <td>505,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>459,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment processing fuel spend(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,372,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,991,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>380,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average price per gallon of fuel - Domestic - ($USD/gal)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net payment processing rate(3)\n</td> <td>1.22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.04\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced Fleet Solutions revenue by $7.3 million in 2019, compared to the prior year.\n(1) Payment processing transactions represents the total number of purchases made by fleets that have a payment processing relationship with WEX.\n(2) Payment processing fuel spend represents the total dollar value of the fuel purchased by fleets that have a payment processing relationship with WEX.\n(3) Net payment processing rate represents the percentage of the dollar value of each payment processing transaction that WEX records as revenue from merchants less certain discounts given to customers and network fees.\nRevenues\nPayment processing revenue decreased $7.7 million for 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to lower average fuel prices in North America and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. These unfavorable impacts were almost entirely offset by higher payment processing volumes and the acquisition of the Go Fuel Card business. Over half of the late fee and volume increases were due to the onboarding of two major North American oil portfolios.\nAccount servicing revenue in 2019 was generally consistent with account servicing revenue in 2018.\nFinance fee revenue is comprised of the following components:\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>208,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Factoring fee revenue\n</td> <td>36,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(911\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total finance fee revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinance income primarily consists of late fees and interest charged for receivables not paid within the terms of the customer agreement based upon the outstanding customer receivable balance. This revenue is earned when a customer's receivable balance becomes delinquent and is calculated using the greater of a minimum charge or a stated late fee rate multiplied by the outstanding balance that is subject to a late fee charge. Changes in the absolute amount of such outstanding balances can be attributed, including, but not limited to (i) changes in fuel prices; (ii) customer specific transaction volume; and (iii) customer specific delinquencies. Late fee revenue can also be impacted by (i) changes in late fee rates and (ii) increases or decreases in customer overdue balances. Late fee rates are determined and set based primarily on the risk associated with our customers, coupled with a strategic view of standard rates within our industry. Periodically, we assess the market rates associated within our industry to determine appropriate late fee rates. We consider factors such as the Company's overall financial model and strategic plan, the cost to our business from\ncustomers failing to pay timely and the impact such late payments have on our financial results. These assessments are typically conducted at least annually but may occur more often depending on macro-economic factors.\nFinance income increased $55.5 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily attributable to customer acquisitions and higher weighted average late fee rates in near equal proportions, partly offset by lower average customer receivables as a result of the decline in domestic price per gallon. For the majority of 2019, monthly late fee rates and minimum finance charges ranged up to 9.99 percent and $75, respectively, as compared to monthly late fee rates and minimum finance charges of up to 7.99 percent and $75, respectively, during 2018. The weighted average late fee rate, net of related charge-offs was 5.4 percent and 4.5 percent for 2019 and 2018, respectively. Concessions to certain customers experiencing financial difficulties may be granted and are limited to extending the time to pay, placing a customer on a payment plan or granting waivers of late fees. There were no material concessions to customers experiencing financial difficulties during either of 2019 or 2018.\nThe primary source of factoring fee revenue is calculated as a negotiated percentage fee of the receivable balance that we purchase. A secondary source of factoring fee revenue is a flat rate service fee to our customers that request a non-contractual same day funding of the receivable balance. Factoring fee revenue for 2019 was generally consistent with 2018.\nOther revenue increased $14.4 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to increased fees associated with growth in vehicles serviced.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table compares line items within operating income for Fleet Solutions:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Processing costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>205,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Provision for credit losses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating interest\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,225\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>365,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>352,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of services\nProcessing costs increased $14.9 million for 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to higher expenses associated with the onboarding of customer acquisitions.\nService fees for 2019 were generally consistent with service fees in in 2018.\nProvision for credit losses increased $5.3 million for 2019, as compared to 2018 due to an increase in credit losses related to smaller customers in our over-the-road business, partly offset by lower fraud losses.\nWe generally measure our credit loss performance by calculating fuel-related credit losses as a percentage of total fuel expenditures on payment processing transactions. This metric for credit losses was 15.1 basis points of fuel expenditures for 2019, as compared to 12.5 basis points of fuel expenditures for 2018. We generally use a roll-rate methodology to calculate the amount necessary for our ending receivable reserve balance. This methodology considers total receivable balances, recent charge-off experience, recoveries on previously charged off accounts, and the dollars that are delinquent to calculate the total reserve. In addition, management undertakes a detailed evaluation of the receivable balances to help further ensure overall reserve adequacy. The expense we recognize in each quarter is the amount necessary to bring the reserve to its required level based on accounts receivable aging and net charge offs.\nOperating interest expense increased $5.6 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher interest rates paid on deposits and volume growth.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $3.9 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to the amortization of merchant networks obtained in the Go Fuel Card acquisition.\nOther operating expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $7.3 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to acquisition-related costs during 2019 and higher stock-based compensation associated with the Company's performance.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $10.9 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to an increase in personnel-related costs resulting from higher volumes and financial performance, as well as higher marketing costs related to significant 2019 customer acquisitions.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $5.0 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to the amortization of the Chevron customer portfolio intangible asset and customer relationships obtained in the Go Fuel Card acquisition. This increase was partly offset by lower amortization expense on intangible assets related to acquisitions from prior periods.\nDuring our annual goodwill assessment completed in the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $3.2 million for our Brazil fleet reporting unit.

The increase was partly offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The contract amendment resulted in an increase in payment processing revenue, with an offsetting reduction in other revenue.\nAccount servicing revenue increased $6.0 million for 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to the acquisition of Noventis and higher SaaS licensing fees earned on our accounts receivable and accounts payable platforms.\nFinance fee revenue was not material to Travel and Corporate Solutions' operations in 2019 or 2018. Concessions to certain customers experiencing financial difficulties may be granted and are limited to extending the time to pay, placing a customer on a payment plan or granting waivers of late fees. There were no material concessions to customers experiencing financial difficulties during either 2019 or 2018.\nOther revenue decreased $42.3 million for 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to the recent contract amendment discussed in payment processing revenue above.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table compares line items within operating income for Travel and Corporate

</tr>\n</table>\nCost of services\nProcessing costs increased $17.2 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to the acquisition of Noventis and volume related increases.\nService fees in 2019, were generally consistent with service fees in 2018, as benefits resulting from the onboarding of transactions to an internal processing platform were offset by the impact of higher volumes.\nProvision for credit losses decreased $1.4 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, resulting from recoveries on amounts previously charged-off and the absence of a discrete customer reserve taken during 2018.\nOperating interest increased $3.2 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher interest rates paid on deposits and volume growth.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased $1.8 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to the amortization of software obtained in the Noventis acquisition, partly offset by lower amortization expense on intangible assets related to acquisitions from prior periods.\nOther operating expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $10.0 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to costs associated with the Noventis acquisition including the expense incurred to accelerate vesting of options awards.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $11.0 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher relative commission payments to partners and the Noventis acquisition.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $3.3 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to higher amortization on customer relationships obtained as part of the Noventis acquisition.\nDuring 2018, we recognized a $2.4 million non-cash impairment charge to write-off certain property and equipment.\nHealth and Employee Benefit Solutions\nRevenues\nThe following table reflects comparative revenue and key operating statistics within Health and Employee Benefit Solutions:\nTable 134:

accounts represents the number of active Consumer Directed Health, COBRA, and billing accounts on our SaaS platforms in the US.\nPayment processing revenue increased $9.2 million for 2019, as compared to 2018, resulting primarily from the acquisition of Discovery Benefits.\nAccount servicing revenue increased $97.4 million for 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to the acquisition of Discovery Benefits and existing WEX Health customer growth, which resulted in a higher number of participants using our SaaS healthcare technology platform and higher revenue earned on HSA assets.\nFinance fee revenue decreased $16.6 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to the accounting impact of our WEX Latin America securitization arrangement, as discussed further below.\nOther revenue increased $13.3 million in 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to realized gains on the sale of WEX Latin America customer receivables under a securitization arrangement. Prior to an amendment of this securitization arrangement during the third quarter of 2018, the revenue associated with these customer receivables was primarily included in finance fee revenue. The increase in other revenue was also attributable to growth in ancillary services to cardholders as a result of the increased number of SaaS platform participants and HSA assets. The acquisition of Discovery Benefits also contributed to the increase in other revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table compares line items within operating income for Health and Employee Benefit Solutions:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Processing costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for credit losses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,745\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating interest\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,380\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>"}
