We maintain long-standing relationships with many of the largest wireline, wireless and cable companies worldwide. The Company's portfolio includes market-leading solutions and services for real-time analytics, customer acquisition and activation, customer value management and loyalty for the telecom industry promoting partnerships into retail and financial services\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with the prescribed accounting standards for software revenue recognition under generally accepted accounting principles. As a result, our license fees and services revenue fluctuate from period to period as a result of the timing of revenue recognition on existing projects.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nWe reported net income of $2.5 million, $3.4 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOn July 6, 2017 we announced the completion of the previously announced acquisition of Business Logic Systems (\u201cBLS\u201d). BLS, headquartered in Newbury, UK, specializes in data-driven customer value management and customer engagement solutions that have been implemented in over 20 mobile operators in Europe, Africa, Asia-Pacific and the Caribbean. BLS solutions turn customer data into actionable insights and personalized contextual offers. Customer engagement occurs through in-bound and out-bound offers and is further extended through a suite of loyalty and retention solutions.\nOn September 7, 2017 we announced the completion of the acquisition of four business operating units of Lumata Holdings Ltd. (\u201cthe Lumata Entities\u201d). The Lumata Entities are a leading global provider of real-time, next generation loyalty and customer lifecycle management software and services that helps businesses gain value from their customer data for relevant and contextual insights and actions of value to both customers and enterprises. Its customers include mobile operators including Orange, Telefonica and other Tier-1 and emerging operators in Europe and around the world. The acquisition is expected to be accretive to our operations once the integration of the business is completed during 2018.\nOn September 30, 2015 we acquired privately held SSM, now known as Evolving Systems NC, Inc., a provider of real time analytics and marketing solutions to wireless carriers, for an initial payment of approximately $9.75 million and a $0.5 million working capital adjustment. We also agreed to make a payment on the one-year anniversary of the transaction of $250,000, with such payment being available to secure SSM's representations and warranties in the agreement. The final payment has not been made as of the date this Form 10-K was filed due to pending resolution of outstanding claims.\nWe have operations in foreign countries where the local currency is used to prepare the consolidated financial statements which are translated into our reporting currency, U.S. dollars. Changes in the exchange rates between these currencies and our reporting currency are partially responsible for some of the changes from period to period in our financial statement amounts. The majority of the changes in 2017 and 2016 are a result of the U.S. dollar strengthening on average versus the British Pound Sterling. The chart below summarizes what the effects on our revenue and expenses would be on a constant currency basis. The constant currency basis assumes that the exchange rate was constant for the periods presented (in thousands).\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (203\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (753\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs of revenue and operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,318\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (247\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net effect of our foreign currency translations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was a $0.2 million decrease in revenue and a slight increase in operating expenses versus the year ended December 31, 2016 due to a stronger U.S. dollar on average\nduring the year 2016. The net effect of our foreign currency translations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was a $0.8 million decrease in revenue and a $1.3 million decrease in operating expenses versus the year ended December 31, 2016 due to a stronger U.S. dollar on average during the year 2015.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents our consolidated statements of operations in comparative

The increase is related to $1.2 million from the acquired companies offset by a decrease in organic license fee revenue primarily due to lower First User Activations (\u201cFUAs\u201d).\nLicense fees revenue decreased 9%, or $0.3 million to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in license fee revenue is primarily related to lower First User Activations (\u201cFUAs\u201d) offset by an increase of initial license sales.\nServices\nServices revenue increased 16%, or $3.5 million, to $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

The decrease in services revenue is due to a decline in fixed-price services from customization required of our software products offset by an increase of our customer support and managed services revenue due to Evolving Systems NC, which was acquired on September 30, 2015.\nCosts of Revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization\nCosts of revenue consist primarily of personnel costs, facilities costs, the costs of third-party software and all other direct costs associated with these personnel. Costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization were $8.7 million, $5.3 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCosts of revenue increased 64%, or $3.4 million, to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in costs of revenue is primarily attributable to the cost of revenue from the acquisitions of EVOL BLS and the Lumata Entities increasing the number of hours performed on customer projects. As a percentage of revenue, costs of revenue,\nexcluding depreciation and amortization, increased to 30% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 21% for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the aforementioned increase from the acquired entities.\nCosts of revenue decreased 18%, or $1.1 million, to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in costs was primarily the result of lower embedded software expense, reduced headcount, and travel, due to lower revenue during the period partially offset by increased expenses related to the operations of Evolving Systems NC. As a percentage of revenue, costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, decreased to 21% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 25% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in costs as a percentage of revenue is primarily related to the aforementioned reduction in costs of revenue which exceeded the decrease in revenue during the period.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including incentive compensation and commissions, other employee related costs, travel expenses, advertising and occupancy expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased 5%, or $0.2 million, to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in costs is primarily attributable to the sales and marketing expenses from the acquisitions offset partially by a reduction in employees. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to 18% from 20% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the acquired companies have a lower percentage of cost compared to the increase in revenue from the acquired companies and a reduction in employees.\nSales and marketing expenses decreased 15%, or $0.9 million, to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in costs is primarily related to partner fees, reduced employees and lower travel expenses offset by increased sales operations expenses related to Evolving Systems NC. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased to 20% from 23% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease as a percentage of revenue is due to the aforementioned reduction in expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of employee related costs, professional fees and occupancy costs for the following departments: facilities, finance, legal, human resources and executive management. General and administrative expenses increased 57%, or $2.2 million, to $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due primarily to higher professional fees and additional general and administrative costs relating to the acquisitions of $0.4 million, the write-off of uncollectable accounts of $0.9 million, and costs related to the acquired companies. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expenses increased to 21% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 16% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in expenses as a percentage of revenue is related to the aforementioned increase of expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased 4%, or $0.1 million, to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease for the period was primarily due to a decline of professional fees related to merger and acquisition activities and lower travel expense, offset by increased general and administrative expenses related to Evolving Systems NC and an allowance placed on uncollectible accounts receivables. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expenses remained at 16% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nProduct Development\nProduct development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for product development. Product development expenses decreased 32%, or $1.0 million, to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in product development expenses was due to hours worked on projects related to managed services which are charged to cost of revenue offset by the product and development expenses from the acquisitions of EVOL BLS and the Lumata Entities. As a percentage of total revenue, product development expenses decreased to 7% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 12% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the aforementioned decrease of expenses during the period.\nProduct development expenses decreased 22%, or $0.8 million, to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in costs was related to reduced headcount partially offset by expenses from Evolving Systems NC product development department. As a percentage of total revenue, product development\nexpenses decreased to 12% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 15% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in expenses as a percentage of revenue is related to the aforementioned decrease of expenses during the period.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation expense consists of depreciation of long-lived property and equipment. Depreciation expenses decreased 3% to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease of expense was due to lower capital purchases in the current period and older assets becoming fully depreciated. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation expense remained at 1% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nDepreciation expenses decreased 18%, or $0.1 million, to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease of expense was due to lower capital purchases in the current period and older assets becoming fully depreciated. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation expense remained at 1% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nAmortization\nAmortization expense consists of amortization of identifiable intangibles related to our acquisitions of Evolving Systems Labs, Evolving Systems NC, EVOL BLS, and the Lumata Entities. Amortization expense increased 10%, or $0.1 million to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in amortization expense was due to the amortization expense of the intangible assets relating to the acquisition of EVOL BLS on July 3, 2017 and the Lumata Entities on September 4, 2017. As a percentage of revenue, amortization expense remained 3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAmortization expense increased 194%, or $0.5 million to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in amortization expense was due to the amortization expense of the intangible assets relating to the acquisition of Evolving Systems NC on September 30, 2015. As a percentage of revenue, amortization expense increased to 3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 1% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of amortization expense as a percentage of total revenue is due to the aforementioned increase of expense.\nRestructuring\nRestructuring expense includes the costs associated with a reduction in workforce due to the consolidation of duplicative functions and alignment of staff with ongoing business activity as a result of the acquisition of EVOL BLS and the Lumata Entities in third quarter of 2017. Restructuring decreased 72%, or $0.7 million, to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of revenue, restructuring expense decreased to 1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 4% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease of restructuring expense as a percentage of total revenue is related to the lower activity in the current year.\nRestructuring increased 90%, or $0.5 million, to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Restructuring expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 related to the acquisition of Evolving Systems NC. As a percentage of revenue, restructuring expense increased to 4% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 2% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of restructuring expense as a percentage of total revenue is due to the aforementioned increase of expense and lower revenue.\nInterest Income\nInterest income includes interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and long-term investments. Interest income decreased 83%, or $5,000, to $1,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $6,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest income decreased 67%, or $12,000, to $6,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $18,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense includes interest expense on our term loan, revolving line of credit and amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 7% to $0.4 million as compared to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase in interest expense primarily due to the loan and security agreement with East West Bank which provided for a Term Loan of $4.7 million to purchase the Lumata entities offset by the amended security agreement with East West Bank which provided for a Term Loan of $6.0 million. The amendment agreement required us to use the term loan's proceeds and $4.0 million from our cash balances to pay off and terminate the Revolving Facilities totaling $10.0 million. The result of the $4.0\nmillion payment in February 2016 from our cash reserves and reducing the $10 million revolving facility to $6.0 million lowered the interest expense in the current period. Refer to Note 5, Long-Term Debt, of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the Term Loan.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 181%, or $0.2 million, to $0.3 million as compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase in interest expense was due to a larger principal balance from our term loan and revolving line of credit related to the acquisition of Evolving Systems NC.\nLoss on Foreign Exchange Transactions\nLoss on foreign exchange transactions consists of realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses result from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. The foreign currency transaction loss increased 106%, or $0.5 million, to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to a $0.6 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2016. The losses were generated primarily through the re-measurement of certain non-functional currency denominated financial assets and liabilities of our Evolving Systems U.K., EVOL BLS, the Lumata Entities and India subsidiaries.\nThe foreign currency transaction loss increased 9,100%, or $0.6 million, to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a $6,000 loss for the year ended December 31, 2015. The net loss was generated through the re-measurement of certain non-functional currency denominated financial assets and liabilities of our Evolving Systems U.K. and India subsidiaries of which the loss was primarily related to Evolving Systems U.K. contract receivables.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe recorded income tax expense of $1.4 million, $1.5 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The net expense during year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of current income tax expense of $1.7 million, a prior year tax assessment of $0.3 million and a net deferred tax benefit of ($0.6) million. The current tax expense consists primarily of income tax from our U.K., France, and India based operations. The deferred tax benefit was primarily a reduction of deferred tax liabilities related to the reduction in the valuation allowance on AMT credit carryforwards, the repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, and remeasurement of the deferred tax liabilities as December 31, 2017 based on the rate they are expected to reverse in the future. Refer to Note 6, Income Taxes, of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the foreign tax credit.\nThe net expense during year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of current income tax expense of $1.5 million and a net deferred tax benefit of ($24,000). The current tax expense consists primarily of income tax from our U.K. and India based operations. The deferred tax benefit was related primarily to the reduction of deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets incurred due to the acquisition of Evolving Systems NC.\nThe net expense during year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of current income tax expense of $2.0 million and a net deferred tax benefit of ($1.1) million. The current tax expense consists primarily of income tax from our U.S., U.K. and India based operations and unrecoverable foreign withholding tax in the U.K. U.S. income taxes payable of $0.8 million were offset due to realization of Net Operating Losses (\u201cNOL\u201d) comprised of windfall tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 36%, 30% and 22%, respectively. The effective tax rate increased in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to a prior year tax assessment of $0.3 million to an Indian subsidiary offset by $0.1 million related to the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate increased during 2016 was due to foreign tax credits utilized in 2015.\nWe use a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no liability for unrecognized tax benefits. We do not believe there will be any material changes to our unrecognized tax positions over the next twelve months.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nOur working capital position of $9.3 million at December 31, 2017 reflects an increase of $1.3 million from our working capital position of $8.0 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in working capital is related to increases in contract receivables, unbilled work-in-progress and prepaid and other current assets primarily as a result of the acquisitions of EVOL BLS and the Lumata Entities.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe have historically financed operations through cash flows from operations as well as debt and equity transactions. At December 31, 2017, our principal sources of liquidity were $7.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $10.2 million in contract receivables, net of allowances. During 2017, in connection with the Acquisition, EVOL Holdings entered into a Term Loan Facility Agreement, a Debenture and a Subordination Deed with East West Bank as lender in the amount of $4.7 million. We used the full amount of the Lumata Facility to fund the acquisition. The Lumata Facility requires the Company to make monthly principal payments of approximately $131,400 commencing July 31, 2018 and interest at the greater of (a) 3.5% or (b) the variable rate of interest that appears in the Wall Street Journal on a monthly measurement date, plus in either case 1.5%. The Lumata Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. The unpaid balance of the Lumata Facility is due on August 16, 2021.\nOn February 29, 2016, we retired the Revolving Facility and we entered into a term loan agreement with East West Bank (\u201cTerm Loan\u201d) for $6.0 million. The Term Loan bears interest at a floating rate equal to the U.S. Prime Rate plus 1.0% and is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets, including a pledge, subject to certain limitations with respect to stock of foreign subsidiaries, of the stock of the existing and future direct subsidiaries of the Company. Interest accrues and is payable monthly. We are required to repay the Term Loan in 36 equal monthly installments, commencing on January 1, 2017. We were required to use the $6 million Term Loan proceeds, plus $4.0 million from our cash reserves, to pay off the Revolving Facility. The Term Loan matures on January 1, 2020.\nBoth the Lumata Facility and the Term Loan (collectively, \u201cLoans\u201d) include negative covenants that place restrictions on the Company's ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; create liens or other encumbrances on assets; make loans, enter into letters of credit, guarantees, investments and acquisitions; sell or otherwise dispose of assets; cause or permit a change of control; merge or consolidate with another entity; make negative pledges; enter into affiliate transactions; limits the amount of cash distributions to our shareholders; and change the nature of our business materially. We must also maintain a minimum current ratio, a specified ratio of Total Liabilities to EBITDA and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in the Term Loan. As of the Balance Sheet date of December 31, 2017, we are in compliance with our covenants.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $3.5 million, $6.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to increase in contract receivables related to the acquisitions and additional expenses related to the acquisitions as well as a decrease in accounts payable and current liabilities.\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to higher collections of contract receivables and decreased unbilled work-in-progress as-well-as increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and unearned revenue.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $6.0 million, $0.1 million and $9.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was for the acquisition of EVOL BLS and the Lumata Entities as well as the purchase of property and equipment. Refer to Note 2, Acquisition, of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the acquisitions. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we purchased $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $0.2 million in property and equipment to support operations, respectively. Historically, capital expenditures have been financed by cash from operating activities.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was related to the purchase of property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was related to the acquisition of Evolving Systems NC and purchase of property and equipment.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $2.7 million, ($6.6) million and $5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cash provided was primarily related to the proceeds from the Lumata Facility entered into August 2017 to acquire the Lumata Entities offset by the principal payments on our term loan and the payment for second year debt issuance costs.\nThe net cash used in financing activities as of December 31, 2016 is due to proceeds from the term loan of $6.0 million, which was used along with $4.0 million of cash-on-hand to pay off the revolving line of credit of $10.0 million and $2.6 million paid for dividends. The net cash provided by financing activities as of December 31, 2015 is due to proceeds from the revolving line of credit of $10.0 million for the initial payment of the acquisition of Evolving Systems NC, $0.8 million in windfall tax benefits from stock-based compensation and $0.3 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options offset by payments of $5.1 million for dividends.\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, together with anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, debt extinguishment and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months as of the date this Form 10-K was filed. In making this assessment, we considered the following:\n\u00b7 Our cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2017 of $7.6 million;\n\u00b7 Our working capital balance of $9.3 million;\n\u00b7 Our ability to historically generate positive operating cash flows; and\n\u00b7 Our planned capital expenditures of less than $1.0 million during 2018.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency rate risks which impact the carrying amount of our foreign subsidiaries and our consolidated equity, as well as our consolidated cash position due to translation adjustments. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the effect of exchange rate changes resulted in a ($0.2) million decrease, ($1.1) million decrease and a ($0.3) million decrease to consolidated cash, respectively. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency exposure, but we closely monitor the rate changes and may hedge our exposures in the future.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect, or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect, on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017, which are comprised of operating leases (in thousands).\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when an agreement is signed, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue from two primary sources: license fees and services. The majority of our license fees and services revenue is generated from fixed-price contracts, which provide for licenses to our software products and services to customize such software to meet our customers' use. When the customization services are determined to be essential to the functionality of the delivered software, we recognize revenue using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. In these types of arrangements, we do not typically have vendor specific objective evidence (\u201cVSOE\u201d) of fair value on the license fee/services portion (services are related to customizing the software) of the arrangement due to the large amount of customization required by our customers; however, we do have VSOE for the warranty/maintenance services based on the renewal rate of the first year of maintenance in the arrangement. The license/services portion is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting and the warranty/maintenance services are separated based on the renewal rate in the contract and recognized ratably over the warranty or maintenance period. We estimate the percentage-of-completion for each contract based on the ratio of direct labor hours incurred to total estimated direct labor hours and recognize revenue based on the percent complete multiplied by the contract amount allocated to the license fee/services. Since estimated direct labor hours, and changes thereto, can have a significant impact on revenue recognition, these estimates are critical and we review them regularly. If the arrangement includes a customer acceptance provision, the hours to complete the\nacceptance testing are included in the total estimated direct labor hours; therefore, the related revenue is recognized as the acceptance testing is performed. Revenue is not recognized in full until the customer has provided proof of acceptance on the arrangement. Generally, our contracts are accounted for individually. However, when certain criteria are met, it may be necessary to account for two or more contracts as one to reflect the substance of the group of contracts. We record amounts billed in advance of services being performed as unearned revenue. Unbilled work-in-progress represents revenue earned but not yet billable under the terms of the fixed-price contracts. All such amounts are expected to be billed and collected within 12 months.\nWe may encounter budget and schedule overruns on fixed-price contracts caused by increased labor or overhead costs. We make adjustments to cost estimates in the period in which the facts requiring such revisions become known. We record estimated losses, if any, in the period in which current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs indicate a loss. If revisions to cost estimates are obtained after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of the interim or annual financial statements, we make adjustments to the interim or annual financial statements accordingly.\nIn arrangements where the services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered software, we recognize license revenue when a license agreement has been signed, delivery and acceptance have occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Where applicable, we unbundle and record as revenue fees from multiple element arrangements as the elements are delivered to the extent that VSOE of fair value of the undelivered elements exist. If VSOE for the undelivered elements does not exist, we defer fees from such arrangements until the earlier of the date that VSOE does exist on the undelivered elements or all of the elements have been delivered.\nWe recognize revenue from fixed-price service contracts using the proportional performance method of accounting, which is similar to the percentage-of-completion method described above. We recognize revenue from professional services provided pursuant to time-and-materials based contracts and training services as the services are performed, as that is when our obligation to our customers under such arrangements is fulfilled.\nWe recognize revenue from our managed services contracts primarily ratably over the service contract period. On occasion, our managed services contracts will contain a specified number of hours to work over the term of the contract. Revenue for this type of managed service contract is recognized using the proportional performance method of accounting.\nWe recognize revenue from our Mobile Data Enablement (\u201cMDE\u201d) contracts based on the number of transactions per month multiplied by a factor based on a unique table for transaction volumes relating to each account at a rate for the particular Tier level attained.\nWe recognize customer support, including maintenance revenue, ratably over the service contract period. When maintenance is bundled with the original license fee arrangement, its fair value, based upon VSOE, is deferred and recognized during the periods when services are provided.\nContract Receivables, Unbilled Work-in-Progress and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - Contract receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Credit is extended based on the evaluation of a customer's financial condition and collateral is not required. Unbilled work in progress is revenue which has been earned but not invoiced. An allowance is placed against accounts receivable or unbilled work in progress for our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses. We determine the allowance based on historical write-off experience and information received during collection efforts. We review our allowances monthly and past due balances over 90 days are reviewed individually for collectability. Account balances are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe make judgments related to our ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable and unbilled work-in-progress. We provide allowances for receivables when their collection becomes doubtful by recording an expense. We determine the allowance based on our assessment of the realization of receivables using historical information and current economic trends, including assessing the probability of collection from customers. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments owed to us, an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts would be required. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance regularly and make adjustments accordingly. Adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts could materially affect our results of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. We consider future taxable income projections, historical results and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets. However, adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that the amount to be realized is less or greater than the amount that we recorded. Such adjustments, if any, could have a material impact on our results of our operations.\nWe use a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company uses the incremental approach to recognizing excess tax benefits associated with equity compensation.\nOn December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act (the Tax Act) was enacted into law and the new legislation contains key tax provisions that affected us. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the transition tax, remeasuring our US deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not extend beyond one year of the enactment date,since the Tax Act was passed late in the year.\nBusiness Combinations - On July 6, 2017 and September 7, 2017 we announced our acquisitions of Business Logic Systems which became EVOL BLS and the four business operating units of Lumata Holdings Ltd.. This business combinations are reflected in these consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information regarding the acquisitions.\nWe account for business combinations in accordance with the acquisition method. The acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their fair values on the date of a business acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Certain adjustments to the assessed fair values of the assets and liabilities made subsequent to the acquisition date, but within the measurement period, which is up to one year, are recorded as adjustments to goodwill. Any adjustments subsequent to the measurement period are recorded in income. Our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business from the completion date of an acquisition.\nThe judgments that we make in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact net income in periods following a business combination. We generally use either the income, cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions of such fair values and asset lives. The income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the asset, discounted to present value. The cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction cost. The market approach estimates value based on what other participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets. Although each valuation approach is considered in valuing the assets acquired, the approach ultimately selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of information.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but tested for impairment annually or whenever indicators of impairment exist. These indicators may include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.\nWe performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of July 31, 2017, at which time we had $21.5 million. The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using both market and income based approaches. Specifically, we incorporated observed market multiple data from selected guideline public companies and values arrived at through the application of discounted cash flow analyses which in turn were based upon our financial projections as of the valuation date. We believe that a market participant would weigh both possibilities without a bias to one or the other. Consequently, we gave equal consideration to both. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. If the carrying value of a reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, we would then compare the fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying amount, and any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value would be charged to operations as an impairment loss. If the projected future performance of our segment as estimated in the income valuation approach is adjusted downward or is lower than expected in the future, we could be required to record a goodwill\nimpairment charge. As a result of the first step of the 2017 goodwill impairment analysis, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Therefore the second step was not necessary. Due to our transition of packaging our products and services into a single managed service offering, we have determined we have one reporting unit. We do not believe the aggregation of our reporting units impacts the value of our goodwill nor are there any events through the date this Form 10 K was filed which impact our assumptions on the determination of the fair value of our goodwill.\nIntangible Assets\nAmortizable intangible assets consist primarily of purchased software and licenses, customer relationships, trademarks and tradenames, non-competition and purchased software acquired in conjunction with our purchase of Evolving Systems Labs, Evolving Systems NC,, EVOL BLS and the Lumata Entities. These assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated lives.\nWe assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.\nIf we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and/or long-lived assets may not be recoverable, we compare the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition to the asset's carrying amount. If an amortizable intangible or long-lived asset is not deemed to be recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss representing the excess of the asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value.\nCapitalization of Internal Software Development Costs\nWe expend amounts on product development, particularly for new products and/or for enhancements of existing products. For internal development of software products that are to be licensed by us, we expense the cost of developing software prior to establishing technological feasibility and those costs are capitalized once technological feasibility has been established. Capitalization ceases upon general release of the software. The determination of whether internal software development costs are subject to capitalization is, by its nature, highly subjective and involves significant judgments. This decision could significantly affect earnings during the development period. Further, once capitalized, the software costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the product. The determination of the expected useful life of a product is highly judgmental. Finally, capitalized software costs must be assessed for impairment if facts and circumstances warrant such a review.\nWe did not capitalize any internal software development costs during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, or 2015. In addition, we did not have any capitalized internal software development costs included in our December 31, 2017 and 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe that during these periods no material internal software development costs were required to be capitalized. Our conclusion is primarily based on the fact that the feature-rich, pre-integrated, and highly-scalable nature of our products requires that our development efforts include complex design, coding and testing methodologies, which include next generation software languages and development tools. Development projects of this nature carry a high degree of development risk.\nSubstantially all of our internal software development efforts are of this nature, and therefore, we believe the period between achieving technological feasibility and the general release of the software to operations is so short that any costs incurred during this period are not material.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation by applying a fair-value-based measurement method to account for share-based payment transactions with employees and directors and record compensation cost for all stock awards granted after January 1, 2006 and awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after that date. We record compensation costs associated with the vesting of unvested options on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense because we settle these obligations by issuing shares of our common stock instead of settling such obligations with cash payments. We use the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant. This model requires the use of estimates for expected term of the options and expected volatility of the price of our common stock.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Stock Compensation (Topic 718), which includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We adopted this ASU during the first quarter 2017. The key effects of the adoption on our financial statements include that the Company will now recognize windfall tax benefits as deferred tax assets instead of tracking the windfall pool and recording such benefits in equity. Additionally, we have elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur rather than estimating them at the time of grant.\nThe fair market value of restricted shares for share-based compensation expensing is equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Of the restrictions on the stock awards granted during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, 20% will be released in January 2018, and 10% annually beginning on the one year anniversary of their offering thereafter for four years. The remaining 40% will be released evenly over four years beginning in 2018 contingent upon the attainment of annual performance goals established by our Board of Directors. Of the restrictions on the stock awards granted during the three months ended September 30, 2017, one-fourth will be released on the one-year anniversary of the date of the grant and the balance will be released quarterly over a three year period. Of the restrictions on the stock awards granted during the three months ended December 31, 2017, one-fourth will be released on the one-year anniversary of the date of the grant and the balance will be released quarterly over a three year period.\nStock-based payments made to non-employees, including grants of stock options, are recognized in the statements of operations based on their estimated fair values. The fair value of these options will be re-measured on each reporting date until the options vest. The re-measured fair value will be recognized as compensation expense over the remaining vesting term of the options.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d Topic 606. This Update affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets, unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards. The guidance in this Update supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to illustrate the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance also includes a cohesive set of disclosure requirements that will provide users of financial statements with comprehensive information about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a reporting organization's contracts with customers. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d Topic 606: \u201cIdentifying Performance Obligations and Licensing\u201d. This Update clarifies guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance contained in the new revenue recognition standard. The Update includes targeted improvements based on input the Board received from the Transition Resource Group for Revenue Recognition and other stakeholders. The update seeks to proactively address areas in which diversity in practice potentially could arise, as well as to reduce the cost and complexity of applying certain aspects of the guidance both at implementation and on an ongoing basis. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d Topic 606: \u201cNarrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients\u201d. The amendments in this Update address narrow-scope improvements to the guidance on collectability, noncash consideration, and completed contracts at transition. Additionally, the amendments in this Update provide a practical expedient for contract modifications at transition and an accounting policy election related to the presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers. This ASU is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update 2015-320, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d (Topic 606): \u201cNarrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,\u201d which has been deleted. In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-20, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d Topic 606: \u201cTechnical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d. The amendments in this Update address narrow-scope improvements to the guidance on loan guarantee fees, contract cost-impairment testing, contract costs-interaction of impairment testing with guidance in other topics, provision for losses on construction-type and production-type contracts, scope of topic 606 to exclude all contracts that are within the scope of Topic 944, disclosure of remaining performance obligations, disclosure of prior-period performance obligations, contract modifications, contract asset versus receivable, refund liability, advertising costs, fixed-odds wagering contracts in the casino industry and cost capitalization for advisors to private funds and public funds. The Board decided to issue a separate Update for technical corrections and improvements to Topic 606 and other Topics amended by Update 2014-09 to increase stakeholders' awareness of the proposals and to expedite improvements to Update 2014-09. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017 for public companies and 2018 for non-public entities. We adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method.\nWe developed an implementation plan to adopt this new guidance, which included an assessment of the impact of the new guidance on our financial position and results of operations. We have substantially completed our assessment and have determined that this standard will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations, except enhanced disclosure regarding revenue recognition, including disclosures of revenue streams, performance obligations, variable consideration and the related judgments and estimates necessary to apply the new standard. On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and for all open contracts and related amendments as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 will be presented under ASC 606, while\nthe comparative information will not be restated and will continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets by recognizing a lessee's rights and obligations, while expenses will continue to be recognized in a similar manner to today's legacy lease accounting guidance. This ASU could also significantly affect the financial ratios used for external reporting and other purposes, such as debt covenant compliance. This ASU will be effective for us on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business (ASU 2017-01), which revises the definition of a business and provides new guidance in evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017 for public companies and 2018 for non-public entities. We not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), which includes provisions intended to simplify the test for goodwill impairment. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) - Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This standard allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and requires certain disclosures about stranded tax effects. This standard will be effective for the Company beginning after December 15, 2018 and should be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new accounting standard.\nIn March 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\u201cASU 2018-05\u201d). This standard amends Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740) to provide guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) pursuant to Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 18, which allows companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740 within a one-year measurement period from the Tax Act enactment date. This standard is effective upon issuance. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new accounting standard.", "summary": "The report provides an analysis of Evolving Systems' financial condition and operations, including its recent developments.

The final payment has not been made as of the date this Form 10-K was filed due to pending resolution of outstanding claims.\nWe have operations in foreign countries where the local currency is used to prepare the consolidated financial statements which are translated into our reporting currency, U.S. dollars. Changes in the exchange rates between these currencies and our reporting currency are partially responsible for some of the changes from period to period in our financial statement amounts. The majority of the changes in 2017 and 2016 are a result of the U.S. dollar strengthening on average versus the British Pound Sterling. The chart below summarizes what the effects on our revenue and expenses would be on a constant currency basis. The constant currency basis assumes that the exchange rate was constant for the periods presented (in thousands).\n\nThe net effect of our foreign currency translations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was a $0.2 million decrease in revenue and a slight increase in operating expenses versus the year ended December 31, 2016 due to a stronger U.S. dollar on average\nduring the year 2016. The net effect of our foreign currency translations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was a $0.8 million decrease in revenue and a $1.3 million decrease in operating expenses versus the year ended December 31, 2016 due to a stronger U.S. dollar on average during the year 2015.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents our consolidated statements of operations in comparative format.\n\nThe following table presents our consolidated statements of operations reflected as a percentage of total revenue.\n\nRevenue\nRevenue is comprised of license fees and services.

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 7% to $0.4 million as compared to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase in interest expense primarily due to the loan and security agreement with East West Bank which provided for a Term Loan of $4.7 million to purchase the Lumata entities offset by the amended security agreement with East West Bank which provided for a Term Loan of $6.0 million. The amendment agreement required us to use the term loan's proceeds and $4.0 million from our cash balances to pay off and terminate the Revolving Facilities totaling $10.0 million. The result of the $4.0\nmillion payment in February 2016 from our cash reserves and reducing the $10 million revolving facility to $6.0 million lowered the interest expense in the current period. Refer to Note 5, Long-Term Debt, of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the Term Loan.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 181%, or $0.2 million, to $0.3 million as compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The net loss was generated through the re-measurement of certain non-functional currency denominated financial assets and liabilities of our Evolving Systems U.K. and India subsidiaries of which the loss was primarily related to Evolving Systems U.K. contract receivables.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe recorded income tax expense of $1.4 million, $1.5 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The net expense during year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of current income tax expense of $1.7 million, a prior year tax assessment of $0.3 million and a net deferred tax benefit of ($0.6) million. The current tax expense consists primarily of income tax from our U.K., France, and India based operations. The deferred tax benefit was primarily a reduction of deferred tax liabilities related to the reduction in the valuation allowance on AMT credit carryforwards, the repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, and remeasurement of the deferred tax liabilities as December 31, 2017 based on the rate they are expected to reverse in the future. Refer to Note 6, Income Taxes, of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the foreign tax credit.\nThe net expense during year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of current income tax expense of $1.5 million and a net deferred tax benefit of ($24,000). The current tax expense consists primarily of income tax from our U.K. and India based operations. The deferred tax benefit was related primarily to the reduction of deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets incurred due to the acquisition of Evolving Systems NC.\nThe net expense during year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of current income tax expense of $2.0 million and a net deferred tax benefit of ($1.1) million. The current tax expense consists primarily of income tax from our U.S., U.K. and India based operations and unrecoverable foreign withholding tax in the U.K. U.S. income taxes payable of $0.8 million were offset due to realization of Net Operating Losses (\u201cNOL\u201d) comprised of windfall tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 36%, 30% and 22%, respectively. The effective tax rate increased in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to a prior year tax assessment of $0.3 million to an Indian subsidiary offset by $0.1 million related to the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate increased during 2016 was due to foreign tax credits utilized in 2015.\nWe use a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no liability for unrecognized tax benefits. We do not believe there will be any material changes to our unrecognized tax positions over the next twelve months.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nOur working capital position of $9.3 million at December 31, 2017 reflects an increase of $1.3 million from our working capital position of $8.0 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in working capital is related to increases in contract receivables, unbilled work-in-progress and prepaid and other current assets primarily as a result of the acquisitions of EVOL BLS and the Lumata Entities.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe have historically financed operations through cash flows from operations as well as debt and equity transactions. At December 31, 2017, our principal sources of liquidity were $7.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $10.2 million in contract receivables, net of allowances. During 2017, in connection with the Acquisition, EVOL Holdings entered into a Term Loan Facility Agreement, a Debenture and a Subordination Deed with East West Bank as lender in the amount of $4.7 million. We used the full amount of the Lumata Facility to fund the acquisition. The Lumata Facility requires the Company to make monthly principal payments of approximately $131,400 commencing July 31, 2018 and interest at the greater of (a) 3.5% or (b) the variable rate of interest that appears in the Wall Street Journal on a monthly measurement date, plus in either case 1.5%.

License fees represent the fees we receive from the licensing of our software products. Services revenue are services directly related to the delivery of the licensed product as well as integration services, managed services, SaaS services, time and materials work and customer support services. Customer support services includes annual support fees, recurring maintenance fees, minor product upgrades and warranty fees. Warranty fees are typically bundled with a license sale and the related revenue, based on Vendor Specific Objective Evidence (\u201cVSOE\u201d)and is deferred and recognized ratably over the warranty period.\nLicense Fees\nLicense fees revenue increased 20%, or $0.5 million to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is related to $1.2 million from the acquired companies offset by a decrease in organic license fee revenue primarily due to lower First User Activations (\u201cFUAs\u201d).\nLicense fees revenue decreased 9%, or $0.3 million to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in license fee revenue is primarily related to lower First User Activations (\u201cFUAs\u201d) offset by an increase of initial license sales.\nServices\nServices revenue increased 16%, or $3.5 million, to $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is related to $4.8 million in service revenue from the acquired companies offset by a decline in our customer support and managed services revenues.\nServices revenue decreased 2%, or $0.5 million, to $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in services revenue is due to a decline in fixed-price services from customization required of our software products offset by an increase of our customer support and managed services revenue due to Evolving Systems NC, which was acquired on September 30, 2015.\nCosts of Revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization\nCosts of revenue consist primarily of personnel costs, facilities costs, the costs of third-party software and all other direct costs associated with these personnel. Costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization were $8.7 million, $5.3 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCosts of revenue increased 64%, or $3.4 million, to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in costs of revenue is primarily attributable to the cost of revenue from the acquisitions of EVOL BLS and the Lumata Entities increasing the number of hours performed on customer projects. As a percentage of revenue, costs of revenue,\nexcluding depreciation and amortization, increased to 30% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 21% for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the aforementioned increase from the acquired entities.\nCosts of revenue decreased 18%, or $1.1 million, to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in costs was primarily the result of lower embedded software expense, reduced headcount, and travel, due to lower revenue during the period partially offset by increased expenses related to the operations of Evolving Systems NC. As a percentage of revenue, costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, decreased to 21% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 25% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in costs as a percentage of revenue is primarily related to the aforementioned reduction in costs of revenue which exceeded the decrease in revenue during the period.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including incentive compensation and commissions, other employee related costs, travel expenses, advertising and occupancy expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased 5%, or $0.2 million, to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in costs is primarily attributable to the sales and marketing expenses from the acquisitions offset partially by a reduction in employees. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to 18% from 20% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the acquired companies have a lower percentage of cost compared to the increase in revenue from the acquired companies and a reduction in employees.\nSales and marketing expenses decreased 15%, or $0.9 million, to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in costs is primarily related to partner fees, reduced employees and lower travel expenses offset by increased sales operations expenses related to Evolving Systems NC. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased to 20% from 23% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease as a percentage of revenue is due to the aforementioned reduction in expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of employee related costs, professional fees and occupancy costs for the following departments: facilities, finance, legal, human resources and executive management. General and administrative expenses increased 57%, or $2.2 million, to $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due primarily to higher professional fees and additional general and administrative costs relating to the acquisitions of $0.4 million, the write-off of uncollectable accounts of $0.9 million, and costs related to the acquired companies. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expenses increased to 21% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 16% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in expenses as a percentage of revenue is related to the aforementioned increase of expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased 4%, or $0.1 million, to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease for the period was primarily due to a decline of professional fees related to merger and acquisition activities and lower travel expense, offset by increased general and administrative expenses related to Evolving Systems NC and an allowance placed on uncollectible accounts receivables. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expenses remained at 16% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nProduct Development\nProduct development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for product development. Product development expenses decreased 32%, or $1.0 million, to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in product development expenses was due to hours worked on projects related to managed services which are charged to cost of revenue offset by the product and development expenses from the acquisitions of EVOL BLS and the Lumata Entities. As a percentage of total revenue, product development expenses decreased to 7% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 12% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the aforementioned decrease of expenses during the period.\nProduct development expenses decreased 22%, or $0.8 million, to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in costs was related to reduced headcount partially offset by expenses from Evolving Systems NC product development department. As a percentage of total revenue, product development\nexpenses decreased to 12% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 15% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in expenses as a percentage of revenue is related to the aforementioned decrease of expenses during the period.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation expense consists of depreciation of long-lived property and equipment. Depreciation expenses decreased 3% to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease of expense was due to lower capital purchases in the current period and older assets becoming fully depreciated. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation expense remained at 1% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nDepreciation expenses decreased 18%, or $0.1 million, to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease of expense was due to lower capital purchases in the current period and older assets becoming fully depreciated. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation expense remained at 1% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nAmortization\nAmortization expense consists of amortization of identifiable intangibles related to our acquisitions of Evolving Systems Labs, Evolving Systems NC, EVOL BLS, and the Lumata Entities. Amortization expense increased 10%, or $0.1 million to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in amortization expense was due to the amortization expense of the intangible assets relating to the acquisition of EVOL BLS on July 3, 2017 and the Lumata Entities on September 4, 2017. As a percentage of revenue, amortization expense remained 3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAmortization expense increased 194%, or $0.5 million to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in amortization expense was due to the amortization expense of the intangible assets relating to the acquisition of Evolving Systems NC on September 30, 2015. As a percentage of revenue, amortization expense increased to 3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 1% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of amortization expense as a percentage of total revenue is due to the aforementioned increase of expense.\nRestructuring\nRestructuring expense includes the costs associated with a reduction in workforce due to the consolidation of duplicative functions and alignment of staff with ongoing business activity as a result of the acquisition of EVOL BLS and the Lumata Entities in third quarter of 2017. Restructuring decreased 72%, or $0.7 million, to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of revenue, restructuring expense decreased to 1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 4% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease of restructuring expense as a percentage of total revenue is related to the lower activity in the current year.\nRestructuring increased 90%, or $0.5 million, to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Restructuring expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 related to the acquisition of Evolving Systems NC. As a percentage of revenue, restructuring expense increased to 4% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 2% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of restructuring expense as a percentage of total revenue is due to the aforementioned increase of expense and lower revenue.\nInterest Income\nInterest income includes interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and long-term investments. Interest income decreased 83%, or $5,000, to $1,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $6,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest income decreased 67%, or $12,000, to $6,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $18,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense includes interest expense on our term loan, revolving line of credit and amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 7% to $0.4 million as compared to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase in interest expense primarily due to the loan and security agreement with East West Bank which provided for a Term Loan of $4.7 million to purchase the Lumata entities offset by the amended security agreement with East West Bank which provided for a Term Loan of $6.0 million. The amendment agreement required us to use the term loan's proceeds and $4.0 million from our cash balances to pay off and terminate the Revolving Facilities totaling $10.0 million. The result of the $4.0\nmillion payment in February 2016 from our cash reserves and reducing the $10 million revolving facility to $6.0 million lowered the interest expense in the current period. Refer to Note 5, Long-Term Debt, of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the Term Loan.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 181%, or $0.2 million, to $0.3 million as compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase in interest expense was due to a larger principal balance from our term loan and revolving line of credit related to the acquisition of Evolving Systems NC.\nLoss on Foreign Exchange Transactions\nLoss on foreign exchange transactions consists of realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses result from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. The foreign currency transaction loss increased 106%, or $0.5 million, to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to a $0.6 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2016. The losses were generated primarily through the re-measurement of certain non-functional currency denominated financial assets and liabilities of our Evolving Systems U.K., EVOL BLS, the Lumata Entities and India subsidiaries.\nThe foreign currency transaction loss increased 9,100%, or $0.6 million, to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a $6,000 loss for the year ended December 31, 2015. The net loss was generated through the re-measurement of certain non-functional currency denominated financial assets and liabilities of our Evolving Systems U.K. and India subsidiaries of which the loss was primarily related to Evolving Systems U.K. contract receivables.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe recorded income tax expense of $1.4 million, $1.5 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The net expense during year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of current income tax expense of $1.7 million, a prior year tax assessment of $0.3 million and a net deferred tax benefit of ($0.6) million. The current tax expense consists primarily of income tax from our U.K., France, and India based operations. The deferred tax benefit was primarily a reduction of deferred tax liabilities related to the reduction in the valuation allowance on AMT credit carryforwards, the repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, and remeasurement of the deferred tax liabilities as December 31, 2017 based on the rate they are expected to reverse in the future. Refer to Note 6, Income Taxes, of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the foreign tax credit.\nThe net expense during year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of current income tax expense of $1.5 million and a net deferred tax benefit of ($24,000). The current tax expense consists primarily of income tax from our U.K. and India based operations. The deferred tax benefit was related primarily to the reduction of deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets incurred due to the acquisition of Evolving Systems NC.\nThe net expense during year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of current income tax expense of $2.0 million and a net deferred tax benefit of ($1.1) million. The current tax expense consists primarily of income tax from our U.S., U.K. and India based operations and unrecoverable foreign withholding tax in the U.K. U.S. income taxes payable of $0.8 million were offset due to realization of Net Operating Losses (\u201cNOL\u201d) comprised of windfall tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 36%, 30% and 22%, respectively. The effective tax rate increased in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to a prior year tax assessment of $0.3 million to an Indian subsidiary offset by $0.1 million related to the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate increased during 2016 was due to foreign tax credits utilized in 2015.\nWe use a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
