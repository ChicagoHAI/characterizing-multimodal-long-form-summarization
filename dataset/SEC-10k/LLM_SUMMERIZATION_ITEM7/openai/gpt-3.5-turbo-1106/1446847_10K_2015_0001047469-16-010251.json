Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Information\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial biotechnology company leveraging our proven development and commercial capabilities as we seek to bring multiple medicines to patients. We are advancing two therapeutic platforms, which include product opportunities in areas of large unmet need, including irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, or IBS-C, and chronic idiopathic constipation, or CIC, vascular and fibrotic diseases, and refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD.\nOur first and to-date only commercial product, linaclotide, is available to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in the United States, or the U.S., under the trademarked name LINZESS\u00ae, and is available to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C in certain European\ncountries under the trademarked name CONSTELLA\u00ae. We and our U.S. partner Allergan plc (together with its affiliates), or Allergan (formerly Actavis plc), began commercializing LINZESS in the U.S. in December 2012. Under our collaboration with Allergan for North America, total net sales of LINZESS in the U.S., as recorded by Allergan, are reduced by commercial costs incurred by each party, and the resulting amount is shared equally between us and Allergan.\nOur former European partner, Almirall, S.A., or Almirall, began commercializing CONSTELLA in Europe for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe IBS-C in adults in the second quarter of 2013. In October 2015, Almirall transferred its exclusive license to develop and commercialize linaclotide in Europe to Allergan, and we and Allergan entered into an amendment to the European license agreement to modify the remaining sales-based milestones and royalties payable to us and to provide for Allergan's assumption of responsibility for, and cost of, the manufacturing of linaclotide active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for Europe from us. This amendment, together with the transfer of the European license for linaclotide from Almirall to Allergan, is more fully described in Note 4, Collaboration, License and Co-promotion Agreements, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Currently, CONSTELLA is commercially available in certain European countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain.\nWithin our gastrointestinal, or GI, platform, we and Allergan are exploring development opportunities to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by seeking to expand its utility within IBS-C and CIC, as well as studying linaclotide in additional indications and populations to assess its potential to treat various GI conditions. In October 2015, as part of this strategy, we reported positive top-line data from a Phase III clinical trial in the U.S. with Allergan evaluating a 72 mcg dose of linaclotide in adult patients with CIC. We believe these data support the submission of a supplemental new drug application, or sNDA, to the FDA for approval to market the 72 mcg dose of linaclotide in the U.S. If approved, the 72 mcg dose would provide a broader range of treatment options to physicians and adult CIC patients in the U.S. Linaclotide is also being developed and commercialized in other parts of the world by certain of our partners.\nWe and Allergan are also developing linaclotide colonic release, a targeted oral delivery formulation of linaclotide designed to potentially improve abdominal pain relief in adult IBS-C patients. In addition to IBS-C, we are exploring linaclotide colonic release for use in additional GI disorders where lower abdominal pain is a predominant symptom, including IBS-mixed, or IBS-M, ulcerative colitis and diverticulitis, among others.\nWe are also advancing other GI development programs for multiple indications. For example, we are investigating IW-3718, a gastric retentive formulation of a bile acid sequestrant that is being evaluated for the potential treatment of refractory GERD. We are also investigating IW-9179, a guanylate cyclase type-C, or GC-C, agonist designed to target upper GI conditions, for the treatment of gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia.\nWithin our vascular/fibrotic platform, we are leveraging our pharmacological expertise in guanylate cyclase, or GC, pathways gained through the discovery and development of linaclotide to advance development programs targeting soluble guanylate cyclase, or sGC. sGC is a validated mechanism with the potential for broad therapeutic utility and multiple opportunities for product development in vascular and fibrotic diseases, as well as other therapeutic areas. To date, we have identified two sGC development candidates, IW-1973 and IW-1701, which have distinct pharmacologic profiles that we believe may be differentiating and enable opportunities in multiple indications.\nAs part of our strategy, we have also established development and commercial capabilities that we plan to leverage as we seek to bring multiple medicines to patients. We intend to play an active role in the development and commercialization of our internally developed products in the U.S., and to establish a strong global brand by out-licensing commercialization rights in other territories to high-performing partners. In addition to the U.S. and Europe, we have entered into partnerships to develop and commercialize linaclotide in other parts of the world.\nIn December 2013 and February 2014, linaclotide was approved in Canada and Mexico, respectively, as a treatment for adult women and men suffering from IBS-C or CIC. Allergan has exclusive rights to commercialize linaclotide in Canada as CONSTELLA and, through a sublicense from Allergan, Almirall had exclusive rights to commercialize linaclotide in Mexico as LINZESS. In May 2014, Allergan began commercializing CONSTELLA in Canada and in June 2014, Almirall began commercializing LINZESS in Mexico. In October 2015, Almirall and Allergan terminated the sublicense arrangement with respect to Mexico, returning the exclusive rights to commercialize CONSTELLA in Mexico to Allergan. CONSTELLA continues to be available to adult IBS-C patients in Mexico.\nAstellas Pharma Inc., or Astellas, our partner in Japan, is developing linaclotide for the treatment of patients with IBS-C and chronic constipation in its territory. In November 2015, we and Astellas reported positive top-line data from Astellas' Phase III clinical trial of linaclotide in adult patients with IBS-C for Japan. We believe these data support the submission of a new drug application, or NDA, to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for approval to market linaclotide in Japan. In October 2012, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca AB, or AstraZeneca, to co-develop and co-commercialize linaclotide in China, Hong Kong and Macau, with AstraZeneca having primary responsibility for the local operational execution. In December 2015, we and AstraZeneca filed for approval with the China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA, to market linaclotide in China. We continue to assess alternatives to bring linaclotide to IBS-C and CIC sufferers in the parts of the world outside of our partnered territories.\nIn March 2015, we and Exact Sciences Corp, or Exact Sciences, entered into an agreement to co-promote Cologuard\u00ae, the first and only FDA-approved noninvasive stool DNA screening test for colorectal cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, our sales team is promoting and educating health care practitioners regarding Cologuard. We are also collaborating on medical education initiatives to support more in-depth understanding of Cologuard and the importance of colorectal cancer screening. Exact Sciences maintains responsibility for all other aspects of the commercialization of Cologuard outside of the co-promotion. We are compensated via reimbursements for sales detailing, promotional support services and medical education initiatives. We also earn royalties on the net sales of Cologuard generated from the healthcare practitioners on whom we call less the sales promotion reimbursement to us.\nIn August 2015, we and Allergan entered into an agreement for the co-promotion of VIBERZI\u2122 (eluxadoline) in the U.S., Allergan's treatment for adults suffering from IBS with diarrhea, or IBS-D. Under the terms of the agreement, our clinical sales specialists are detailing VIBERZI to the approximately 25,000 health care practitioners to whom they detail LINZESS. Allergan is responsible for all costs and activities relating to the commercialization of VIBERZI outside the co-promotion. Our promotional efforts are compensated based on the volume of calls delivered by our sales force, with the terms of the agreement reducing or eliminating certain of the unfavorable adjustments to the share of net profits stipulated by the linaclotide collaboration agreement with Allergan for North America, provided that we deliver a minimum number of VIBERZI calls on physicians. We are also compensated via reimbursement for medical education initiatives.\nIn November 2015, Allergan and Pfizer Inc. entered into a definitive agreement providing for the combination of the two companies. Our collaboration for the development and commercialization of linaclotide, as well as our agreement to co-promote VIBERZI, remains in effect.\nIn January 2013, we closed a private placement of $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 11% PhaRMA Notes due 2024, or the PhaRMA Notes. As a result of the debt offering, we received aggregate net proceeds, after offering expenses, of approximately $167.3 million. During the second quarter of 2013, we sold 11,204,948 shares of our Class A common stock through a firm commitment, underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $13.00 per share. As a result of the offering, we received aggregate net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses, of approximately $137.8 million. In February 2014, we sold 15,784,325 shares of our Class A common stock through a firm commitment, underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $12.75 per share. As a result of this offering, we received aggregate net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses, of approximately $190.4 million. In June 2015, we issued approximately $335.7 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022, or the 2022 Notes. We received net proceeds of approximately $324.0 million from the sale of the 2022 Notes, after deducting fees and expenses of approximately $11.7 million. The net proceeds from these financings are being used to support the commercialization of LINZESS in the U.S. and to fund linaclotide and other development opportunities to advance our strategy to grow a leading commercial biotechnology company, in addition to other general corporate purposes.\nWe were incorporated in Delaware on January 5, 1998 as Microbia, Inc. On April 7, 2008, we changed our name to Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We currently operate in one reportable business segment-human therapeutics.\nTo date, we have dedicated substantially all of our activities to the research, development and commercialization of linaclotide, as well as to the research and development of our other product candidates. We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in 1998. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.1 billion. We are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or guarantee when, or if, our company will become cash flow positive.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenue. Revenue to date has been generated primarily through our collaboration agreements for the development and commercialization of linaclotide with Allergan for North America and AstraZeneca for China, Hong Kong and Macau, our license agreements for the development and commercialization of linaclotide in Japan with Astellas and the development and commercialization of linaclotide in Europe with Allergan (formerly with Almirall), and our co-promotion agreements with Allergan for VIBERZI and Exact Sciences for Cologuard in the U.S. The terms of these agreements contain multiple deliverables which may include (i) licenses, (ii) research and development activities, (iii) the manufacture of finished drug product, API or development materials for a partner which are reimbursed at a contractually determined rate, and (iv) co-promotion activities by our clinical sales specialists. Payments to us may include (i) up-front license fees, (ii) payments for research and development activities, (iii) payments for the manufacture of finished drug product, API or development materials, (iv) payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones, (v) payments for sales detailing, promotional support services and medical education initiatives and (vi) royalties on product sales. Additionally, we receive our share of the net profits or bear our share of the net losses from the sale of linaclotide in the U.S. and China. LINZESS launched in the U.S. in December 2012 and CONSTELLA became commercially available in certain European countries beginning in the second quarter of 2013. Linaclotide is also approved in a number of other countries.\nWe record our share of the net profits and losses from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. on a net basis and present the settlement payments to and from Allergan as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, as applicable. Net profits or losses consist of net sales to third-party customers and sublicense income in the U.S. less the cost of goods sold as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. Although we expect net sales to increase over time, the settlement payments between Allergan and us, resulting in collaborative arrangements revenue or collaboration expense, are subject to fluctuation based on the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by each party. In addition, our collaborative arrangements revenue may fluctuate as a result of the timing and amount of license fees and clinical and commercial milestones received and recognized under our current and future strategic partnerships as well as timing and amount of royalties from the sales of linaclotide in the European, Canadian or Mexican markets or any other markets where linaclotide receives approval. In October 2015, Almirall transferred its exclusive license to develop and commercialize linaclotide in Europe to Allergan. Concurrently with the European license transfer, Almirall and Allergan terminated the sublicense arrangement with respect to Mexico, returning the exclusive rights to commercialize CONSTELLA in Mexico to Allergan. CONSTELLA continues to be available to adult IBS-C patients in Mexico. Additionally, as described above, in October 2015 we and Allergan separately entered into an amendment to the license agreement relating to the development and commercialization of linaclotide in Europe. This amendment is more fully described in Note 4, Collaboration, License and Co-promotion Agreements, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue is recognized upon shipment of linaclotide API to certain of our licensing partners outside of the U.S. Our cost of revenue consists of the internal and external costs of producing such API.\nWrite-down of inventory to net realizable value and loss on non-cancelable purchase commitments. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded expenses of approximately $17.6 million for the write-down of inventory and an accrual for excess non-cancelable inventory purchase commitments related to linaclotide API. These charges primarily related to a reduction in the near term demand forecast for CONSTELLA in the European territory by Almirall; recent regulatory changes made by the CFDA to the marketing approval process in China; and the amendment to the license agreement with Allergan pertaining to the development and commercialization of linaclotide for Europe executed in October 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the amendment, Allergan assumed responsibility for the manufacturing of linaclotide API for Europe, as well as the associated costs, which resulted in accruing for a loss on non-cancelable inventory purchase commitments during the three months ended September 30, 2015, under one of our API supply agreements covering the commercial supply of linaclotide API for the European market. We have evaluated all remaining minimum purchase commitments under our linaclotide API supply agreements through 2023 and concluded that the approximately $22.3 million of purchase commitments from the second API supply agreement covering the Japan, China, Hong Kong and Macau markets are realizable based on the current forecasts received from our partners in these territories and our internal forecasts.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we wrote down approximately $20.3 million in inventory to an estimated net realizable value of approximately $5.0 million. This write down was primarily attributable to Almirall's reduced inventory demand forecasts, mainly due to the suspension of commercialization of CONSTELLA in Germany and a challenging commercial environment throughout Europe.\nThese charges are more fully described in Note 7, Inventory, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. These expenses\nconsist primarily of compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, research and development related facility costs, third-party contract costs relating to nonclinical study and clinical trial activities, development of manufacturing processes, regulatory registration of third-party manufacturing facilities, as well as licensing fees for our product candidates. We charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred. Under our collaboration agreements with Allergan for the U.S. and AstraZeneca for China, Hong Kong and Macau, we are reimbursed for certain research and development expenses, and we net these reimbursements against our research and development expenses as incurred. Payments to Allergan or AstraZeneca for such territories are recorded as incremental research and development expense.\nThe core of our research and development strategy is to leverage our development capabilities in addressing GI disorders as well as our pharmacologic expertise in GC pathways to bring multiple medicines to patients. We are advancing multiple product opportunities within two core therapeutic platforms: GI and vascular/fibrotic diseases.\nLinaclotide. Our lead product is linaclotide, and it represents the largest portion of our research and development expense for our product candidates. Linaclotide is the first and, to date, only FDA-approved guanylate cyclase type-C, or GC-C, agonist. Linaclotide is approved in the U.S. and in a number of E.U. and other countries.\nWe and Allergan are exploring development opportunities in the U.S. to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by seeking to expand its utility in its indicated populations, as well as studying linaclotide in additional indications, populations and formulations to assess its potential to treat various GI conditions. In October 2015, as part of this strategy, we reported positive top-line data from a Phase III clinical trial in the U.S. with Allergan evaluating a 72 mcg dose of linaclotide in adult patients with CIC. Additionally, in November 2015, the FDA approved the inclusion of labeling instructions in the full LINZESS Prescribing Information allowing adult IBS-C and CIC patients with swallowing difficulties the option to administer the contents of LINZESS capsules in applesauce or water.\nOur linaclotide development opportunities also include linaclotide colonic release, a targeted oral delivery formulation of linaclotide designed to potentially improve abdominal pain relief in adult IBS-C patients, as well as in patients with additional GI disorders where lower abdominal pain is a predominant symptom, such as IBS-M. Additionally, we and Allergan are evaluating linaclotide as a potential treatment of the GI dysfunction associated with opioid-induced constipation, or OIC, in adult patients and have established a plan with the FDA for clinical pediatric studies with linaclotide, as described below.\nDevelopment Candidates. We are advancing other development programs within our GI platform for indications such as refractory GERD and diabetic gastroparesis. This includes IW-9179, a GC-C agonist designed to target upper GI conditions, which is being explored for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia. Additionally, IW-3718 is a gastric retentive formulation of a bile acid sequestrant that is being evaluated for the potential treatment of refractory GERD.\nWithin our vascular/fibrotic platform, we are leveraging our pharmacological expertise in GC pathways gained through the discovery and development of linaclotide to advance development programs targeting sGC. To date, we have identified two sGC development candidates, IW-1973 and IW-1701, which have distinct pharmacologic profiles that we believe may be differentiating and enable opportunities in multiple indications. We have additional assets in early development that we continue to advance, and we are exploring strategic options for further development of these assets.\nDiscovery Research. Our discovery efforts are primarily focused on identifying novel clinical candidates that draw on our proprietary and expanding expertise in GI disorders and GC.\nThe following table sets forth our research and development expenses related to our product pipeline for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. These expenses relate primarily to external costs associated with nonclinical studies and clinical trial costs, costs incurred to develop manufacturing processes and register manufacturing facilities with the FDA, and licensing fees for our product candidates. We allocate costs related to facilities, depreciation, share-based compensation, research and development support services, laboratory supplies and certain other costs directly to programs.\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Years Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Linaclotide(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>48,981 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>48,340 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>46,048 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Development candidates:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GI disorders (three compounds)(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,152 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,068 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vascular and fibrotic disorders (two compounds)(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Central nervous system disorders (one compound)(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,793 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allergic disorders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>916 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total development candidates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,957 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,777 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discovery research\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,593 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,553 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>108,746 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>101,890 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>102,378 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes linaclotide in all indications, populations and formulations.\n(2)Number of compounds is for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nSince 2004, the date we began tracking costs by program, we have incurred approximately $355.7 million of research and development expenses related to linaclotide. The expenses for linaclotide include both our portion of the research and development costs incurred by Allergan for the U.S. and AstraZeneca for China, Hong Kong and Macau and invoiced to us under the cost-sharing provisions of our collaboration agreements, as well as the unreimbursed portion of research and development costs incurred by us under such cost-sharing provisions.\nThe lengthy process of securing regulatory approvals for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall. In August 2012, the FDA approved our New Drug Applications for LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC. In connection with the FDA approval, we are required to conduct certain nonclinical and clinical studies, including those aimed at understanding: (a) whether orally administered linaclotide can be detected in breast milk, (b) the potential for antibodies to be developed to linaclotide, and if so, (c) whether antibodies specific for linaclotide could have any therapeutic or safety implications. In addition, we and Allergan established a nonclinical and clinical post-marketing plan with the FDA to understand the efficacy and safety of LINZESS in pediatric patients. The first step in this plan was to undertake certain additional nonclinical studies. We and Allergan have completed these nonclinical studies and have initiated two Phase II clinical pediatric studies in IBS-C patients age seven to 17 and functional constipation patients age six to 17. We and Allergan are also exploring development opportunities to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by seeking to expand its utility within IBS-C and CIC, as well as studying linaclotide in additional indications, populations and formulations to assess its potential to treat various GI conditions. In October 2012, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca to co-develop and co-commercialize linaclotide in China, Hong Kong and Macau, with AstraZeneca having primary responsibility for the local operational execution. We cannot currently estimate with any degree of\ncertainty the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on linaclotide for other geographic markets, within its indicated population or in additional indications, populations or formulations. We are also advancing multiple other GI development programs targeting diseases such as refractory GERD and diabetic gastroparesis, as well as development programs within our vascular/fibrotic platform targeting sGC. Given the inherent uncertainties that come with the development of pharmaceutical products, we cannot estimate with any degree of certainty how our programs will evolve, and therefore the amount of time or money that would be required to obtain regulatory approval to market them. As a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of any approvals, we are currently unable to estimate precisely when, if ever, linaclotide's utility will be expanded in its indicated population; if or when linaclotide will be developed outside of its current markets, indications, populations or formulations; or when, if ever, any of our other product candidates will generate revenues and cash flows.\nWe invest carefully in our pipeline, and the commitment of funding for each subsequent stage of our development programs is dependent upon the receipt of clear, supportive data. In addition, we intend to access externally discovered drug candidates that fit within our core strategy. In evaluating these potential assets, we apply the same investment criteria as those used for investments in internally discovered assets.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 The duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate.\n\u2022 The FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial and varying requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products, typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures.\n\u2022 Data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activity. Data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.\n\u2022 The duration and cost of discovery, nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a product candidate and are difficult to predict.\n\u2022 The costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of a product candidate may not be favorable.\n\u2022 The emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments may negatively impact us.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, including the factors discussed under \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are unable to determine the duration and costs to complete current or future nonclinical and clinical stages of our product candidates or when, or to what extent, we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates. Development timelines, probability of success and development costs vary widely. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which additional programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the data of each product candidate, the competitive landscape and ongoing assessments of such product candidate's commercial potential. As a result of the regulatory approvals beginning in 2012, linaclotide has been generating sales in connection with commercial launches in the U.S. and a number of E.U. and other countries.\nWe expect our research and development costs will be substantial for the foreseeable future. We will continue to invest in linaclotide including the investigation of ways to enhance the clinical profile within its indicated population and the exploration of its utility in other indications, populations and formulations. We will also invest in our other product candidates as we advance them through nonclinical studies and clinical trials, in addition to funding full-time equivalents for research and development activities under our external collaboration and license agreements.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses for personnel in our administrative, finance, legal, information technology, business development, commercial, sales, marketing, communications and human resource functions. Other costs include the legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property, general and administrative related facility costs, insurance costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services. As we continue to invest in the commercialization of LINZESS, we expect our selling, general and administrative expenses will be substantial for the foreseeable future. We charge all selling, general and administrative expenses to operations as incurred.\nUnder our AstraZeneca collaboration agreement, we are reimbursed for certain selling, general and administrative expenses and we net these reimbursements against our selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. We include Allergan's selling, general and administrative cost-sharing payments in the calculation of the net profits and net losses from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S. and present the net payment to or from Allergan as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, respectively.\nCollaboration Expense. Collaboration expense represents settlement payments due to Allergan on 50% of LINZESS net sales in the U.S. as well as cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative cost-sharing settlement between us and Allergan.\nOther (Expense) Income. Interest expense consists primarily of cash and non-cash interest costs related to our outstanding PhaRMA Notes and the 2022 Notes. Non-cash interest expense consists of amortization of the debt discount and associated debt issuance costs associated with the PhaRMA Notes and 2022 Notes. We amortize these costs using the effective interest rate method over the life of the respective note agreements as interest expense in our statements of operations.\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nIn June 2015, in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions, or the Convertible Note Hedges. Concurrently with entering into the Convertible Note Hedges, we also entered into certain warrant transactions in which we sold note hedge warrants, or the Note Hedge Warrants, to the Convertible Note Hedge counterparties to acquire 20,249,665 shares of our Class A common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. Loss on derivatives consists of the change in fair value of the Convertible Note Hedges and Note Hedge Warrants, which are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities. The Convertible Note Hedges and the Note Hedge Warrants are recorded at fair value at each reporting period and changes in fair value are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Significant estimates and assumptions in our consolidated\nfinancial statements include those related to revenue recognition, available-for-sale securities, inventory valuation, and related reserves; impairment of long-lived assets; initial valuation procedures for the issuance of convertible notes; fair value of derivatives; balance sheet classification of notes payable and convertible notes; income taxes, including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets; research and development expenses; contingencies and share-based compensation. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known.\nWe believe that our application of the following accounting policies, each of which require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is generated primarily through collaborative research and development, licensing and co-promotion agreements. The terms of these agreements contain multiple deliverables which may include (i) licenses, (ii) research and development activities, including participation on joint steering committees, (iii) the manufacture of finished drug product, API or development materials for a partner, which are reimbursed at a contractually determined rate, and (iv) co-promotion activities by our clinical sales specialists. Non-refundable payments to us under these agreements may include (i) up-front license fees, (ii) payments for research and development activities, (iii) payments for the manufacture of finished drug product, API or development materials, (iv) payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones, (v) payments for sales detailing, promotional support services and medical education initiatives, and (vi) royalties on product sales. Additionally, we may receive our share of the net profits or bear our share of the net losses from the sale of linaclotide in the U.S. and China through our collaborations with Allergan and AstraZeneca, respectively.\nWe evaluate revenue from new agreements that have multiple elements under the guidance of Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, or ASU 2009-13. We also evaluate whether amendments to our multiple element arrangements are considered material modifications that are subject to the application of ASU 2009-13. This evaluation requires us to assess all relevant facts and circumstances and to make subjective determinations and judgments. As part of this assessment, we consider whether the modification results in a material change to the arrangement, including whether there is a change in total arrangement consideration that is more than insignificant, whether there are changes in the deliverables included in the arrangement, whether there is a change in the term of the arrangement and whether there is a significant modification to the delivery schedule for contracted deliverables.\nWe identify the deliverables included within multiple element agreements and evaluate which deliverables represent separate units of accounting. We account for those components as separate elements when the following criteria are met:\n\u2022 the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis; and\n\u2022 if there is a general right of return relative to the delivered items, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and within our control.\nThis evaluation requires subjective determinations and requires us to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. In determining the units of accounting, we evaluate certain criteria, including\nwhether the deliverables have standalone value, based on consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement. Factors considered in this determination include the research, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the partner and the availability of peptide research and manufacturing expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaborator can use the license or other deliverables for their intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining elements, and whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered items and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered items.\nThe consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units.\nWe determine the estimated selling price for deliverables using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available, third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Determining the BESP for a deliverable requires significant judgment. We use BESP to estimate the selling price for licenses to our proprietary technology, since we often do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price for these deliverables. In those circumstances where we utilize BESP to determine the estimated selling price of a license to our proprietary technology, we consider market conditions as well as entity-specific factors, including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements as well as internally developed models that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating our BESP, we evaluate whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple deliverables.\nWe recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.\nFor certain of our arrangements, particularly our license agreement with Allergan for the European territory, it is required that taxes be withheld on payments to us. We have adopted a policy to recognize revenue net of these tax withholdings.\nNet Profit or Net Loss Sharing\nThe determination of whether we should recognize revenue on a gross or net basis involves judgment based on the relevant facts and circumstances. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements, and ASC 605-45, Principal Agent Considerations, we consider the nature and contractual terms of the arrangement and the nature of our business operations to determine the classification of the transactions under our collaboration agreements. We record revenue transactions gross in the consolidated statements of operations if we are deemed the principal in the transaction, which includes being the primary obligor and having the risks and rewards of ownership.\nWe recognize our share of the pre-tax commercial net profit or net loss generated from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. in the period the product sales are reported by Allergan and related cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses are incurred by us and our collaboration partner. These amounts are partially determined based on amounts provided by Allergan and involve the use of estimates and judgments, such as product sales allowances and accruals related to prompt payment discounts, chargebacks, governmental and contractual rebates, wholesaler fees, product returns, and co-payment assistance costs, which could be adjusted based on actual results in the future. We are highly dependent on Allergan for timely and accurate information regarding any net revenues realized from sales of LINZESS in the U.S. and the costs incurred in selling it, in order to accurately\nreport our results of operations. For the periods covered in the consolidated financial statements presented, there have been no material changes to prior period estimates of revenues, cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. However, if we do not receive timely and accurate information or incorrectly estimate activity levels associated with the collaboration at a given point in time, we could be required to record adjustments in future periods.\nWe record our share of the net profits or net losses from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. on a net basis and present the settlement payments to and from Allergan as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, as applicable, as we are not the primary obligor and do not have the risks and rewards of ownership in the collaboration agreement with Allergan for North America. We and Allergan settle the cost sharing quarterly, such that our statement of operations reflects 50% of the pre-tax net profit or loss generated from sales of LINZESS in the U.S.\nUp-Front License Fees\nWe recognize revenues from nonrefundable, up-front license fees related to arrangements entered into prior to the adoption of ASU 2009-13, including the $30.0 million up-front license fee under the Astellas license agreement entered into in November 2009, on a straight-line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance since the license deliverables were not deemed to have value on a standalone basis under pre-ASU 2009-13 guidance and we could not determine the fair value of the undelivered elements. The period of performance over which the revenues are recognized is typically the period over which the research and/or development is expected to occur. As a result, we are required to make estimates regarding the drug development and commercialization timelines for compounds being developed pursuant to any applicable agreement. The determination of the length of the period over which to recognize the revenue is subject to judgment and estimation and can have an impact on the amount of revenue recognized in a given period. Quarterly, we reassess our period of substantial involvement over which we amortize our up-front license fees and make adjustments as appropriate. Our estimates regarding the period of performance under our collaborative research and development and licensing agreements have changed in the past and may change in the future. Any change in our estimates could result in substantial changes to our results for the period over which the revenues from an up-front license fee are recognized. In the event that an arrangement were to be terminated, we would recognize as revenue any portion of the up-front fee that had not previously been recorded as revenue, but was classified as deferred revenue at the date of such termination. At December 31, 2015, of our linaclotide collaboration and license arrangements, only a portion of Astellas' up-front license fee remained deferred. The up-front license fees under the Allergan collaboration for North America and the Allergan collaboration for Europe (previously with Almirall) were fully amortized at December 31, 2015, as the period of performance under those arrangements ended in the three months ended September 30, 2012.\nWe recognize revenue allocated to the license related to collaboration and license agreements entered into or materially modified, including the amounts allocated to the license under the AstraZeneca collaboration agreement entered into in October 2012, upon delivery, when we believe the license to our intellectual property has stand-alone value. When we recognize revenue allocated to the license upon delivery under any of our collaborations, we may experience significant fluctuations in our collaborative arrangements revenues from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the timing of transactions. When we believe the license to our intellectual property does not have stand-alone value from the other deliverables to be provided in the arrangement, it is combined with other deliverables and the revenue of the combined unit of accounting is recorded based on the method appropriate for the last delivered item.\nMilestones\nAt the inception of each arrangement that includes pre-commercial milestone payments, we evaluate whether each pre-commercial milestone is substantive, in accordance with ASU No. 2010-17, Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method, or ASU 2010-17. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a) the consideration is commensurate with either (1) the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, or (2) the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, (b) the consideration relates solely to past performance and (c) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone, the level of effort and investment required and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment. At December 31, 2015, we had no pre-commercial milestones that were deemed substantive. If a substantive pre-commercial milestone were achieved and collection of the related receivable was reasonably assured, we would recognize revenue related to the milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone was achieved. If we were to achieve milestones that we consider substantive under any of our collaborations, we may experience significant fluctuations in our collaborative arrangements revenue from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the timing of achieving such substantive milestones. In those circumstances where a pre-commercial milestone is not substantive, we recognize as revenue on the date the milestone is achieved an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the performance period that had elapsed as of the date the milestone was achieved, with the balance being deferred and recognized over the remaining period of performance. Pre-commercial milestone payments received prior to the adoption of ASU 2010-17 continue to be recognized over the remaining period of performance.\nCommercial milestones are accounted for as royalties and are recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nRoyalties on Product Sales\nWe receive, or expect to receive in the future, royalty revenues under certain of our license or collaboration agreements. If we do not have any future performance obligations under these license or collaborations agreements, we record these revenues as earned. To the extent we do not have access to the royalty reports from our partners or the ability to accurately estimate the royalty revenue in the period earned, we record such royalty revenues one quarter in arrears.\nOther\nWe produce finished drug product, API and development materials for certain of our partners.\nWe recognize revenue on finished drug product, API and development materials when the material has passed all quality testing required for collaborator acceptance, delivery has occurred, title and risk of loss have transferred to the collaborator, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. As it relates to development materials and API produced for Astellas, we are reimbursed at a contracted rate. Such reimbursements are considered as part of revenue generated pursuant to the Astellas license agreement and are presented as collaborative arrangements revenue. Any finished drug product, API and development materials currently produced for Allergan for the U.S. or AstraZeneca for China, Hong Kong and Macau are recognized in accordance with the cost-sharing provisions of the Allergan and AstraZeneca collaboration agreements, respectively. In October 2015, Almirall transferred its exclusive license to develop and commercialize linaclotide in Europe to Allergan, and we separately entered into an amendment to the license agreement with Allergan relating to the development and commercialization of linaclotide in Europe. Pursuant to the\nterms of the amendment, Allergan assumed responsibility for the manufacturing of linaclotide API for Europe from us, as well as the associated costs. We may experience fluctuations in our collaborative arrangements revenue from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the timing of such transactions.\nThe agreements above are more fully described in Note 4, Collaboration, License and Co-promotion Agreements, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe have certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and which have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurements. In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points in which there is little or no market data, which require us to develop our own assumptions for the asset or liability.\nOur investment portfolio includes mainly fixed income securities that do not always trade on a daily basis. As a result, the pricing services we use apply other available information as applicable through processes such as benchmark yields, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing to prepare valuations. In addition, model processes are used to assess interest rate impact and develop prepayment scenarios. These models take into consideration relevant credit information, perceived market movements, sector news and economic events. The inputs into these models may include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads and other relevant data. We validate the prices provided by our third party pricing services by obtaining market values from other pricing sources and analyzing pricing data in certain instances.\nWe classify our derivative financial instruments as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. These derivatives are not actively traded and are valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model which requires the use of subjective assumptions, primarily the expected stock price volatility assumption.\nInventory Valuation\nInventory is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first-in, first-out basis.\nWe evaluate inventory levels quarterly and any inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value, inventory that becomes obsolete, inventory in excess of expected sales requirements, inventory that fails to meet commercial sale specifications or is otherwise impaired is written down with a corresponding charge to the statement of operations in the period that the impairment is first identified. We also assess, on a quarterly basis, whether we have any excess non-cancelable purchase commitments resulting from our two minimum supply agreements with our suppliers of linaclotide API outside of North America. We rely on data from several sources to estimate the net realizable value of inventory and non-cancelable purchase commitments, including partner forecasts of projected inventory purchases that are received quarterly, our internal forecasts and related process, historical sales by geographic region, and the status of and progress toward commercialization of linaclotide in partnered territories.\nWe capitalize inventories manufactured in preparation for initiating sales of a product candidate when the related product candidate is considered to have a high likelihood of regulatory approval and the related costs are expected to be recoverable through sales of the inventories. In determining\nwhether or not to capitalize such inventories, we evaluate, among other factors, information regarding the product candidate's safety and efficacy, the status of regulatory submissions and communications with regulatory authorities and the outlook for commercial sales, including the existence of current or anticipated competitive drugs and the availability of reimbursement. In addition, we evaluate risks associated with manufacturing the product candidate, including the ability of our third-party suppliers to complete the validation batches, and the remaining shelf life of the inventories.\nCosts associated with developmental products prior to satisfying the inventory capitalization criteria are charged to research and development expense as incurred.\nThere is a risk inherent in these judgments and any changes in these judgments may have a material impact on our financial results in future periods.\nResearch and Development Expense\nAll research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. We defer and capitalize nonrefundable advance payments we make for research and development activities until the related goods are received or the related services are performed.\nResearch and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including salary, benefits and other employee-related expenses; share-based compensation expense; laboratory supplies and other direct expenses; facilities expenses; overhead expenses; third-party contractual costs relating to nonclinical studies and clinical trial activities and related contract manufacturing expenses, development of manufacturing processes and regulatory registration of third-party manufacturing facilities; licensing fees for our product candidates; and other outside expenses.\nClinical trial expenses include expenses associated with contract research organizations, or CROs. The invoicing from CROs for services rendered can lag several months. We accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with CRO activities based on our estimate of site management, monitoring costs, project management costs, and investigator fees. We maintain regular communication with our CRO vendors to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known. However, if we incorrectly estimate activity levels associated with the CRO services at a given point in time, we could be required to record material adjustments in future periods. Under our Allergan and AstraZeneca collaboration agreements for the U.S. and China, Hong Kong and Macau, respectively, we are reimbursed for certain research and development expenses and we net these reimbursements against our research and development expenses as incurred. Payments to Allergan or AstraZeneca for such territories are recorded as incremental research and development expense. Nonrefundable advance payments for research and development activities are capitalized and expensed over the related service period or as goods are received.\nShare-based Compensation Expense\nWe make certain assumptions in order to value and record expense associated with awards made under our share-based compensation arrangements. We estimate the fair value of the stock option awards for employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of our restricted stock unit, or RSU, awards is based on the market value of our Class A common stock on the date of grant. Determining the fair value of share-based awards requires the use of highly subjective assumptions, including expected term of the award and expected stock price volatility. For certain of these awards, we determine the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of performance targets, which requires judgment, including forecasting the achievement of future specified targets. Changes in these assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the amount of expense we recognize in connection with share-based payments.\nWe recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period based upon stock options that are ultimately expected to vest, and accordingly, such compensation expense is adjusted by the amount of estimated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures over the requisite service period when recognizing share-based compensation expense based on historical rates and forward-looking factors; these estimates are adjusted to the extent that actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to materially differ, from our estimates.\nWe have also granted time-accelerated stock options with terms that allow the acceleration in vesting of the stock options upon the achievement of performance-based milestones specified in the grants. Share-based compensation expense associated with these time-accelerated stock options is recognized over the requisite service period of the awards or the implied service period, if shorter.\nWhile the assumptions used to calculate and account for share-based compensation awards represent management's best estimates, these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if revisions are made to our underlying assumptions and estimates, our share-based compensation expense could vary significantly from period to period.\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\nIn June 2015, in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes, we entered into the Convertible Note Hedges. Concurrently with entering into the Convertible Note Hedges, we also entered into certain warrant transactions in which we sold Note Hedge Warrants to the Convertible Note Hedge counterparties to acquire 20,249,665 shares of our Class A common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. These instruments are derivative financial instruments under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging.\nThese derivatives are recorded as assets or liabilities at fair value each reporting period and the fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The changes in fair value are recorded as a component of other (expense) income in the consolidated statements of operations. Significant inputs used to determine the fair value include the price per share of our Class A common stock on the date of valuation, time to maturity of the derivative instruments, the strike prices of the derivative instruments, the risk-free interest rate, and the volatility of our Class A common stock. Changes to these inputs could materially affect the valuation of the Convertible Note Hedges and Note Hedge Warrants in future periods.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion summarizes the key factors our management believes are necessary for an understanding of our consolidated financial statements.\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The increase in revenue from collaborative arrangements of approximately $73.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily related to an approximately $85.8 million increase in our share of the net profits from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S.; an approximately $4.4 million increase due to revenues from our co-promotion agreement with Exact Sciences for Cologuard in the U.S. entered into in March 2015; an approximately $0.8 million increase in royalty revenue based on sales of linaclotide in our partnered territories; and an approximately $0.2 million increase due to revenues from our co-promotion agreement with Allergan for VIBERZI in the U.S. entered into in August 2015. The increases were partially offset by an approximately $8.1 million decrease in revenue recognized in connection with the achievement of a development milestone under our Astellas license agreement in 2014; an approximately $7.0 million decrease in revenue from the shipments of linaclotide API to our licensing partners; an approximately $1.9 million decrease in revenue recognized related to the achievement of commercial launch milestones under our license agreement with Almirall in 2014; and\nan approximately $1.1 million decrease in revenue related to our collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca.\nCost and Expenses\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(dollars in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost and expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>5,291 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(5,279 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (100 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Write-down of inventory to net realizable value and loss on non-cancellable purchase commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,654 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (13 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,856 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125,247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,914 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost and expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>251,643 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>245,806 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>5,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Revenue. The decrease in cost of revenue of approximately $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to lower sales of linaclotide API to our licensing partners.\nWrite-down of inventory to net realizable value and loss on non-cancelable purchase commitments. The decrease in write-down of inventory and loss on non-cancelable purchase commitments of approximately $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily related to an accrual for a loss on non-cancelable inventory purchase commitments recorded in the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by a decrease in the amount of inventory written down to estimated net realizable value.\nInventory represents linaclotide API that is available for commercial sale. We evaluate inventory levels quarterly and any inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value, inventory that becomes obsolete, inventory in excess of expected sales requirements, inventory that fails to meet commercial sale specifications or is otherwise impaired is written down with a corresponding charge to the statement of operations in the period that the impairment is first identified. As part of our net realizable value assessment of our inventory, we assess whether we have any excess non-cancelable purchase commitments resulting from our two minimum supply agreements with our suppliers of linaclotide API outside of North America.\nWe have entered into multiple commercial supply agreements for the purchase of linaclotide API. Two of our API supply agreements for supplying API to our collaboration partners outside of North America contain minimum purchase commitments. Prior to October 2015, we were also responsible for the manufacturing of linaclotide API for Europe. As part of our net realizable value assessment of our inventory, we assess whether we have any excess non-cancelable purchase commitments resulting from our minimum supply agreements with our suppliers of linaclotide API.\nThe determination of the net realizable value of inventory and non-cancelable purchase commitments is based on demand forecasts from our partners that are received quarterly, to project the next 24 months of demand and our internal forecast for projected demand in subsequent years. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, Almirall, our former European partner, reduced its forecasted purchases of linaclotide API for its territory for the subsequent 18 months. In addition, recent regulatory changes made by the CFDA to the marketing approval process in China resulted in a potentially lengthened approval timeline for the commercialization of linaclotide. The reduced demand from Almirall, and the potential extended timeline for commercialization of linaclotide in China, resulted in lower projected sales of linaclotide API to our partners in Europe and China. As a result,\nduring the three months ended June 30, 2015, we wrote-down the balance of our inventory of approximately $5.0 million to zero and accrued approximately $3.2 million for excess non-cancelable inventory purchase commitments.\nIn October 2015, Almirall transferred its exclusive license to develop and commercialize linaclotide in Europe to Allergan, and we separately entered into an amendment to the license agreement with Allergan relating to the development and commercialization of linaclotide in Europe. Pursuant to the terms of the amendment, Allergan assumed responsibility for the manufacturing of linaclotide API for Europe, as well as the associated costs. Upon the execution of the amendment to the license agreement, we recorded an incremental loss on non-cancelable API purchase commitments of approximately $6.9 million related to one of our API supply agreements covering the commercial supply of linaclotide API for the European market. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we also recorded an incremental loss on non-cancelable API purchase commitments related to in-process API batches. We have evaluated all remaining minimum purchase commitments under our linaclotide API supply agreements through 2023 and concluded that the approximately $22.3 million of purchase commitments from the second API supply agreement covering the Japan, China, Hong Kong and Macau markets are realizable based on the current forecasts received from our partners in these territories and our internal forecasts. These charges are more fully described in Note 7, Inventory, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we wrote down approximately $20.3 million in inventory to an estimated net realizable value of approximately $5.0 million. This write down was primarily attributable to Almirall's reduced inventory demand forecasts, mainly due to the suspension of commercialization of CONSTELLA in Germany and a challenging commercial environment throughout Europe.\nResearch and Development Expense. The increase in research and development expense of approximately $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily related to an increase of approximately $19.7 million in external costs related to the development of linaclotide; an increase of approximately $4.2 million in compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses primarily associated with increased headcount; and an increase of approximately $3.2 million in research costs related to our early stage pipeline candidates. The increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in costs related to the collaboration with Allergan for North America; a decrease of approximately $3.0 million related to our January 2014 workforce reduction; a decrease of approximately $1.8 million in operating costs, including information technology infrastructure costs and facility costs such as rent and amortization of leasehold improvements allocated to research and development; an approximately $1.6 million decrease in costs associated with the collaboration with AstraZeneca; and a decrease of approximately $1.2 million related to the development of manufacturing processes and costs associated with linaclotide API prior to meeting our inventory capitalization policy.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of an approximately $2.9 million increase in costs associated with selling expenses and marketing programs; an approximately $2.7 million increase in external consulting costs, patent-related legal costs and other service costs primarily associated with commercial activities to support linaclotide; an approximately $2.1 million increase in compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses; and an approximately $0.4 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to facilities and information technology infrastructure costs, including rent and amortization of leasehold improvements. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in costs of approximately $1.2 million related to our January 2014 workforce reduction.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(dollars in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (expense) income:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(31,096 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(21,166 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(9,930 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and investment income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on derivatives\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,928 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,928 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(661 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (100 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other (expense) income, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(40,581 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(20,248 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(20,333 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased approximately $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, mainly due to an increase in interest expense of approximately $10.9 million associated with our 2022 Notes. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $0.9 million in interest expense associated with the PhaRMA Notes for the year ended December 31, 2015, and an insignificant amount due to interest associated with capital leases for the automobiles for our field-based sales force and medical science liaisons.\nLoss on derivatives. The approximately $9.9 million increase in the net loss on derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 is due to an approximately $5.4 million decrease in the fair value of the Convertible Note Hedges and an approximately $4.5 million increase in the fair value of the Note Hedge Warrants since their issuance in June 2015.\nOther Income. The decrease in other income of approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 is primarily related to timing of the recognition of tax incentive awards that were recognized in the year ended December 31, 2014. In the year ended December 31, 2012, we were awarded an approximately $1.7 million tax incentive, associated with the Life Sciences Tax Incentive Program from the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized approximately $0.7 million as other income in the consolidated statement of operations, as we believed we had satisfied our job creation commitments related to this award for 2012 and 2013.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nRevenue\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(dollars in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaborative arrangements revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>76,436 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>22,881 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>53,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>234 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollaborative Arrangements Revenue.

The increases were partially offset by an approximately $4.7 million decrease in revenue from the shipments of linaclotide API to our licensing partners.\nCost and Expenses\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(dollars in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost and expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>5,291 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>7,203 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(1,912 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (27 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Write-down of inventory to net realizable value and loss on non-cancellable purchase commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(488 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (0 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,228 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,895 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (4 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,074 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42,074 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (100 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost and expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>245,806 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>274,883 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(29,077 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (11 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Revenue. The decrease in cost of revenue of approximately $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily attributable to lower sales of linaclotide API to our licensing partners.\nWrite-down of inventory to net realizable value and loss on non-cancelable purchase commitments. The increase in write-down of inventory and loss on non-cancelable purchase commitments of approximately $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was related to a write-down of approximately $20.3 million in inventory to an estimated net realizable value of approximately $5.0 million. This write-down was primarily attributable to Almirall's reduced inventory demand forecasts for the European territory, mainly due to the suspension of commercialization of CONSTELLA in Germany and a challenging commercial environment throughout Europe.\nResearch and Development Expense. The decrease in research and development expense of approximately $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily related to a decrease of approximately $5.5 million in compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses primarily associated with decreased average headcount; a decrease of approximately $5.0 million related to the development of manufacturing processes and costs associated with linaclotide API prior to meeting our inventory capitalization policy; a decrease of approximately $3.6 million in costs related to the collaboration with Allergan for North America; and a decrease of approximately $1.0 million in research costs related to our early stage pipeline candidates. The decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately $8.0 million in external costs related to the development of linaclotide; an increase of approximately $3.2 million in operating costs, including information technology infrastructure costs and facility costs such as rent and amortization of leasehold improvements allocated to research and development; an increase in costs of approximately $3.0 million related to our January 2014 workforce reduction; and an increase of approximately $0.4 million in costs related to the collaboration with AstraZeneca.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily as a result of an approximately $6.5 million decrease in external consulting and other service costs primarily associated with developing and maintaining the infrastructure to support linaclotide; an approximately $3.6 million decrease in costs associated with selling expenses and marketing programs; an approximately $1.5 million decrease in compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses associated with decreased average headcount; and an approximately $0.4 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses related to facilities and information technology infrastructure costs associated with operating our Cambridge, Massachusetts facility, including rent and amortization of leasehold improvements. The decreases were partially offset by an approximately $5.9 million increase in share-based compensation costs, of which approximately $2.3 million is related to the departure of an executive officer, and an increase in costs of approximately $1.2 million related to our January 2014 workforce reduction.\nCollaboration Expense. Collaboration expense decreased approximately $42.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of our share of higher LINZESS net sales in the U.S., which generated a payment from Allergan to us rather than a payment to Allergan.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(dollars in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (expense) income:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(21,166 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(21,002 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(164 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and investment income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other (expense) income, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(20,248 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(20,810 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense.

We have financed our operations to date primarily through both the private sale of our preferred stock and the public sale of our common stock, including approximately $203.2 million of net proceeds from our initial public offering, or IPO, in February 2010, and approximately $413.4 million of net proceeds from our follow-on public offerings; payments received under our strategic collaborative arrangements, including upfront and milestone payments,\nroyalties and our share of net profits, as well as reimbursement of certain expenses; and debt financings, including approximately $167.3 million of net proceeds from the private placement of our PhaRMA Notes in January 2013 and approximately $324.0 million of net proceeds from the private placement of our 2022 Notes in June 2015. At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $439.4 million of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Our cash equivalents include amounts held in money market funds and U.S. government-sponsored securities. Our available-for-sale securities include amounts held in U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. government-sponsored securities. We invest cash in excess of immediate requirements in accordance with our investment policy, which limits the amounts we may invest in any one type of investment and requires all investments held by us to be at least A+ rated, with a remaining maturity when purchased of less than twelve months, so as to primarily achieve liquidity and capital preservation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, our balances of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities increased approximately $191.1 million. This increase is primarily due to approximately $335.7 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of our 2022 Notes in June 2015, approximately $70.8 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of Note Hedge Warrants issued in connection with the 2022 Notes, and approximately $14.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of shares pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan. These cash inflows were partially offset by the purchase of Convertible Note Hedges for approximately $91.9 million in connection with our 2022 Notes and the payment of approximately $11.7 million of issuance costs in connection with our 2022 Notes, as well as the cash used to operate our business, including payments related to, among other things, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses as we continued to invest in our research pipeline and support the continued commercialization of LINZESS in the U.S. We also made principal payments of approximately $12.7 million on our outstanding PhaRMA Notes, invested approximately $4.0 million in capital expenditures, and made payments of approximately $1.3 million on capital lease obligations.\nCash Flows From Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities totaled approximately $106.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The primary uses of cash were our net loss of approximately $142.7 million and changes in assets and liabilities of approximately $38.2 million resulting primarily from an increase in related party accounts receivable principally attributable to higher amounts due from Allergan as a result of increased profits on the sale of LINZESS in the U.S., an increase in restricted cash associated with our salesforce vehicle fleet, a decrease in accounts payable, related party accounts payable and accrued expenses, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets, a decrease in deferred revenue, a decrease in deferred rent and an increase in accrued research and development costs. These uses of cash were primarily offset by non-cash items of approximately $74.0 million, including approximately $25.5 million in share-based compensation expense, approximately $17.6 million due to the write-down of inventory to net realizable value and loss on non-cancelable purchase commitments, approximately $11.6 million in depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment, approximately $8.1 million in non-cash interest expense, approximately $9.9 million due to the change in fair value of the Convertible Note Hedges and Note Hedge Warrants, and approximately $1.1 million in accretion of discounts and premiums on available-for-sale securities.\nNet cash used in operating activities totaled approximately $155.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The primary uses of cash were our net loss of approximately $189.6 million and changes in assets and liabilities of approximately $30.1 million resulting primarily from an increase in related party accounts receivable principally due to higher amounts due from Allergan due to increased profits on the sale of LINZESS in the U.S., an increase in purchases of linaclotide API, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and an increase in deferred rent. These uses of cash were partially offset by non-cash items of approximately $64.2 million, including approximately $26.2 million in share-\nbased compensation expense, approximately $20.3 million due to the write-down of inventory to net realizable value, approximately $12.3 million in depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment, approximately $2.6 million in losses on facility subleases, approximately $1.6 million in non-cash interest expense and approximately $1.1 million in accretion of discounts and premiums on available-for-sale securities.\nNet cash used in operating activities totaled approximately $273.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The primary uses of cash were our net loss of approximately $272.8 million and changes in assets and liabilities of approximately $35.7 million resulting primarily from a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses, including accrued research and development costs due to timing of payments, an increase in inventory for linaclotide API, a decrease in deferred revenue associated with the Astellas license agreement, a decrease in deferred rent and an increase accounts receivable. These uses of cash were partially offset by non-cash items of approximately $35.1 million, including approximately $19.8 million in share-based compensation expense, approximately $11.7 million in depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment, approximately $1.7 million in non-cash interest expense, approximately $1.3 million in accretion of discounts and premiums on available-for-sale securities and approximately $0.6 million in losses on the disposal of property and equipment.\nCash Flows From Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled approximately $9.2 million and resulted primarily from the purchase of approximately $282.0 million of available-for-sale securities and the purchase of approximately $4.0 million of property and equipment, primarily leasehold improvements and laboratory equipment. This was partially offset by the sales and maturities of approximately $276.7 million of available-for-sale securities and an insignificant amount of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaled approximately $56.6 million and resulted primarily from the purchase of approximately $254.0 million of available-for-sale securities and the purchase of approximately $3.5 million of property and equipment, primarily manufacturing and laboratory equipment as well as software to improve our information technology infrastructure. This was partially offset by the maturity of approximately $200.9 million in available-for-sale securities.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 totaled approximately $101.4 million and resulted primarily from the purchase of approximately $287.9 million of available-for-sale securities and the purchase of $9.6 million of property and equipment, primarily manufacturing and laboratory equipment as well as software to improve our information technology infrastructure. This was partially offset by the maturity of approximately $196.1 million in available-for-sale securities.\nCash Flows From Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled approximately $303.1 million and resulted primarily from approximately $324.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of our 2022 Notes in June 2015, approximately $70.8 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of the Note Hedge Warrants in connection with the 2022 Notes, approximately $14.2 million in cash provided by stock option exercises and the issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by approximately $91.9 million related to the purchase of the Convertible Note Hedges in connection with our 2022 Notes, approximately $12.7 million in cash used for principal payments on our outstanding PhaRMA Notes, and approximately $1.3 million in cash used for payments on our capital leases.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaled approximately $210.9 million and resulted primarily from approximately $190.4 million in net proceeds from our follow-on public stock offering in the first quarter of 2014 and approximately $22.7 million in cash provided by stock option exercises and the issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by approximately $1.2 million in cash used for principal payments on debt and approximately $1.0 million in cash used for payments on our capital leases.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 totaled approximately $313.6 million and resulted primarily from approximately $167.3 million in net proceeds from our debt financing in January 2013, approximately $137.8 million in net proceeds from our follow-on public stock offering in the second quarter of 2013 and approximately $9.3 million in cash provided by stock option exercises and the issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by approximately $0.8 million in cash used for payments on our capital leases.\nFunding Requirements\nWe began commercializing LINZESS in the U.S. with our collaboration partner, Allergan, in the fourth quarter of 2012, and we currently derive substantially all of our revenue from this collaboration. We are also deploying significant resources to advance product opportunities in GI and vascular/fibrotic diseases. Our goal is to become cash flow positive driven by increased revenue generated through sales of LINZESS and financial discipline. However, we have not achieved positive cash flows from operations to date.\nUnder our collaboration with Allergan for North America, total net sales of LINZESS in the U.S., as recorded by Allergan, are reduced by commercial costs incurred by each party, and the resulting amount is shared equally between us and Allergan. Additionally, we receive royalties based on sales of linaclotide in the European territory, Canada, and Mexico from Allergan. We believe revenues from our LINZESS partnership for the U.S. with Allergan will continue to constitute a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future and we cannot be certain that such revenues, as well as the revenues from our other commercial activities, will enable us to become cash flow positive, or to do so on the timeframes we expect. We also anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial expenses for the next several years as we further develop and commercialize linaclotide in the U.S., China and other markets, and continue to invest in our pipeline and potentially other external opportunities. We believe that our cash on hand as of December 31, 2015 will be sufficient to meet our projected operating needs at least through the next twelve months.\nOur forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations, including the underlying estimates regarding the costs to develop our product candidates and obtain regulatory approvals and the costs to commercialize linaclotide in the U.S., China and other markets, as well as our goal to become cash flow positive, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could vary materially and negatively from these and other forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed in the \"Risk Factors\" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\nDue to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate precisely the amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development of, and to obtain regulatory approval for, linaclotide (other than in the countries where it is already approved) and our other product candidates, or to commercialize linaclotide and our other product candidates, in each case, for all of the markets, indications, populations and formulations for which we believe each\nproduct candidate is suited. Our funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 the revenue generated by sales of LINZESS, CONSTELLA and any other products;\n\u2022 the rate of progress and cost of our commercialization activities, including the expense we incur in marketing and selling LINZESS and any other products;\n\u2022 the success of our third-party manufacturing activities;\n\u2022 the time and costs involved in developing, and obtaining regulatory approvals for, our product candidates;\n\u2022 the success of our research and development efforts;\n\u2022 the emergence of competing or complementary developments;\n\u2022 the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 the terms and timing of any additional collaborative, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish; and\n\u2022 the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies and the impact of other strategic transactions.\nFinancing Strategy\nWe may, from time to time, consider additional funding through a combination of new collaborative arrangements, strategic alliances, and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources. We will continue to manage our capital structure and to consider all financing opportunities, whenever they may occur, that could strengthen our long-term liquidity profile. Any such capital transactions may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past. There can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will also be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nContractual Commitments and Obligations\nLease and Commercial Supply Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our lease and commercial supply obligations at December 31, 2015 (excluding interest):\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Payments Due by Period </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less Than\n1 Year </th> <th> </th> <th>1 - 3 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>3 - 5 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>More Than\n5 Years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial supply obligations(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>32,440 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,259 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>9,641 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>11,252 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>9,288 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>338 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,422 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible senior notes due 2022 (including interest)(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>384,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>347,030 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>452,751 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>28,185 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>41,890 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>26,358 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>356,318 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)We have multiple commercial supply agreements with contract manufacturing organizations for the purchase of linaclotide finished drug product and API. Two of our API supply agreements for supplying API to our collaboration partners outside of North America contain minimum purchase\ncommitments, which are reflected in the table above. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized approximately $10.1 million of the commitments included in the table above, as an accrual for excess purchase commitments that is recorded in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, we and Allergan are jointly obligated to make minimum purchases of linaclotide API for the territories covered by our collaboration with Allergan for North America. Currently, Allergan fulfills all such minimum purchase commitments and, as a result, they are excluded from the table above.\n(2)Our commitment for capital lease obligations principally relates to leased automobiles for our field-based sales force and medical science liaisons, and computer and office equipment.\n(3)Our commitments for operating leases relate to our lease of office and laboratory space in Cambridge, Massachusetts and our data storage space in Boston, Massachusetts. In the third quarter of 2014, we entered into two arrangements, with the landlord's consent, to sublease a portion of our Cambridge, Massachusetts corporate headquarters. The future minimum lease payments included in this table do not reflect the $0.8 million of sublease rental income that we are entitled to receive through 2016 under the first sublease or the $11.1 million of sublease rental income that we are entitled to receive through 2018 under the second sublease.\n(4)Convertible senior notes includes approximately $335.7 million of our 2022 Notes which can potentially be settled in our common stock under the terms of the associated indenture.\nNotes Payable\nIn January 2013, we closed a private placement of $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 11% PhaRMA Notes due 2024. The notes bear an annual interest rate of 11%, with interest payable March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, each a Payment Date, which began on June 15, 2013. On March 15, 2014, we began making quarterly payments on the notes equal to the greater of (i) 7.5% of net sales of LINZESS in the U.S. for the preceding quarter, or the Synthetic Royalty Amount, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest on the notes, or the Required Interest Amount. Principal on the notes will be repaid in an amount equal to the Synthetic Royalty Amount minus the Required Interest Amount, when this is a positive number, until the principal has been paid in full. Given the principal payments on the notes are based on the net sales of LINZESS in the U.S., which will vary from quarter to quarter, the notes may be repaid prior to June 15, 2024, the final legal maturity date. We made principal payments of $13.9 million through December 31, 2015. Since we are unable to reliably estimate the exact timing and amounts of the principal payments, as discussed under \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the notes-related commitments are not included in the table above.\nIn June 2015, we issued approximately $335.7 million of 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2022. The 2022 Notes are governed by an indenture between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as the trustee, or the Indenture. The 2022 Notes are senior unsecured obligations and bear interest at a rate of 2.25% per year, payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year, which began on December 15, 2015. The 2022 Notes will mature on June 15, 2022, unless earlier converted or repurchased. The initial conversion rate for the 2022 Notes is 60.3209 shares of Class A common stock (subject to adjustment as provided for in the Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2022 Notes, which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $16.58 per share. In addition, to minimize the impact of potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the 2022 Notes, we entered into the Convertible Note Hedges covering 20,249,665 shares of our Class A common stock in connection with the 2022 Notes. Concurrently with entering into the Convertible Note Hedges, we sold Note Hedge Warrants to acquire 20,249,665 shares of our Class A common stock at an initial strike price of approximately $21.50 per share, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The 2022 Notes, Convertible Note Hedges and Note Hedge Warrants are more fully described in Note 10, Notes\nPayable, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nCommitments Related to Our Collaboration and License Agreements\nUnder our collaborative agreements with Allergan for North America and AstraZeneca for China, Hong Kong and Macau, we share with Allergan and AstraZeneca all development and commercialization costs related to linaclotide in the U.S. and for China, Hong Kong and Macau, respectively. The actual amounts that we pay our partners or that partners pay to us will depend on numerous factors outside of our control, including the success of our clinical development efforts with respect to linaclotide, the content and timing of decisions made by the regulators, the reimbursement and competitive landscape around linaclotide and our other product candidates, and other factors described under \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, we have commitments to make potential future milestone payments under one of our license and collaboration arrangements totaling $23.0 million, which includes $5.0 million for development milestones and $18.0 million for regulatory milestones. We are also committed to make potential future milestone payments of up to $114.5 million per product to one of our collaboration partners, including $21.5 million for development milestones, $58.0 million for regulatory milestones and $35.0 million for sales-based milestones. These milestones primarily include the commencement and results of clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval in various jurisdictions and the future commercial success of development programs, the outcome and timing of which are difficult to predict and subject to significant uncertainty. In addition to the milestones discussed above, we are obligated to pay royalties on future sales, which are contingent on generating levels of sales of future products that have not been achieved and may never be achieved. Since we are unable to reliably estimate the timing and amounts of such milestone and royalty payments, or whether they will occur at all, these contingent payments have been excluded from the table above. Our license and collaboration agreements are more fully described in Note 4, Collaboration, License and Co-promotion Agreements, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTax-related Obligations\nWe exclude liabilities or obligations pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual commitments and obligations as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2015, we have approximately $17.6 million of uncertain tax positions, and we cannot reasonably estimate the potential adjustment to our net operating loss carryforward. These uncertain tax positions are more fully described in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nOther Funding Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have several on-going studies in various clinical trial stages. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. The contracts with CROs generally are cancellable, with notice, at our option and do not have any significant cancellation penalties. These items are not included in the table above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in\nItem 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships. We enter into guarantees in the ordinary course of business related to the guarantee of our own performance and the performance of our subsidiaries.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of new accounting pronouncements refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of a commercial biotechnology company focusing on developing and commercializing medicines for gastrointestinal and vascular/fibrotic diseases. The company's primary product, linaclotide, is available in the U.S. and certain European countries. The company has entered into various partnerships and collaborations to advance its product portfolio globally. The report details the financial overview, including revenue sources, costs of revenue, write-down of inventory, research and development expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses, and collaboration expenses. It also outlines the company's efforts in development and commercialization, regulatory approvals, clinical trial data, and strategic agreements.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Information\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial biotechnology company leveraging our proven development and commercial capabilities as we seek to bring multiple medicines to patients. We are advancing two therapeutic platforms, which include product opportunities in areas of large unmet need, including irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, or IBS-C, and chronic idiopathic constipation, or CIC, vascular and fibrotic diseases, and refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD.\nOur first and to-date only commercial product, linaclotide, is available to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in the United States, or the U.S., under the trademarked name LINZESS\u00ae, and is available to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C in certain European\ncountries under the trademarked name CONSTELLA\u00ae. We and our U.S. partner Allergan plc (together with its affiliates), or Allergan (formerly Actavis plc), began commercializing LINZESS in the U.S. in December 2012. Under our collaboration with Allergan for North America, total net sales of LINZESS in the U.S., as recorded by Allergan, are reduced by commercial costs incurred by each party, and the resulting amount is shared equally between us and Allergan.\nOur former European partner, Almirall, S.A., or Almirall, began commercializing CONSTELLA in Europe for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe IBS-C in adults in the second quarter of 2013. In October 2015, Almirall transferred its exclusive license to develop and commercialize linaclotide in Europe to Allergan, and we and Allergan entered into an amendment to the European license agreement to modify the remaining sales-based milestones and royalties payable to us and to provide for Allergan's assumption of responsibility for, and cost of, the manufacturing of linaclotide active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for Europe from us. This amendment, together with the transfer of the European license for linaclotide from Almirall to Allergan, is more fully described in Note 4, Collaboration, License and Co-promotion Agreements, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Currently, CONSTELLA is commercially available in certain European countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain.\nWithin our gastrointestinal, or GI, platform, we and Allergan are exploring development opportunities to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by seeking to expand its utility within IBS-C and CIC, as well as studying linaclotide in additional indications and populations to assess its potential to treat various GI conditions. In October 2015, as part of this strategy, we reported positive top-line data from a Phase III clinical trial in the U.S. with Allergan evaluating a 72 mcg dose of linaclotide in adult patients with CIC. We believe these data support the submission of a supplemental new drug application, or sNDA, to the FDA for approval to market the 72 mcg dose of linaclotide in the U.S. If approved, the 72 mcg dose would provide a broader range of treatment options to physicians and adult CIC patients in the U.S. Linaclotide is also being developed and commercialized in other parts of the world by certain of our partners.\nWe and Allergan are also developing linaclotide colonic release, a targeted oral delivery formulation of linaclotide designed to potentially improve abdominal pain relief in adult IBS-C patients. In addition to IBS-C, we are exploring linaclotide colonic release for use in additional GI disorders where lower abdominal pain is a predominant symptom, including IBS-mixed, or IBS-M, ulcerative colitis and diverticulitis, among others.\nWe are also advancing other GI development programs for multiple indications. For example, we are investigating IW-3718, a gastric retentive formulation of a bile acid sequestrant that is being evaluated for the potential treatment of refractory GERD. We are also investigating IW-9179, a guanylate cyclase type-C, or GC-C, agonist designed to target upper GI conditions, for the treatment of gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia.\nWithin our vascular/fibrotic platform, we are leveraging our pharmacological expertise in guanylate cyclase, or GC, pathways gained through the discovery and development of linaclotide to advance development programs targeting soluble guanylate cyclase, or sGC. sGC is a validated mechanism with the potential for broad therapeutic utility and multiple opportunities for product development in vascular and fibrotic diseases, as well as other therapeutic areas. To date, we have identified two sGC development candidates, IW-1973 and IW-1701, which have distinct pharmacologic profiles that we believe may be differentiating and enable opportunities in multiple indications.\nAs part of our strategy, we have also established development and commercial capabilities that we plan to leverage as we seek to bring multiple medicines to patients. We intend to play an active role in the development and commercialization of our internally developed products in the U.S., and to establish a strong global brand by out-licensing commercialization rights in other territories to high-performing partners. In addition to the U.S. and Europe, we have entered into partnerships to develop and commercialize linaclotide in other parts of the world.\nIn December 2013 and February 2014, linaclotide was approved in Canada and Mexico, respectively, as a treatment for adult women and men suffering from IBS-C or CIC. Allergan has exclusive rights to commercialize linaclotide in Canada as CONSTELLA and, through a sublicense from Allergan, Almirall had exclusive rights to commercialize linaclotide in Mexico as LINZESS. In May 2014, Allergan began commercializing CONSTELLA in Canada and in June 2014, Almirall began commercializing LINZESS in Mexico. In October 2015, Almirall and Allergan terminated the sublicense arrangement with respect to Mexico, returning the exclusive rights to commercialize CONSTELLA in Mexico to Allergan. CONSTELLA continues to be available to adult IBS-C patients in Mexico.\nAstellas Pharma Inc., or Astellas, our partner in Japan, is developing linaclotide for the treatment of patients with IBS-C and chronic constipation in its territory. In November 2015, we and Astellas reported positive top-line data from Astellas' Phase III clinical trial of linaclotide in adult patients with IBS-C for Japan. We believe these data support the submission of a new drug application, or NDA, to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for approval to market linaclotide in Japan. In October 2012, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca AB, or AstraZeneca, to co-develop and co-commercialize linaclotide in China, Hong Kong and Macau, with AstraZeneca having primary responsibility for the local operational execution. In December 2015, we and AstraZeneca filed for approval with the China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA, to market linaclotide in China. We continue to assess alternatives to bring linaclotide to IBS-C and CIC sufferers in the parts of the world outside of our partnered territories.\nIn March 2015, we and Exact Sciences Corp, or Exact Sciences, entered into an agreement to co-promote Cologuard\u00ae, the first and only FDA-approved noninvasive stool DNA screening test for colorectal cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, our sales team is promoting and educating health care practitioners regarding Cologuard. We are also collaborating on medical education initiatives to support more in-depth understanding of Cologuard and the importance of colorectal cancer screening. Exact Sciences maintains responsibility for all other aspects of the commercialization of Cologuard outside of the co-promotion. We are compensated via reimbursements for sales detailing, promotional support services and medical education initiatives. We also earn royalties on the net sales of Cologuard generated from the healthcare practitioners on whom we call less the sales promotion reimbursement to us.\nIn August 2015, we and Allergan entered into an agreement for the co-promotion of VIBERZI\u2122 (eluxadoline) in the U.S., Allergan's treatment for adults suffering from IBS with diarrhea, or IBS-D. Under the terms of the agreement, our clinical sales specialists are detailing VIBERZI to the approximately 25,000 health care practitioners to whom they detail LINZESS. Allergan is responsible for all costs and activities relating to the commercialization of VIBERZI outside the co-promotion. Our promotional efforts are compensated based on the volume of calls delivered by our sales force, with the terms of the agreement reducing or eliminating certain of the unfavorable adjustments to the share of net profits stipulated by the linaclotide collaboration agreement with Allergan for North America, provided that we deliver a minimum number of VIBERZI calls on physicians. We are also compensated via reimbursement for medical education initiatives.\nIn November 2015, Allergan and Pfizer Inc. entered into a definitive agreement providing for the combination of the two companies. Our collaboration for the development and commercialization of linaclotide, as well as our agreement to co-promote VIBERZI, remains in effect.\nIn January 2013, we closed a private placement of $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 11% PhaRMA Notes due 2024, or the PhaRMA Notes. As a result of the debt offering, we received aggregate net proceeds, after offering expenses, of approximately $167.3 million. During the second quarter of 2013, we sold 11,204,948 shares of our Class A common stock through a firm commitment, underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $13.00 per share. As a result of the offering, we received aggregate net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses, of approximately $137.8 million. In February 2014, we sold 15,784,325 shares of our Class A common stock through a firm commitment, underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $12.75 per share. As a result of this offering, we received aggregate net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses, of approximately $190.4 million. In June 2015, we issued approximately $335.7 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022, or the 2022 Notes. We received net proceeds of approximately $324.0 million from the sale of the 2022 Notes, after deducting fees and expenses of approximately $11.7 million. The net proceeds from these financings are being used to support the commercialization of LINZESS in the U.S. and to fund linaclotide and other development opportunities to advance our strategy to grow a leading commercial biotechnology company, in addition to other general corporate purposes.\nWe were incorporated in Delaware on January 5, 1998 as Microbia, Inc. On April 7, 2008, we changed our name to Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We currently operate in one reportable business segment-human therapeutics.\nTo date, we have dedicated substantially all of our activities to the research, development and commercialization of linaclotide, as well as to the research and development of our other product candidates. We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in 1998. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.1 billion. We are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or guarantee when, or if, our company will become cash flow positive.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenue. Revenue to date has been generated primarily through our collaboration agreements for the development and commercialization of linaclotide with Allergan for North America and AstraZeneca for China, Hong Kong and Macau, our license agreements for the development and commercialization of linaclotide in Japan with Astellas and the development and commercialization of linaclotide in Europe with Allergan (formerly with Almirall), and our co-promotion agreements with Allergan for VIBERZI and Exact Sciences for Cologuard in the U.S. The terms of these agreements contain multiple deliverables which may include (i) licenses, (ii) research and development activities, (iii) the manufacture of finished drug product, API or development materials for a partner which are reimbursed at a contractually determined rate, and (iv) co-promotion activities by our clinical sales specialists. Payments to us may include (i) up-front license fees, (ii) payments for research and development activities, (iii) payments for the manufacture of finished drug product, API or development materials, (iv) payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones, (v) payments for sales detailing, promotional support services and medical education initiatives and (vi) royalties on product sales. Additionally, we receive our share of the net profits or bear our share of the net losses from the sale of linaclotide in the U.S. and China. LINZESS launched in the U.S. in December 2012 and CONSTELLA became commercially available in certain European countries beginning in the second quarter of 2013. Linaclotide is also approved in a number of other countries.\nWe record our share of the net profits and losses from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. on a net basis and present the settlement payments to and from Allergan as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, as applicable. Net profits or losses consist of net sales to third-party customers and sublicense income in the U.S. less the cost of goods sold as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. Although we expect net sales to increase over time, the settlement payments between Allergan and us, resulting in collaborative arrangements revenue or collaboration expense, are subject to fluctuation based on the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by each party. In addition, our collaborative arrangements revenue may fluctuate as a result of the timing and amount of license fees and clinical and commercial milestones received and recognized under our current and future strategic partnerships as well as timing and amount of royalties from the sales of linaclotide in the European, Canadian or Mexican markets or any other markets where linaclotide receives approval. In October 2015, Almirall transferred its exclusive license to develop and commercialize linaclotide in Europe to Allergan. Concurrently with the European license transfer, Almirall and Allergan terminated the sublicense arrangement with respect to Mexico, returning the exclusive rights to commercialize CONSTELLA in Mexico to Allergan. CONSTELLA continues to be available to adult IBS-C patients in Mexico. Additionally, as described above, in October 2015 we and Allergan separately entered into an amendment to the license agreement relating to the development and commercialization of linaclotide in Europe. This amendment is more fully described in Note 4, Collaboration, License and Co-promotion Agreements, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue is recognized upon shipment of linaclotide API to certain of our licensing partners outside of the U.S. Our cost of revenue consists of the internal and external costs of producing such API.\nWrite-down of inventory to net realizable value and loss on non-cancelable purchase commitments. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded expenses of approximately $17.6 million for the write-down of inventory and an accrual for excess non-cancelable inventory purchase commitments related to linaclotide API. These charges primarily related to a reduction in the near term demand forecast for CONSTELLA in the European territory by Almirall; recent regulatory changes made by the CFDA to the marketing approval process in China; and the amendment to the license agreement with Allergan pertaining to the development and commercialization of linaclotide for Europe executed in October 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the amendment, Allergan assumed responsibility for the manufacturing of linaclotide API for Europe, as well as the associated costs, which resulted in accruing for a loss on non-cancelable inventory purchase commitments during the three months ended September 30, 2015, under one of our API supply agreements covering the commercial supply of linaclotide API for the European market. We have evaluated all remaining minimum purchase commitments under our linaclotide API supply agreements through 2023 and concluded that the approximately $22.3 million of purchase commitments from the second API supply agreement covering the Japan, China, Hong Kong and Macau markets are realizable based on the current forecasts received from our partners in these territories and our internal forecasts.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we wrote down approximately $20.3 million in inventory to an estimated net realizable value of approximately $5.0 million. This write down was primarily attributable to Almirall's reduced inventory demand forecasts, mainly due to the suspension of commercialization of CONSTELLA in Germany and a challenging commercial environment throughout Europe.\nThese charges are more fully described in Note 7, Inventory, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. These expenses\nconsist primarily of compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, research and development related facility costs, third-party contract costs relating to nonclinical study and clinical trial activities, development of manufacturing processes, regulatory registration of third-party manufacturing facilities, as well as licensing fees for our product candidates. We charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred. Under our collaboration agreements with Allergan for the U.S. and AstraZeneca for China, Hong Kong and Macau, we are reimbursed for certain research and development expenses, and we net these reimbursements against our research and development expenses as incurred. Payments to Allergan or AstraZeneca for such territories are recorded as incremental research and development expense.\nThe core of our research and development strategy is to leverage our development capabilities in addressing GI disorders as well as our pharmacologic expertise in GC pathways to bring multiple medicines to patients. We are advancing multiple product opportunities within two core therapeutic platforms: GI and vascular/fibrotic diseases.\nLinaclotide. Our lead product is linaclotide, and it represents the largest portion of our research and development expense for our product candidates. Linaclotide is the first and, to date, only FDA-approved guanylate cyclase type-C, or GC-C, agonist. Linaclotide is approved in the U.S. and in a number of E.U. and other countries.\nWe and Allergan are exploring development opportunities in the U.S. to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by seeking to expand its utility in its indicated populations, as well as studying linaclotide in additional indications, populations and formulations to assess its potential to treat various GI conditions. In October 2015, as part of this strategy, we reported positive top-line data from a Phase III clinical trial in the U.S. with Allergan evaluating a 72 mcg dose of linaclotide in adult patients with CIC. Additionally, in November 2015, the FDA approved the inclusion of labeling instructions in the full LINZESS Prescribing Information allowing adult IBS-C and CIC patients with swallowing difficulties the option to administer the contents of LINZESS capsules in applesauce or water.\nOur linaclotide development opportunities also include linaclotide colonic release, a targeted oral delivery formulation of linaclotide designed to potentially improve abdominal pain relief in adult IBS-C patients, as well as in patients with additional GI disorders where lower abdominal pain is a predominant symptom, such as IBS-M. Additionally, we and Allergan are evaluating linaclotide as a potential treatment of the GI dysfunction associated with opioid-induced constipation, or OIC, in adult patients and have established a plan with the FDA for clinical pediatric studies with linaclotide, as described below.\nDevelopment Candidates. We are advancing other development programs within our GI platform for indications such as refractory GERD and diabetic gastroparesis. This includes IW-9179, a GC-C agonist designed to target upper GI conditions, which is being explored for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia. Additionally, IW-3718 is a gastric retentive formulation of a bile acid sequestrant that is being evaluated for the potential treatment of refractory GERD.\nWithin our vascular/fibrotic platform, we are leveraging our pharmacological expertise in GC pathways gained through the discovery and development of linaclotide to advance development programs targeting sGC. To date, we have identified two sGC development candidates, IW-1973 and IW-1701, which have distinct pharmacologic profiles that we believe may be differentiating and enable opportunities in multiple indications. We have additional assets in early development that we continue to advance, and we are exploring strategic options for further development of these assets.\nDiscovery Research. Our discovery efforts are primarily focused on identifying novel clinical candidates that draw on our proprietary and expanding expertise in GI disorders and GC.\nThe following table sets forth our research and development expenses related to our product pipeline for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. These expenses relate primarily to external costs associated with nonclinical studies and clinical trial costs, costs incurred to develop manufacturing processes and register manufacturing facilities with the FDA, and licensing fees for our product candidates. We allocate costs related to facilities, depreciation, share-based compensation, research and development support services, laboratory supplies and certain other costs directly to programs.\n\n(1)Includes linaclotide in all indications, populations and formulations.\n(2)Number of compounds is for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nSince 2004, the date we began tracking costs by program, we have incurred approximately $355.7 million of research and development expenses related to linaclotide. The expenses for linaclotide include both our portion of the research and development costs incurred by Allergan for the U.S. and AstraZeneca for China, Hong Kong and Macau and invoiced to us under the cost-sharing provisions of our collaboration agreements, as well as the unreimbursed portion of research and development costs incurred by us under such cost-sharing provisions.\nThe lengthy process of securing regulatory approvals for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall. In August 2012, the FDA approved our New Drug Applications for LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC. In connection with the FDA approval, we are required to conduct certain nonclinical and clinical studies, including those aimed at understanding: (a) whether orally administered linaclotide can be detected in breast milk, (b) the potential for antibodies to be developed to linaclotide, and if so, (c) whether antibodies specific for linaclotide could have any therapeutic or safety implications. In addition, we and Allergan established a nonclinical and clinical post-marketing plan with the FDA to understand the efficacy and safety of LINZESS in pediatric patients. The first step in this plan was to undertake certain additional nonclinical studies. We and Allergan have completed these nonclinical studies and have initiated two Phase II clinical pediatric studies in IBS-C patients age seven to 17 and functional constipation patients age six to 17. We and Allergan are also exploring development opportunities to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by seeking to expand its utility within IBS-C and CIC, as well as studying linaclotide in additional indications, populations and formulations to assess its potential to treat various GI conditions. In October 2012, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca to co-develop and co-commercialize linaclotide in China, Hong Kong and Macau, with AstraZeneca having primary responsibility for the local operational execution. We cannot currently estimate with any degree of\ncertainty the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on linaclotide for other geographic markets, within its indicated population or in additional indications, populations or formulations. We are also advancing multiple other GI development programs targeting diseases such as refractory GERD and diabetic gastroparesis, as well as development programs within our vascular/fibrotic platform targeting sGC. Given the inherent uncertainties that come with the development of pharmaceutical products, we cannot estimate with any degree of certainty how our programs will evolve, and therefore the amount of time or money that would be required to obtain regulatory approval to market them. As a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of any approvals, we are currently unable to estimate precisely when, if ever, linaclotide's utility will be expanded in its indicated population; if or when linaclotide will be developed outside of its current markets, indications, populations or formulations; or when, if ever, any of our other product candidates will generate revenues and cash flows.\nWe invest carefully in our pipeline, and the commitment of funding for each subsequent stage of our development programs is dependent upon the receipt of clear, supportive data. In addition, we intend to access externally discovered drug candidates that fit within our core strategy. In evaluating these potential assets, we apply the same investment criteria as those used for investments in internally discovered assets.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 The duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate.\n\u2022 The FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial and varying requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products, typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures.\n\u2022 Data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activity. Data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.\n\u2022 The duration and cost of discovery, nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a product candidate and are difficult to predict.\n\u2022 The costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of a product candidate may not be favorable.\n\u2022 The emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments may negatively impact us.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, including the factors discussed under \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are unable to determine the duration and costs to complete current or future nonclinical and clinical stages of our product candidates or when, or to what extent, we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates. Development timelines, probability of success and development costs vary widely. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which additional programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the data of each product candidate, the competitive landscape and ongoing assessments of such product candidate's commercial potential. As a result of the regulatory approvals beginning in 2012, linaclotide has been generating sales in connection with commercial launches in the U.S. and a number of E.U. and other countries.\nWe expect our research and development costs will be substantial for the foreseeable future. We will continue to invest in linaclotide including the investigation of ways to enhance the clinical profile within its indicated population and the exploration of its utility in other indications, populations and formulations. We will also invest in our other product candidates as we advance them through nonclinical studies and clinical trials, in addition to funding full-time equivalents for research and development activities under our external collaboration and license agreements.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses for personnel in our administrative, finance, legal, information technology, business development, commercial, sales, marketing, communications and human resource functions. Other costs include the legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property, general and administrative related facility costs, insurance costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services. As we continue to invest in the commercialization of LINZESS, we expect our selling, general and administrative expenses will be substantial for the foreseeable future. We charge all selling, general and administrative expenses to operations as incurred.\nUnder our AstraZeneca collaboration agreement, we are reimbursed for certain selling, general and administrative expenses and we net these reimbursements against our selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. We include Allergan's selling, general and administrative cost-sharing payments in the calculation of the net profits and net losses from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S. and present the net payment to or from Allergan as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, respectively.\nCollaboration Expense. Collaboration expense represents settlement payments due to Allergan on 50% of LINZESS net sales in the U.S. as well as cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative cost-sharing settlement between us and Allergan.\nOther (Expense) Income. Interest expense consists primarily of cash and non-cash interest costs", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Information\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial biotechnology company leveraging our proven development and commercial capabilities as we seek to bring multiple medicines to patients. We are advancing two therapeutic platforms, which include product opportunities in areas of large unmet need, including irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, or IBS-C, and chronic idiopathic constipation, or CIC, vascular and fibrotic diseases, and refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD.\nOur first and to-date only commercial product, linaclotide, is available to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in the United States, or the U.S., under the trademarked name LINZESS\u00ae, and is available to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C in certain European\ncountries under the trademarked name CONSTELLA\u00ae. We and our U.S. partner Allergan plc (together with its affiliates), or Allergan (formerly Actavis plc), began commercializing LINZESS in the U.S. in December 2012. Under our collaboration with Allergan for North America, total net sales of LINZESS in the U.S., as recorded by Allergan, are reduced by commercial costs incurred by each party, and the resulting amount is shared equally between us and Allergan.\nOur former European partner, Almirall, S.A., or Almirall, began commercializing CONSTELLA in Europe for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe IBS-C in adults in the second quarter of 2013. In October 2015, Almirall transferred its exclusive license to develop and commercialize linaclotide in Europe to Allergan, and we and Allergan entered into an amendment to the European license agreement to modify the remaining sales-based milestones and royalties payable to us and to provide for Allergan's assumption of responsibility for, and cost of, the manufacturing of linaclotide active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for Europe from us. This amendment, together with the transfer of the European license for linaclotide from Almirall to Allergan, is more fully described in Note 4, Collaboration, License and Co-promotion Agreements, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Currently, CONSTELLA is commercially available in certain European countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain.\nWithin our gastrointestinal, or GI, platform, we and Allergan are exploring development opportunities to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by seeking to expand its utility within IBS-C and CIC, as well as studying linaclotide in additional indications and populations to assess its potential to treat various GI conditions. In October 2015, as part of this strategy, we reported positive top-line data from a Phase III clinical trial in the U.S. with Allergan evaluating a 72 mcg dose of linaclotide in adult patients with CIC. We believe these data support the submission of a supplemental new drug application, or sNDA, to the FDA for approval to market the 72 mcg dose of linaclotide in the U.S. If approved, the 72 mcg dose would provide a broader range of treatment options to physicians and adult CIC patients in the U.S. Linaclotide is also being developed and commercialized in other parts of the world by certain of our partners.\nWe and Allergan are also developing linaclotide colonic release, a targeted oral delivery formulation of linaclotide designed to potentially improve abdominal pain relief in adult IBS-C patients. In addition to IBS-C, we are exploring linaclotide colonic release for use in additional GI disorders where lower abdominal pain is a predominant symptom, including IBS-mixed, or IBS-M, ulcerative colitis and diverticulitis, among others.\nWe are also advancing other GI development programs for multiple indications. For example, we are investigating IW-3718, a gastric retentive formulation of a bile acid sequestrant that is being evaluated for the potential treatment of refractory GERD. We are also investigating IW-9179, a guanylate cyclase type-C, or GC-C, agonist designed to target upper GI conditions, for the treatment of gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia.\nWithin our vascular/fibrotic platform, we are leveraging our pharmacological expertise in guanylate cyclase, or GC, pathways gained through the discovery and development of linaclotide to advance development programs targeting soluble guanylate cyclase, or sGC. sGC is a validated mechanism with the potential for broad therapeutic utility and multiple opportunities for product development in vascular and fibrotic diseases, as well as other therapeutic areas. To date, we have identified two sGC development candidates, IW-1973 and IW-1701, which have distinct pharmacologic profiles that we believe may be differentiating and enable opportunities in multiple indications.\nAs part of our strategy, we have also established development and commercial capabilities that we plan to leverage as we seek to bring multiple medicines to patients. We intend to play an active role in the development and commercialization of our internally developed products in the U.S., and to establish a strong global brand by out-licensing commercialization rights in other territories to high-performing partners. In addition to the U.S. and Europe, we have entered into partnerships to develop and commercialize linaclotide in other parts of the world.\nIn December 2013 and February 2014, linaclotide was approved in Canada and Mexico, respectively, as a treatment for adult women and men suffering from IBS-C or CIC. Allergan has exclusive rights to commercialize linaclotide in Canada as CONSTELLA and, through a sublicense from Allergan, Almirall had exclusive rights to commercialize linaclotide in Mexico as LINZESS. In May 2014, Allergan began commercializing CONSTELLA in Canada and in June 2014, Almirall began commercializing LINZESS in Mexico. In October 2015, Almirall and Allergan terminated the sublicense arrangement with respect to Mexico, returning the exclusive rights to commercialize CONSTELLA in Mexico to Allergan. CONSTELLA continues to be available to adult IBS-C patients in Mexico.\nAstellas Pharma Inc., or Astellas, our partner in Japan, is developing linaclotide for the treatment of patients with IBS-C and chronic constipation in its territory. In November 2015, we and Astellas reported positive top-line data from Astellas' Phase III clinical trial of linaclotide in adult patients with IBS-C for Japan. We believe these data support the submission of a new drug application, or NDA, to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for approval to market linaclotide in Japan. In October 2012, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca AB, or AstraZeneca, to co-develop and co-commercialize linaclotide in China, Hong Kong and Macau, with AstraZeneca having primary responsibility for the local operational execution. In December 2015, we and AstraZeneca filed for approval with the China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA, to market linaclotide in China. We continue to assess alternatives to bring linaclotide to IBS-C and CIC sufferers in the parts of the world outside of our partnered territories.\nIn March 2015, we and Exact Sciences Corp, or Exact Sciences, entered into an agreement to co-promote Cologuard\u00ae, the first and only FDA-approved noninvasive stool DNA screening test for colorectal cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, our sales team is promoting and educating health care practitioners regarding Cologuard. We are also collaborating on medical education initiatives to support more in-depth understanding of Cologuard and the importance of colorectal cancer screening. Exact Sciences maintains responsibility for all other aspects of the commercialization of Cologuard outside of the co-promotion. We are compensated via reimbursements for sales detailing, promotional support services and medical education initiatives. We also earn royalties on the net sales of Cologuard generated from the healthcare practitioners on whom we call less the sales promotion reimbursement to us.\nIn August 2015, we and Allergan entered into an agreement for the co-promotion of VIBERZI\u2122 (eluxadoline) in the U.S., Allergan's treatment for adults suffering from IBS with diarrhea, or IBS-D. Under the terms of the agreement, our clinical sales specialists are detailing VIBERZI to the approximately 25,000 health care practitioners to whom they detail LINZESS. Allergan is responsible for all costs and activities relating to the commercialization of VIBERZI outside the co-promotion. Our promotional efforts are compensated based on the volume of calls delivered by our sales force, with the terms of the agreement reducing or eliminating certain of the unfavorable adjustments to the share of net profits stipulated by the linaclotide collaboration agreement with Allergan for North America, provided that we deliver a minimum number of VIBERZI calls on physicians. We are also compensated via reimbursement for medical education initiatives.\nIn November 2015, Allergan and Pfizer Inc. entered into a definitive agreement providing for the combination of the two companies. Our collaboration for the development and commercialization of linaclotide, as well as our agreement to co-promote VIBERZI, remains in effect.\nIn January 2013, we closed a private placement of $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 11% PhaRMA Notes due 2024, or the PhaRMA Notes. As a result of the debt offering, we received aggregate net proceeds, after offering expenses, of approximately $167.3 million. During the second quarter of 2013, we sold 11,204,948 shares of our Class A common stock through a firm commitment, underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $13.00 per share. As a result of the offering, we received aggregate net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses, of approximately $137.8 million. In February 2014, we sold 15,784,325 shares of our Class A common stock through a firm commitment, underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $12.75 per share. As a result of this offering, we received aggregate net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses, of approximately $190.4 million. In June 2015, we issued approximately $335.7 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022, or the 2022 Notes. We received net proceeds of approximately $324.0 million from the sale of the 2022 Notes, after deducting fees and expenses of approximately $11.7 million. The net proceeds from these financings are being used to support the commercialization of LINZESS in the U.S. and to fund linaclotide and other development opportunities to advance our strategy to grow a leading commercial biotechnology company, in addition to other general corporate purposes.\nWe were incorporated in Delaware on January 5, 1998 as Microbia, Inc. On April 7, 2008, we changed our name to Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We currently operate in one reportable business segment-human therapeutics.\nTo date, we have dedicated substantially all of our activities to the research, development and commercialization of linaclotide, as well as to the research and development of our other product candidates. We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in 1998. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.1 billion. We are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or guarantee when, or if, our company will become cash flow positive.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenue. Revenue to date has been generated primarily through our collaboration agreements for the development and commercialization of linaclotide with Allergan for North America and AstraZeneca for China, Hong Kong and Macau, our license agreements for the development and commercialization of linaclotide in Japan with Astellas and the development and commercialization of linaclotide in Europe with Allergan (formerly with Almirall), and our co-promotion agreements with Allergan for VIBERZI and Exact Sciences for Cologuard in the U.S. The terms of these agreements contain multiple deliverables which may include (i) licenses, (ii) research and development activities, (iii) the manufacture of finished drug product, API or development materials for a partner which are reimbursed at a contractually determined rate, and (iv) co-promotion activities by our clinical sales specialists. Payments to us may include (i) up-front license fees, (ii) payments for research and development activities, (iii) payments for the manufacture of finished drug product, API or development materials, (iv) payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones, (v) payments for sales detailing, promotional support services and medical education initiatives and (vi) royalties on product sales. Additionally, we receive our share of the net profits or bear our share of the net losses from the sale of linaclotide in the U.S. and China. LINZESS launched in the U.S. in December 2012 and CONSTELLA became commercially available in certain European countries beginning in the second quarter of 2013. Linaclotide is also approved in a number of other countries.\nWe record our share of the net profits and losses from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. on a net basis and present the settlement payments to and from Allergan as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, as applicable. Net profits or losses consist of net sales to third-party customers and sublicense income in the U.S. less the cost of goods sold as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. Although we expect net sales to increase over time, the settlement payments between Allergan and us, resulting in collaborative arrangements revenue or collaboration expense, are subject to fluctuation based on the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by each party. In addition, our collaborative arrangements revenue may fluctuate as a result of the timing and amount of license fees and clinical and commercial milestones received and recognized under our current and future strategic partnerships as well as timing and amount of royalties from the sales of linaclotide in the European, Canadian or Mexican markets or any other markets where linaclotide receives approval. In October 2015, Almirall transferred its exclusive license to develop and commercialize linaclotide in Europe to Allergan. Concurrently with the European license transfer, Almirall and Allergan terminated the sublicense arrangement with respect to Mexico, returning the exclusive rights to commercialize CONSTELLA in Mexico to Allergan. CONSTELLA continues to be available to adult IBS-C patients in Mexico. Additionally, as described above, in October 2015 we and Allergan separately entered into an amendment to the license agreement relating to the development and commercialization of linaclotide in Europe. This amendment is more fully described in Note 4, Collaboration, License and Co-promotion Agreements, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue is recognized upon shipment of linaclotide API to certain of our licensing partners outside of the U.S. Our cost of revenue consists of the internal and external costs of producing such API.\nWrite-down of inventory to net realizable value and loss on non-cancelable purchase commitments. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded expenses of approximately $17.6 million for the write-down of inventory and an accrual for excess non-cancelable inventory purchase commitments related to linaclotide API. These charges primarily related to a reduction in the near term demand forecast for CONSTELLA in the European territory by Almirall; recent regulatory changes made by the CFDA to the marketing approval process in China; and the amendment to the license agreement with Allergan pertaining to the development and commercialization of linaclotide for Europe executed in October 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the amendment, Allergan assumed responsibility for the manufacturing of linaclotide API for Europe, as well as the associated costs, which resulted in accruing for a loss on non-cancelable inventory purchase commitments during the three months ended September 30, 2015, under one of our API supply agreements covering the commercial supply of linaclotide API for the European market. We have evaluated all remaining minimum purchase commitments under our linaclotide API supply agreements through 2023 and concluded that the approximately $22.3 million of purchase commitments from the second API supply agreement covering the Japan, China, Hong Kong and Macau markets are realizable based on the current forecasts received from our partners in these territories and our internal forecasts.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we wrote down approximately $20.3 million in inventory to an estimated net realizable value of approximately $5.0 million. This write down was primarily attributable to Almirall's reduced inventory demand forecasts, mainly due to the suspension of commercialization of CONSTELLA in Germany and a challenging commercial environment throughout Europe.\nThese charges are more fully described in Note 7, Inventory, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. These expenses\nconsist primarily of compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, research and development related facility costs, third-party contract costs relating to nonclinical study and clinical trial activities, development of manufacturing processes, regulatory registration of third-party manufacturing facilities, as well as licensing fees for our product candidates. We charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred. Under our collaboration agreements with Allergan for the U.S. and AstraZeneca for China, Hong Kong and Macau, we are reimbursed for certain research and development expenses, and we net these reimbursements against our research and development expenses as incurred. Payments to Allergan or AstraZeneca for such territories are recorded as incremental research and development expense.\nThe core of our research and development strategy is to leverage our development capabilities in addressing GI disorders as well as our pharmacologic expertise in GC pathways to bring multiple medicines to patients. We are advancing multiple product opportunities within two core therapeutic platforms: GI and vascular/fibrotic diseases.\nLinaclotide. Our lead product is linaclotide, and it represents the largest portion of our research and development expense for our product candidates. Linaclotide is the first and, to date, only FDA-approved guanylate cyclase type-C, or GC-C, agonist. Linaclotide is approved in the U.S. and in a number of E.U. and other countries.\nWe and Allergan are exploring development opportunities in the U.S. to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by seeking to expand its utility in its indicated populations, as well as studying linaclotide in additional indications, populations and formulations to assess its potential to treat various GI conditions. In October 2015, as part of this strategy, we reported positive top-line data from a Phase III clinical trial in the U.S. with Allergan evaluating a 72 mcg dose of linaclotide in adult patients with CIC. Additionally, in November 2015, the FDA approved the inclusion of labeling instructions in the full LINZESS Prescribing Information allowing adult IBS-C and CIC patients with swallowing difficulties the option to administer the contents of LINZESS capsules in applesauce or water.\nOur linaclotide development opportunities also include linaclotide colonic release, a targeted oral delivery formulation of linaclotide designed to potentially improve abdominal pain relief in adult IBS-C patients, as well as in patients with additional GI disorders where lower abdominal pain is a predominant symptom, such as IBS-M. Additionally, we and Allergan are evaluating linaclotide as a potential treatment of the GI dysfunction associated with opioid-induced constipation, or OIC, in adult patients and have established a plan with the FDA for clinical pediatric studies with linaclotide, as described below.\nDevelopment Candidates. We are advancing other development programs within our GI platform for indications such as refractory GERD and diabetic gastroparesis. This includes IW-9179, a GC-C agonist designed to target upper GI conditions, which is being explored for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia. Additionally, IW-3718 is a gastric retentive formulation of a bile acid sequestrant that is being evaluated for the potential treatment of refractory GERD.\nWithin our vascular/fibrotic platform, we are leveraging our pharmacological expertise in GC pathways gained through the discovery and development of linaclotide to advance development programs targeting sGC. To date, we have identified two sGC development candidates, IW-1973 and IW-1701, which have distinct pharmacologic profiles that we believe may be differentiating and enable opportunities in multiple indications. We have additional assets in early development that we continue to advance, and we are exploring strategic options for further development of these assets.\nDiscovery Research. Our discovery efforts are primarily focused on identifying novel clinical candidates that draw on our proprietary and expanding expertise in GI disorders and GC.\nThe following table sets forth our research and development expenses related to our product pipeline for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. These expenses relate primarily to external costs associated with nonclinical studies and clinical trial costs, costs incurred to develop manufacturing processes and register manufacturing facilities with the FDA, and licensing fees for our product candidates. We allocate costs related to facilities, depreciation, share-based compensation, research and development support services, laboratory supplies and certain other costs directly to programs.\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Years Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Linaclotide(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>48,981 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>48,340 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>46,048 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Development candidates:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GI disorders (three compounds)(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,152 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,068 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vascular and fibrotic disorders (two compounds)(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Central nervous system disorders (one compound)(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,793 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allergic disorders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>916 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total development candidates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,957 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,777 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discovery research\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,593 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,553 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>108,746 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>101,890 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>102,378 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes linaclotide in all indications, populations and formulations.\n(2)Number of compounds is for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nSince 2004, the date we began tracking costs by program, we have incurred approximately $355.7 million of research and development expenses related to linaclotide. The expenses for linaclotide include both our portion of the research and development costs incurred by Allergan for the U.S. and AstraZeneca for China, Hong Kong and Macau and invoiced to us under the cost-sharing provisions of our collaboration agreements, as well as the unreimbursed portion of research and development costs incurred by us under such cost-sharing provisions.\nThe lengthy process of securing regulatory approvals for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall. In August 2012, the FDA approved our New Drug Applications for LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC. In connection with the FDA approval, we are required to conduct certain nonclinical and clinical studies, including those aimed at understanding: (a) whether orally administered linaclotide can be detected in breast milk, (b) the potential for antibodies to be developed to linaclotide, and if so, (c) whether antibodies specific for linaclotide could have any therapeutic or safety implications. In addition, we and Allergan established a nonclinical and clinical post-marketing plan with the FDA to understand the efficacy and safety of LINZESS in pediatric patients. The first step in this plan was to undertake certain additional nonclinical studies. We and Allergan have completed these nonclinical studies and have initiated two Phase II clinical pediatric studies in IBS-C patients age seven to 17 and functional constipation patients age six to 17. We and Allergan are also exploring development opportunities to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by seeking to expand its utility within IBS-C and CIC, as well as studying linaclotide in additional indications, populations and formulations to assess its potential to treat various GI conditions. In October 2012, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca to co-develop and co-commercialize linaclotide in China, Hong Kong and Macau, with AstraZeneca having primary responsibility for the local operational execution. We cannot currently estimate with any degree of\ncertainty the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on linaclotide for other geographic markets, within its indicated population or in additional indications, populations or formulations. We are also advancing multiple other GI development programs targeting diseases such as refractory GERD and diabetic gastroparesis, as well as development programs within our vascular/fibrotic platform targeting sGC. Given the inherent uncertainties that come with the development of pharmaceutical products, we cannot estimate with any degree of certainty how our programs will evolve, and therefore the amount of time or money that would be required to obtain regulatory approval to market them. As a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of any approvals, we are currently unable to estimate precisely when, if ever, linaclotide's utility will be expanded in its indicated population; if or when linaclotide will be developed outside of its current markets, indications, populations or formulations; or when, if ever, any of our other product candidates will generate revenues and cash flows.\nWe invest carefully in our pipeline, and the commitment of funding for each subsequent stage of our development programs is dependent upon the receipt of clear, supportive data. In addition, we intend to access externally discovered drug candidates that fit within our core strategy. In evaluating these potential assets, we apply the same investment criteria as those used for investments in internally discovered assets.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 The duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate.\n\u2022 The FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial and varying requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products, typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures.\n\u2022 Data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activity. Data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.\n\u2022 The duration and cost of discovery, nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a product candidate and are difficult to predict.\n\u2022 The costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of a product candidate may not be favorable.\n\u2022 The emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments may negatively impact us.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, including the factors discussed under \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are unable to determine the duration and costs to complete current or future nonclinical and clinical stages of our product candidates or when, or to what extent, we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates. Development timelines, probability of success and development costs vary widely. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which additional programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the data of each product candidate, the competitive landscape and ongoing assessments of such product candidate's commercial potential. As a result of the regulatory approvals beginning in 2012, linaclotide has been generating sales in connection with commercial launches in the U.S. and a number of E.U. and other countries.\nWe expect our research and development costs will be substantial for the foreseeable future. We will continue to invest in linaclotide including the investigation of ways to enhance the clinical profile within its indicated population and the exploration of its utility in other indications, populations and formulations. We will also invest in our other product candidates as we advance them through nonclinical studies and clinical trials, in addition to funding full-time equivalents for research and development activities under our external collaboration and license agreements.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses for personnel in our administrative, finance, legal, information technology, business development, commercial, sales, marketing, communications and human resource functions. Other costs include the legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property, general and administrative related facility costs, insurance costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services. As we continue to invest in the commercialization of LINZESS, we expect our selling, general and administrative expenses will be substantial for the foreseeable future. We charge all selling, general and administrative expenses to operations as incurred.\nUnder our AstraZeneca collaboration agreement, we are reimbursed for certain selling, general and administrative expenses and we net these reimbursements against our selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. We include Allergan's selling, general and administrative cost-sharing payments in the calculation of the net profits and net losses from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S. and present the net payment to or from Allergan as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, respectively.\nCollaboration Expense. Collaboration expense represents settlement payments due to Allergan on 50% of LINZESS net sales in the U.S. as well as cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative cost-sharing settlement between us and Allergan.\nOther (Expense) Income. Interest expense consists primarily of cash and non-cash interest costs"}
