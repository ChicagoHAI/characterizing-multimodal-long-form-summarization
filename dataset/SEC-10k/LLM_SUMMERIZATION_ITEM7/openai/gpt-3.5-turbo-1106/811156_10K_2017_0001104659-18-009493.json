Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is a combined report of CMS Energy and Consumers.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nCMS Energy is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and CMS Enterprises, primarily a domestic independent power producer. Consumers' electric utility operations include the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity, and Consumers' gas utility operations include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas. Consumers' customer base consists of a mix of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers. CMS Enterprises, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, is engaged in domestic independent power production, the marketing of independent power production, and the development of renewable generation.\nCMS Energy and Consumers manage their businesses by the nature of services each provides. CMS Energy operates principally in three business segments: electric utility; gas utility; and enterprises, its non-utility operations and investments. Consumers operates principally in two business segments: electric utility and gas utility. CMS Energy's and Consumers' businesses are affected primarily by:\n\u00b7 regulation and regulatory matters\n\u00b7 state and federal legislation\n\u00b7 economic conditions\n\u00b7 weather\n\u00b7 energy commodity prices\n\u00b7 interest rates\n\u00b7 their securities' credit ratings\nThe Triple Bottom Line\nCMS Energy's and Consumers' purpose is to achieve world class performance while delivering hometown service. In support of this purpose, the companies employ the \u201cConsumers Energy Way,\u201d a lean operating model designed to improve safety, quality, cost, delivery, and employee morale.\nCMS Energy and Consumers measure their progress toward the purpose by considering their impact on the \u201ctriple bottom line\u201d of people, planet, and profit, which is underpinned by performance; this consideration takes into account not only the economic value that the companies create for customers and investors, but also their responsibility to social and environmental goals. The triple bottom line balances the interests of the companies' employees, customers, suppliers, regulators, creditors, Michigan's residents, the investment community, and other stakeholders, and it reflects the broader societal impacts of the companies' activities.\nConsumers' 2017 Sustainability Report, which is available to the public, describes the company's commitment to world class performance and to the triple bottom line and discusses its progress in the areas of safety, environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and economic development.\nPeople: The people element of the triple bottom line represents CMS Energy's and Consumers' commitment to their employees, their customers, the residents of local communities in which the companies do business, and other stakeholders.\nThe safety of employees, customers, and the general public is a priority of CMS Energy and Consumers. Accordingly, CMS Energy and Consumers have worked to integrate a set of safety principles into their business operations and culture. These principles include complying with applicable safety, health, and security regulations and implementing programs and processes aimed at continually improving safety and security conditions. The number of recordable safety incidents in 2017 was 65, compared with 73 in 2016 and 106 in 2015. The number of recordable safety incidents in 2017 was the lowest in Consumers' history, and Consumers is on track to have the best safety results of its EEI peer group, as it did in 2016.\nCMS Energy and Consumers also place a high priority on customer value and on providing a hometown customer experience. Consumers' customer-driven investment program is aimed at improving safety and increasing electric and gas reliability, which has resulted in measureable improvements in customer satisfaction.\nCentral to Consumers' commitment to its customers are the initiatives it has undertaken to keep electricity and natural gas affordable. These initiatives include the adoption of its lean operating model that is focused on completing work safely and correctly the first time, thus minimizing rework and waste, while delivering services on time. Other cost-saving initiatives undertaken by Consumers include:\n\u00b7 replacement of coal-fueled generation with cleaner and more efficient gas-fueled generation, renewable energy, and energy waste reduction and demand response programs\n\u00b7 targeted infrastructure investment, including the installation of smart meters\n\u00b7 information and control system efficiencies\n\u00b7 employee and retiree health care cost sharing\n\u00b7 workforce productivity enhancements\nIn addition, Consumers' gas commodity costs declined by 60 percent from 2007 through 2017, due not only to a decrease in market prices but also to Consumers' improvements to its gas infrastructure and optimization of its gas purchasing and storage strategy. These gas commodity savings are passed on to customers.\nPlanet: The planet element of the triple bottom line represents CMS Energy's and Consumers' commitment to protect the environment; this commitment extends beyond complying with the various state and federal environmental and health and safety laws and regulations to which CMS Energy and Consumers are subject. Consideration of climate change risk and other environmental risks is embedded in the companies' strategy, business planning, and enterprise risk management processes.\nCMS Energy and Consumers continue to focus on opportunities to reduce their carbon footprint by replacing coal-fueled generation with gas-fueled generation and renewable energy. In 2016, Consumers retired seven of its coal-fueled electric generating units, representing 33 percent of its owned coal-fueled generating capacity. As a result of these retirements and other actions taken by CMS Energy and Consumers, the companies' combined percentage of electric supply (self-generated and purchased) from coal has decreased by 16 percentage points since 2015.\nAdditionally, over the last 20 years, Consumers has reduced its sulfur dioxide emissions by 80 percent, its nitrogen oxide emissions by 90 percent, and its particulate matter emissions by 80 percent. Over the last ten years, Consumers has reduced its mercury emissions by 70 percent.\nGoing forward, Consumers will continue to invest in renewable generation and energy waste reduction programs in order to meet the requirements set by the 2016 Energy Law and to fulfill customer demand beyond the renewable energy standard. CMS Energy will continue to pursue further opportunities for the development of renewable generation projects through its non-utility businesses.\nThe 2016 Energy Law aligns with Consumers' clean and lean strategy, which focuses on increasing its generation of renewable energy, helping its customers use less energy, and offering demand response programs to reduce demand during critical peak times. Among other things, the 2016 Energy Law:\n\u00b7 raised the renewable energy standard from the present ten-percent requirement to 12.5 percent by 2019 and 15 percent by 2021\n\u00b7 established a goal of 35 percent combined renewable energy and energy waste reduction by 2025\n\u00b7 authorized incentives for demand response programs and expanded existing incentives for energy efficiency programs, referring to the combined initiatives as energy waste reduction programs\nIn a further effort to advance its environmental stewardship and to meet the requirements of present and future regulations, Consumers has adopted the following voluntary goals for air emissions, water use, and waste reduction:\n\u00b7 Committed to a 20-percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions intensity (pounds of carbon dioxide per MWh generated) by 2025 from a 2008 baseline. In 2016, Consumers achieved a reduction in total tons of carbon dioxide emitted of over 30 percent compared to 2008.\n\u00b7 Committed to a 20-percent reduction in water usage (gallons per MWh generated) by 2020, and surpassed that goal in 2017 with a 35-percent reduction in water used to generate electricity.\n\u00b7 Committed to a cumulative waste reduction goal of one million cubic yards of landfill space avoided by 2019, and met that goal in 2017.\nCMS Energy and Consumers are monitoring numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives, including those to regulate greenhouse gases, and related litigation. They are also monitoring potential changes in policies under the Trump administration. While CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the outcome of these matters, which could have a material effect on the companies, they intend to continue to move forward with their clean energy plan, their carbon reduction goals, and their emphasis on supply diversity.\nProfit: The profit element of the triple bottom line represents CMS Energy's and Consumers' commitment to meeting financial objectives and providing economic development opportunities and benefits in the communities in which they do business. CMS Energy's and Consumers' financial strength allows them to maintain solid investment-grade credit ratings and thereby reduce funding costs for the benefit of customers and investors, to preserve and create jobs, and to reinvest in the communities they serve.\nIn 2017, CMS Energy's net income available to common stockholders was $460 million, and diluted EPS were $1.64. This compares with net income available to common stockholders of $551 million and diluted EPS of $1.98 in 2016. In 2017, benefits from electric and gas rate increases and higher weather-adjusted electric and gas deliveries were more than offset by the impacts of the TCJA and by higher depreciation on increased plant in service. A more detailed discussion of the factors affecting CMS Energy's and Consumers' performance can be found in the Results of Operations section that follows this Executive Overview.\nConsumers projects that its total electric deliveries will remain stable or increase slightly through 2022, and that its gas deliveries will remain stable in 2018 and increase moderately through 2022. This outlook reflects growth in electric demand offset partially by energy waste reduction programs, and growth in gas demand offset partially by energy efficiency and conservation.\nPerformance: Impacting the Triple Bottom Line\nDuring 2017, CMS Energy's and Consumers' commitment to achieving world class performance while delivering hometown service resulted in the companies' best-ever performance in the areas of safety, service, and customer satisfaction. Leveraging the Consumers Energy Way, the companies met record-breaking goals in the areas of:\n\u00b7 lowering recordable safety incidents\n\u00b7 improving customer satisfaction scores\n\u00b7 decreasing the duration of customer outages\n\u00b7 responding faster to customer calls\n\u00b7 achieving on-time delivery commitments\n\u00b7 reading more meters monthly\n\u00b7 improving the accuracy of customer bills\n\u00b7 delivering energy efficiency solutions to customers\nCMS Energy and Consumers will continue to utilize the Consumers Energy Way to enable them to achieve world class performance and positively impact the triple bottom line. Consumers' investment plan and the regulatory environment in which it operates also drive its ability to impact the triple bottom line.\nInvestment Plan: Consumers expects to make significant expenditures on infrastructure upgrades and replacements and electric supply projects from 2018 through 2027. While it has a large number of potential investment opportunities that would add customer value, Consumers has prioritized its spending based on the criteria of enhancing public safety, increasing reliability, maintaining affordability for its customers, and advancing its environmental stewardship. Consumers' investment program is expected to result in annual rate-base growth of six to eight percent. This rate-base growth, together with cost-control initiatives, should allow Consumers to maintain sustainable customer base rate increases (excluding PSCR and GCR charges) at or below the rate of inflation.\nPresented in the following illustration are planned capital expenditures of $10.1 billion that Consumers expects to make from 2018 through 2022:\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Gas infrastructure\n($4.9 billion)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Electric distribution\n($3.5 billion)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Electric supply ($1.7 billion)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsumers plans to spend $8.4 billion over the next five years to maintain and upgrade its gas infrastructure and electric distribution systems in order to enhance reliability, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce energy waste on those systems. The gas infrastructure projects comprise $4.9 billion to sustain deliverability and enhance pipeline integrity and safety. These projects, which involve replacement of mains and services and enhancement of transmission and storage systems, should reduce the minor quantity of methane emissions released as gas is transported. The electric distribution projects comprise $3.5 billion to strengthen circuits and substations and replace poles. Consumers also expects to spend $1.7 billion on electric supply projects, representing new generation, including renewable generation, and environmental investments needed to comply with state and federal laws and regulations.\nRegulation: Regulatory matters are a key aspect of Consumers' business, particularly rate cases and regulatory proceedings before the MPSC, which permit recovery of new investments while helping to ensure that customer rates are fair and affordable. Important regulatory events and developments are summarized below.\n\u00b7 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: In December 2017, President Trump signed the TCJA, which changed existing federal tax law and included numerous provisions that affect businesses. Subsequently, the MPSC ordered all rate-regulated utilities in Michigan to report the impact that the new federal tax law will have on their customers. Consumers filed its response to the MPSC in January 2018, indicating that the TCJA reduces its annual electric revenue requirement by an estimated $116 million, and reduces its annual gas revenue requirement by an estimated $49 million. These amounts exclude potential refunds associated with Consumers' remeasurement of its deferred income taxes, which Consumers has proposed addressing in a future filing. In the January 2018 filing, Consumers recommended that the income tax benefits be provided to customers through a bill credit by the end of 2018. The timing and amortization period of any future rate adjustments or refunds are subject to change based on MPSC orders.\n\u00b7 Electric Rate Case: In March 2017, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $173 million, based on a 10.5 percent authorized return on equity. The filing requested authority to recover new investment in system reliability, environmental compliance, and technology enhancements. In September 2017, Consumers reduced its requested annual rate increase to $148 million. In October 2017, Consumers self-implemented an annual rate increase of $130 million, subject to refund with interest and potential penalties. A final order is expected by the end of March 2018.\n\u00b7 Gas Rate Case: In October 2017, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $178 million, based on a 10.5 percent authorized return on equity. The largest component of the request is an annual revenue requirement of $162 million related to infrastructure investment and related costs that will allow Consumers to improve system safety, capacity, and deliverability.\nThe filing also seeks approval of two rate adjustment mechanisms: a revenue decoupling mechanism and an investment recovery mechanism. The revenue decoupling mechanism would annually reconcile Consumers' actual weather-adjusted nonfuel revenues with the revenues approved by the MPSC. The investment recovery mechanism would provide for additional annual rate increases of $39 million beginning in July 2019 and another $39 million beginning in July 2020 for incremental investments that Consumers plans to make in those years, subject to reconciliation. These future investments are intended to help ensure adequate system capacity and deliverability. The MPSC previously approved an investment recovery mechanism in July 2017 that will be in effect until rates are changed in the pending proceeding.\n\u00b7 State Reliability Mechanism: In November 2017, the MPSC issued an order establishing a state reliability mechanism for Consumers, as directed by the 2016 Energy Law, which required that forward capacity be secured for all electric customers in Michigan, including customers served by alternative electric suppliers under ROA. Under Michigan law, electric customers in Consumers' service territory are allowed to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to ten percent of Consumers' weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year. Under the mechanism approved by the MPSC, beginning June 1, 2018, if an alternative electric supplier does not demonstrate that it has procured its capacity requirements for the four-year forward period, its customers will pay a set charge to the utility for capacity that is not provided by the alternative electric supplier.\nLooking Forward\nCMS Energy and Consumers will continue to consider the impact on the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit in their daily operations as well as in their long-term strategic decisions. Consumers will continue to seek fair and timely regulatory treatment that will support its customer-driven investment plan, while pursuing cost-control initiatives that will allow it to maintain sustainable customer base rates. The Consumers Energy Way is an important means of realizing CMS Energy's and Consumers' purpose of achieving world class performance while delivering hometown service.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCMS

common stockholders for 2017 versus 2016 and for 2016 versus 2015.\nElectric Deliveries and Rate Increases: For 2017, electric delivery revenues increased $55 million compared with 2016. This change reflected $82 million from a March 2017 rate increase and from an October 2017 self-implemented rate increase. Also contributing to the change were $13 million in higher revenues associated with the energy waste reduction program and a $10 million increase in the financial incentive associated with energy waste reduction performance standards. These increases were offset partially by a $45 million decrease in sales due primarily to mild weather and a $5 million reduction in other revenues. Deliveries to end-use customers were 37.4 billion kWh in 2017 and 37.9 billion kWh in 2016.\nFor 2016, electric delivery revenues increased $122 million compared with 2015. This change reflected $91 million from a December 2015 rate increase and from a September 2016 self-implemented rate increase, and a $62 million increase in sales due primarily to favorable weather. These increases were offset partially by a $25 million net decrease in securitization revenue, reflecting the conclusion in October 2015 of Consumers' 2001 securitization program, and a $6 million decrease in other revenues. Deliveries to end-use customers were 37.9 billion kWh in 2016 and 37.3 billion kWh in 2015.\nMaintenance and Other Operating Expenses: For 2017, maintenance and other operating expenses increased $7 million compared with 2016. This change reflected increases of $15 million in service restoration costs following severe storms, $13 million in energy waste reduction program costs, $8 million in information technology expenses, $6 million in demand response program costs, and $3 million in other operating and maintenance expenses. Also contributing to the change was the absence, in 2017, of a $4 million benefit associated with a Michigan use tax settlement in 2016. These increases were offset partially by $19 million in lower costs at Consumers' coal-fueled electric generating plants, due in part to the retirement of seven electric generating units in April 2016. Also contributing to the change were a $10 million reduction in postretirement benefit costs, a $7 million reduction in meter reading expense reflecting the implementation of smart meters, and an absence in 2017 of a $6 million charge associated with a 2016 voluntary separation program.\nFor 2016, maintenance and other operating expenses decreased $5 million compared with 2015. This change reflected a $27 million reduction in expenses at the seven coal-fueled electric generating units that Consumers retired in April 2016. Also contributing to the change were a $13 million reduction in uncollectible accounts expense due primarily to the successful implementation of new collection practices and a $4 million benefit associated with a Michigan use tax settlement. These decreases were offset partially by increases of $14 million in forestry expenses, $9 million of expenses related to the Jackson plant acquired in December 2015, an $8 million increase in postretirement benefit costs, a $6 million charge associated with a 2016 voluntary separation program, and a $2 million increase in other operating and maintenance expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization: For 2017, depreciation and amortization expense increased $51 million compared with 2016, due primarily to increased plant in service.\nFor 2016, depreciation and amortization expense increased $36 million compared with 2015. This change reflected a $94 million increase in depreciation expense related to increased plant in service and an increase in depreciation rates that became effective in December 2015, offset partially by a $58 million decrease in amortization of securitized assets, reflecting the conclusion in October 2015 of Consumers' 2001 securitization program.\nGeneral Taxes: For 2017, general taxes decreased $6 million compared with 2016. This change was due to a $10 million benefit from the settlement of a property tax appeal related to Consumers' Zeeland plant, offset partially by a $4 million increase in property taxes, reflecting higher capital spending.\nFor 2016, general taxes increased $15 million compared with 2015. This change was due primarily to increased property taxes, reflecting higher capital spending, and the absence, in 2016, of a benefit associated with a Michigan use tax settlement reached in 2015.\nOther Income, Net of Expenses: For 2017, other income, net of expenses, decreased $4 million compared with 2016. This change was due to a $15 million reduction in nonoperating retirement benefits credits, offset partially by the $6 million impact of benefit plan changes. Also contributing to the change was a $10 million increase in donations in 2017. These changes were offset partially by a $9 million gain on the donation of CMS Energy stock by Consumers, which was eliminated on CMS Energy's consolidated statements of income, and a $6 million increase in other income, net of expenses.\nFor 2016, other income, net of expenses, decreased $11 million compared with 2015. This change was due primarily to a $30 million increase in donations and a $2 million increase in other expenses. This change also reflected the absence, in 2016, of a $6 million benefit related to a Michigan use tax settlement reached in 2015, and a $6 million gain on a donation of CMS Energy stock by Consumers. The gain was eliminated on CMS Energy's consolidated statements of income. These changes were offset partially by a $33 million increase in nonoperating retirement benefits credits, attributable primarily to a change in the discount-rate methodology used to calculate postretirement benefit costs.\nInterest Charges: For 2017, interest charges increased $6 million compared with 2016, reflecting $2 million in higher PSCR interest expenses and a $4 million increase in other interest charges.\nFor 2016, interest charges increased $19 million compared with 2015. This change was due to the absence, in 2016, of a $12 million benefit associated with a Michigan use tax settlement reached in 2015. The change also reflected $7 million attributable primarily to higher average debt levels.\nIncome Taxes: For 2017, income taxes decreased $1 million compared with 2016. This change reflected the $11 million impact of a reduction in Consumers' effective state income tax rate. For additional details on this reduction in Consumers' effective state income tax rate, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 14, Income Taxes. Also contributing to the change were a $10 million decrease associated with lower non-deductible donations, a $3 million reduction due to lower electric utility earnings, and a $2 million decrease in other income taxes. These decreases were offset partially by a $25 million increase to recognize the impacts of the TCJA. For additional details on the TCJA, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 14, Income Taxes.\nFor 2016, income taxes increased $22 million compared with 2015. This change reflected $17 million attributable to higher electric utility earnings, a $6 million increase due to higher non-deductible donations, and $3 million of other tax-related items. These increases were offset partially by a $4 million decrease due to a change in the treatment of excess tax benefits on restricted stock awards as a result of the early adoption of a new accounting standard.\nConsumers Gas Utility Results of Operations\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> In Millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Years Ended December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income Available to Common Stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reasons for the change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gas deliveries and rate increases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maintenance and other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income, net of expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFollowing is a discussion of significant changes to net income available to common stockholders for 2017 versus 2016 and for 2016 versus 2015.\nGas Deliveries and Rate Increases: For 2017, gas delivery revenues increased $51 million compared with 2016. This change reflected a $27 million rate increase and a $20 million increase in sales due primarily to higher deliveries. Also contributing to the change were a $3 million increase in financial incentive associated with energy waste reduction performance standards and a $6 million increase in other revenues. These increases were offset partially by a $5 million reduction in revenues associated with the energy waste reduction program. Total deliveries to end-use customers were 287 bcf in 2017 and 282 bcf in 2016.\nFor 2016, gas delivery revenues increased $15 million compared with 2015. This change reflected $33 million from a January 2016 rate increase, offset partially by an $18 million decrease in sales due\nprimarily to milder winter weather. Deliveries to end-use customers were 282 bcf in 2016 and 299 bcf in 2015.\nMaintenance and Other Operating Expenses: For 2017, maintenance and other operating expenses decreased $21 million compared with 2016. This change reflected an $8 million decrease in postretirement benefit costs, $5 million in lower energy waste reduction program costs, the absence of a $4 million charge associated with a 2016 voluntary separation plan, and a $4 million decrease in other gas operating and maintenance expenses.\nFor 2016, maintenance and other operating expenses decreased $2 million compared with 2015. This change was due to an $8 million reduction in pipeline integrity expenses and a $7 million decrease in uncollectible accounts expense due primarily to the successful implementation of new collection practices. These decreases were offset partially by a $6 million increase in postretirement benefit costs, a $4 million charge associated with a 2016 voluntary separation program, and a $3 million increase in other gas operating and maintenance expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization: For 2017, depreciation and amortization expense increased $18 million compared with 2016, and for 2016, depreciation and amortization expense increased $23 million compared with 2015. Both increases were due primarily to higher depreciation expense from increased plant in service.\nGeneral Taxes: For 2017, general taxes increased $5 million compared with 2016, and for 2016, general taxes increased $7 million compared with 2015. Both increases were due to increased property taxes, reflecting higher capital spending.\nOther Income, Net of Expenses: For 2017, other income, net of expenses, decreased $8 million compared with 2016. This change was due to an $11 million reduction in nonoperating retirement benefits credits, offset partially by the $4 million impact of benefit plan changes. Also contributing to the change were $3 million in higher donations and $3 million in other expenses. These changes were offset partially by a $5 million gain on the donation of CMS Energy stock by Consumers, which was eliminated on CMS Energy's consolidated statements of income.\nFor 2016, other income, net of expenses, increased $11 million compared with 2015. This change was due to a $21 million increase in nonoperating retirement benefits credits and a $1 million decrease in other expenses. The increase in postretirement benefit credits was attributable primarily to a change in the discount-rate methodology used to calculate postretirement benefit costs. These changes were offset partially by an $8 million increase in donations and by the absence, in 2016, of a $3 million gain on a donation of CMS Energy stock by Consumers. The gain was eliminated on CMS Energy's consolidated statements of income.\nIncome Taxes: For 2017, income taxes increased $21 million compared with 2016. This change reflected increases of $15 million due to higher utility earnings, a $9 million increase to recognize the impacts of the TCJA, and $1 million in other income taxes. These changes were offset partially by the $4 million impact of a reduction in Consumers' effective state income tax rate. For additional details on the TCJA and on the reduction in Consumers' effective state income tax rate, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 14, Income Taxes.\nFor 2016, income taxes decreased $4 million compared with 2015. This reduction was due primarily to a change in the treatment of excess tax benefits on restricted stock awards as a result of the early adoption of a new accounting standard.\nEnterprises Results of Operations\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> In Millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Years Ended December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income (Loss) Available to Common Stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (27\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (44\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2017, net income of the enterprises segment decreased $44 million compared with 2016, due primarily to $57 million in higher income taxes due to the impacts of the TCJA, offset partially by a $13 million increase due primarily to higher prices for capacity and demand revenue from DIG. For additional details on the TCJA, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 14, Income Taxes.\nFor 2016, net income of the enterprises segment increased $13 million compared with 2015, due primarily to higher prices for capacity and demand revenue from DIG.\nCorporate Interest and Other Results of Operations\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> In Millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Years Ended December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Loss Available to Common Stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (141\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (79\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (62\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (79\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (72\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2017, corporate interest and other net expenses increased $62 million compared with 2016. This increase was due primarily to $57 million in higher income taxes due to the impacts of the TCJA, and the absence, in 2017, of a settlement reached with the Michigan Department of Treasury that resulted in a $2 million after-tax reduction in general taxes and a $3 million reduction in income tax expense. For additional details on the TCJA, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 14, Income Taxes. In addition, corporate interest and other net expenses also reflected the elimination in consolidation of a $9 million after-tax intercompany gain resulting from the donation of CMS Energy stock at Consumers. These changes were offset partially by lower fixed charges of $4 million, increases of $3 million at EnerBank, and lower administrative and other expenses of $2 million. In both 2017 and 2016, CMS Energy incurred an after-tax loss of $11 million on the early extinguishment of debt.\nFor 2016, corporate interest and other net expenses increased $7 million compared with 2015. This increase was due primarily to an $11 million after-tax loss on the early extinguishment of debt and $8 million of higher interest expense, reflecting higher debt levels. These increases were offset partially by a settlement reached with the Michigan Department of Treasury that resulted in a $2 million after-tax reduction in general taxes and a $3 million reduction in income tax expense, and by $1 million of higher earnings at EnerBank. Also contributing to the change were the absence, in 2016, of $6 million of\nadditional income tax expense attributable to higher Michigan Corporate Income Tax and to the establishment of a valuation allowance for certain tax credits.\nCASH POSITION, INVESTING, AND FINANCING\nAt December 31, 2017, CMS Energy had $204 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents, which included $22 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents.

These increases were due primarily to higher net income, net of non-cash transactions, which included the impacts of the TCJA. Also contributing to the increases were lower postretirement benefit contributions and higher collections from customers. These changes were offset partially by gas purchased at higher prices and increased spending on environmental remediation activities. The increase at Consumers also reflected lower tax payments to CMS Energy.\nFor 2016, net cash provided by operating activities at CMS Energy decreased $11 million compared with 2015 and net cash provided by operating activities at Consumers decreased $113 million compared with 2015. These changes were due primarily to lower customer collections, reflecting lower gas prices and sales volumes, offset partially by lower postretirement benefits contributions and higher net income. At Consumers, higher income tax payments to CMS Energy also contributed to the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2016.\nInvesting Activities\nPresented in the following table are specific components of net cash used in investing activities for 2017, 2016, and 2015:\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> In Millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Years Ended December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CMS Energy, including Consumers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,665\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,672\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,672\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,564\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (108\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in EnerBank notes receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (138\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (136\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (136\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (279\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from the sale of EnerBank notes receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (48\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DB SERP fund contribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Jackson plant acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (154\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs to retire property and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (108\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (107\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (107\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (90\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (17\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,868\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,915\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,915\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,064\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,632\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,656\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,656\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,537\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (119\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DB SERP fund contribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Jackson plant acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (154\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs to retire property and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (113\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (112\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (112\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (93\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (19\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,751\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,768\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,768\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,801\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2017, net cash used in investing activities at CMS Energy decreased $47 million compared with 2016 and net cash used in investing activities at Consumers decreased $17 million compared with 2016. At CMS Energy, the change was due to the sale of EnerBank notes receivable. At Consumers, the change was due to lower capital expenditures.\nFor 2016, net cash used in investing activities at CMS Energy decreased $149 million compared with 2015 and net cash used in investing activities at Consumers decreased $33 million compared with 2015. The changes were due primarily to the absence, in 2016, of the acquisition of the Jackson power plant and, at CMS Energy, decreased growth in EnerBank consumer lending.

financing activities at Consumers decreased $219 million compared with 2016. These changes were due primarily to higher repayments under Consumers' commercial paper program, an increase in debt retirements, and, at CMS Energy, lower issuances of certificates of deposit at EnerBank. These decreases were offset partially by higher debt issuances and, at Consumers, a higher stockholder contribution from CMS Energy.\nFor 2016, net cash provided by financing activities at CMS Energy decreased $208 million compared with 2015 and net cash provided by financing activities at Consumers increased $202 million compared with 2015. At CMS Energy, this change was due primarily to an increase in debt retirements and lower issuances of certificates of deposit at EnerBank, offset partially by higher debt issuances and higher repayments under Consumers' commercial paper program. At Consumers, a higher stockholder contribution from CMS Energy and an increase in debt issuances, offset partially by debt retirements, contributed to the increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 at Consumers.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nCMS Energy uses dividends and tax-sharing payments from its subsidiaries and external financing and capital transactions to invest in its utility and non-utility businesses, retire debt, pay dividends, and fund its other obligations. The ability of CMS Energy's subsidiaries, including Consumers, to pay dividends to CMS Energy depends upon each subsidiary's revenues, earnings, cash needs, and other factors. In addition, Consumers' ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain terms included in its debt covenants and articles of incorporation and potentially by FERC requirements and provisions under the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act. For additional details on Consumers' dividend restrictions, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 5, Financings and Capitalization-Dividend Restrictions. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Consumers paid $522 million in dividends on its common stock to CMS Energy.\nAs a result of a provision in the TCJA, CMS Energy is required to recover all alternative minimum tax credits over the next four years through offsets of regular tax and through cash refunds. CMS Energy expects to be able to offset regular tax through the use of federal net operating loss carryforwards and, accordingly, receive alternative minimum tax credit refunds through 2021. Another provision in the TCJA excludes rate-regulated utilities from 100 percent cost expensing of certain property after September 27, 2017. This provision will cause Consumers to make higher tax-sharing payments to CMS Energy during that period, which in turn might permit CMS Energy to maintain lower levels of debt in order to invest in its businesses, pay dividends, and fund its general obligations. To the extent that Consumers will be required to issue refunds to customers or reduce future customer rates as a result of the TCJA, Consumers expects to have sufficient funding sources available to meet this requirement.\nIn March 2017, CMS Energy entered into an updated continuous equity offering program. Under this program, CMS Energy may sell, from time to time in \u201cat the market\u201d offerings, common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $100 million. In June 2017, CMS Energy issued common stock under this program and received net proceeds of $70 million.\nConsumers uses cash flows generated from operations and external financing transactions, as well as stockholder contributions from CMS Energy, to fund capital expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, contribute to its employee benefit plans, and fund its other obligations. Accelerated pension funding in prior years and several initiatives to reduce costs have helped improve cash flows from operating activities. Consumers anticipates continued strong cash flows from operating activities for 2018 and beyond.\nAccess to the financial and capital markets depends on CMS Energy's and Consumers' credit ratings and on market conditions. As evidenced by past financing transactions, CMS Energy and Consumers have had ready access to these markets. Barring major market dislocations or disruptions, CMS Energy and Consumers expect to continue to have ready access to the financial and capital markets. If access to these markets were to diminish or otherwise become restricted, CMS Energy and Consumers would implement contingency plans to address debt maturities, which could include reduced capital spending.\nAt December 31, 2017, CMS Energy had $544 million of its secured revolving credit facility available and Consumers had $873 million available. CMS Energy and Consumers use these credit facilities for general working capital purposes and to issue letters of credit. An additional source of liquidity is Consumers' commercial paper program, which allows Consumers to issue, in one or more placements, up to $500 million in the aggregate in commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 365 days and that bear interest at fixed or floating rates. These issuances are supported by Consumers' revolving credit facilities. While the amount of outstanding commercial paper does not reduce the available capacity of the revolving credit facilities, Consumers does not intend to issue commercial paper in an amount exceeding the available capacity. At December 31, 2017, $170 million of commercial paper notes were outstanding under this program. For additional details on CMS Energy's and Consumers' secured revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 5, Financings and Capitalization.\nCertain of CMS Energy's and Consumers' credit agreements, debt indentures, and other facilities contain covenants that require CMS Energy and Consumers to maintain certain financial ratios, as defined therein. At December 31, 2017, no default had occurred with respect to any financial covenants contained in CMS Energy's and Consumers' credit agreements, debt indentures, or other facilities. CMS Energy and Consumers were each in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2017, as presented in the following table:\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Agreement, Indenture, or Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Limit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CMS Energy, parent only\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt to EBITDA1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> <\n</td> <td> 6.0 to 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.3 to 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt to Capital2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> <\n</td> <td> 0.65 to 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.47 to 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Applies to CMS Energy's $550 million revolving credit agreement and $225 million and $180 million term loan agreements.\n2 Applies to Consumers' $650 million and $250 million revolving credit agreements and its $68 million, $35 million, and $30 million reimbursement agreements.\nComponents of CMS Energy's and Consumers' cash management plan include controlling operating expenses and capital expenditures and evaluating market conditions for financing and refinancing opportunities. CMS Energy's and Consumers' present level of cash and expected cash flows from operating activities, together with access to sources of liquidity, are anticipated to be sufficient to fund the companies' contractual obligations for 2018 and beyond.\nContractual Obligations: Presented in the following table are CMS Energy's and Consumers' contractual obligations.

purchase of commodities and related services, and construction and service agreements. The commodities and related services include natural gas and coal with associated transportation.\n2 Long-term PPAs from certain affiliates of CMS Enterprises.\nCMS Energy and Consumers also have recognized non-current liabilities for which the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. These items, which are excluded from the table above, include regulatory liabilities, deferred income taxes, workers compensation liabilities, accrued liabilities under renewable energy programs, and other liabilities. Retirement benefits are also excluded from the table\nabove. For details related to benefit payments, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 12, Retirement Benefits.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements: CMS Energy, Consumers, and certain of their subsidiaries enter into various arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include indemnities, surety bonds, letters of credit, and financial and performance guarantees. Indemnities are usually agreements to reimburse a counterparty that may incur losses due to outside claims or breach of contract terms. The maximum payment that could be required under a number of these indemnity obligations is not estimable; the maximum obligation under indemnities for which such amounts were estimable was $153 million at December 31, 2017. While CMS Energy and Consumers believe it is unlikely that they will incur any material losses related to indemnities they have not recorded as liabilities, they cannot predict the impact of these contingent obligations on their liquidity and financial condition. For additional details on these and other guarantee arrangements, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 4, Contingencies and Commitments-Guarantees. For additional details on operating leases, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 10, Leases and Palisades Financing.\nCapital Expenditures: Over the next five years, CMS Energy and Consumers expect to make substantial capital investments. CMS Energy and Consumers may revise their forecasts of capital expenditures periodically due to a number of factors, including environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, and the ability to access capital.

These trends and uncertainties could have a material impact on CMS Energy's and Consumers' consolidated income, cash flows, or financial position. For additional details regarding these and other uncertainties, see Forward-Looking Statements and Information; Item 1A. Risk Factors; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 3, Regulatory Matters; and Note 4, Contingencies and Commitments.\nConsumers Electric Utility and Gas Utility Outlook and Uncertainties\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act: In December 2017, President Trump signed the TCJA, which changed existing federal tax law and included numerous provisions that affect businesses. Subsequently, the MPSC ordered all rate-regulated utilities in Michigan to report the impact that the new federal tax law will have on their customers. Consumers filed its response to the MPSC in January 2018, indicating that the TCJA reduces its annual electric revenue requirement by an estimated $116 million, and reduces its annual gas revenue requirement by an estimated $49 million. These amounts exclude potential refunds associated with\nConsumers' remeasurement of its deferred income taxes, which Consumers has proposed addressing in a future filing. In the January 2018 filing, Consumers recommended that the income tax benefits be provided to customers through a bill credit by the end of 2018. The timing and amortization period of any future rate adjustments or refunds are subject to change based on MPSC orders.\nEnergy Waste Reduction Plan: The 2016 Energy Law, which became effective in April 2017, authorized incentives for demand response programs and expanded existing incentives for energy efficiency programs, referring to the combined initiatives as energy waste reduction. The 2016 Energy Law:\n\u00b7 extended the requirement to achieve annual reductions of 1.0 percent in customers' electricity use through 2021 and 0.75 percent in customers' natural gas use indefinitely\n\u00b7 removed limits on investments under the program and provided for a higher return on those investments; together, these provisions effectively doubled the financial incentives Consumers may earn for exceeding the statutory targets\n\u00b7 established a goal of 35 percent combined renewable energy and energy waste reduction by 2025\nDuring 2017, the MPSC approved an energy waste reduction plan for Consumers that amended and expanded its existing energy optimization plan, allowing for recovery of increased investments to meet the requirements of the 2016 Energy Law and expanding the financial incentive that Consumers may earn for exceeding savings targets during the year. Under this plan, Consumers will continue to provide its customers with incentives to reduce usage by offering energy audits, rebates and discounts on purchases of highly efficient appliances, and other incentives and programs.\nSmart Energy and Gas AMR: In 2017, Consumers completed the full-scale deployment of 1.8 million smart meters throughout its service territory. Smart meters allow customers to monitor and manage their energy usage, which Consumers expects will help reduce demand during critical peak times, resulting in lower peak electric capacity requirements. In addition, Consumers is able to disconnect and reconnect service, read, and bill from smart meters remotely. Consumers will continue to add further functionality to its smart meters. Also in 2017, in areas where Consumers provides both electricity and natural gas to customers, it completed the deployment of communication modules on gas meters, installing 670,000 modules that will allow it to read and bill from gas meters remotely.\nIn areas where it provides only natural gas to customers, Consumers began the deployment of Gas AMR technology in 2017 and expects to complete it in 2019. Under this program, Consumers plans to install communication modules on 1.1 million gas meters, allowing it to conduct drive-by meter reading. As of December 31, 2017, Consumers had installed 96,000 communication modules.\nConsumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties\nEnergy Resource Planning: While Consumers continues to experience increasing demand for electricity due to Michigan's growing economy and increased use of air conditioning, consumer electronics, and other electric devices, it expects that increase in demand to be offset by the effects of energy efficiency and conservation. In order to address future capacity requirements, Consumers has developed a comprehensive clean energy plan designed to meet the short-term and long-term electricity needs of its customers. Presently, Consumers is reconsidering and realigning this plan in accordance with the integrated planning process established by the 2016 Energy Law. Consumers will file its integrated resource plan with the MPSC in mid-2018.\nIn April 2016, Consumers retired seven of its coal-fueled electric generating units, representing 950 MW of capacity. Even with the retirements of these units, Consumers expects to meet the capacity requirements of its full-service customers through:\n\u00b7 energy waste reduction\n\u00b7 expanded use of renewable energy\n\u00b7 the use of the Jackson plant, a 540-MW natural gas-fueled electric generating plant purchased in 2015\n\u00b7 construction or purchase of electric generating units\n\u00b7 continued operation or upgrade of existing units, including upgrades at Ludington\n\u00b7 renegotiations of existing PPAs\n\u00b7 purchases of short-term market capacity\nIn May 2017, Consumers reached an agreement with T.E.S. Filer City to amend their PPA in anticipation of the conversion of T.E.S. Filer City's plant to use natural gas as its primary fuel instead of coal. The conversion is expected to increase the amount of capacity and energy produced by the plant from 73 MW to 225 MW. Under the amendment to the PPA, Consumers will purchase the increased capacity and electricity generated by the converted facility for 15 years. The original PPA was set to expire in 2025. In February 2018, the MPSC approved the amendment to the PPA. The amendment is contingent on a finding by FERC that sales made under the amended PPA are exempt from, or authorized under, Section 205 of the Federal Power Act and on commercial operation of the converted facility on or before June 1, 2022.\nDuring 2017, Consumers issued a request for proposals to acquire a natural gas-fueled generating plant, and it completed an auction to purchase generation capacity. The request for proposals and the contracts entered into as a result of the auction were contingent on the anticipated early termination of Consumers' PPA with Entergy, under which Consumers purchases virtually all of the capacity and energy produced by Palisades. Following the MPSC's September 2017 order authorizing only partial recovery of the termination payment that Consumers had negotiated with Entergy, Consumers and Entergy agreed not to terminate the PPA, which is now expected to continue until April 2022 under its original terms. As a result, Consumers has rescinded the capacity contracts and is no longer pursuing any of the proposals received to acquire a natural gas-fueled generating plant. For additional details regarding the MPSC's order on the Palisades PPA, see the Electric Rate Matters discussion in this section.\nPURPA: PURPA requires Consumers to purchase power from qualifying cogeneration and small power production facilities at a price approved by the MPSC that is meant to represent Consumers' \u201cavoided cost\u201d of generating power or purchasing power from another source. In November 2017, the MPSC issued an order setting a new avoided-cost formula to determine the price that Consumers must pay to purchase power under PURPA. Among other things, the MPSC's order changes the basis of Consumers' avoided cost from the cost of coal-fueled generating units to that of natural gas-fueled generating units. The MPSC order also assigns more capacity value to qualifying facilities that are consistently able to generate electricity during peak times. Although the costs Consumers incurs to purchase power from qualifying facilities are passed on to customers, the order could result in mandated purchases of generation, potentially at above-market prices, and reduce Consumers' need for new owned generation. This in turn could have a material adverse effect on Consumers' capital investment plan and the affordability of future customer rates. In December 2017, Consumers filed a petition with the MPSC requesting corrections to the pricing calculations and capacity purchase model set in the order. In December 2017, the MPSC suspended the implementation of the order until the issues raised in Consumers' petition are resolved.\nRenewable Energy Plan: The 2016 Energy Law raised the renewable energy standard from the present ten-percent requirement to 15 percent in 2021, with an interim target of 12.5 percent in 2019. Consumers is required to submit RECs, which represent proof that the associated electricity was generated from a\nrenewable energy resource, in an amount equal to at least the required percentage of Consumers' electric sales volume each year. Under its renewable energy plan, Consumers expects to meet its renewable energy requirement each year with a combination of newly generated RECs and previously generated RECs carried over from prior years.\nIn conjunction with its renewable energy plan, in November 2017, Consumers began purchasing renewable capacity, energy, and RECs from a 100-MW wind park in Huron County, Michigan, under a 15-year PPA. In addition, Consumers obtained the MPSC's approval to construct two additional phases at its Cross Winds\u00ae Energy Park. Phase II of the park, with a nameplate capacity of 44 MW, became operational in January 2018. Consumers began construction of Phase III, with a planned nameplate capacity of 76 MW, in June 2017 and expects it to be operational in 2020. Both phases of the project are expected to qualify for certain federal production tax credits, which are expected to generate cost savings that will be passed on to customers.\nIn June 2017, Consumers issued requests for proposals to acquire wind and solar generation projects within MISO's service territory, specifically wind generation projects ranging in size from 100 MW to 200 MW and solar generation projects at least 10 MW in size. In September 2017, Consumers filed amendments to its renewable energy plan with the MPSC, requesting approval to acquire up to 525 MW of new wind generation projects and up to 100 MW of new solar generation projects in order to meet its renewable energy requirement. Any contracts entered into as a result of the request for proposals would be subject to MPSC approval.\nVoluntary Large Customer Renewable Energy Pilot Program: In May 2017, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC proposing a pilot program that would provide large full-service electric customers with the opportunity to advance the development of renewable energy beyond the requirements of the 2016 Energy Law. Under the pilot program, customers would have the ability to match up to 100 percent of their energy use with renewable energy generated from wind resources. In August 2017, the MPSC conditionally approved a portion of the pilot program through October 2018 and instructed Consumers to submit the program for review as a voluntary green pricing program under provisions of the 2016 Energy Law. Consumers submitted this program for review in October 2017.\nElectric Customer Deliveries and Revenue: Consumers' electric customer deliveries are seasonal and largely dependent on Michigan's economy. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment. In addition, Consumers' electric rates, which follow a seasonal rate design, are higher in the summer months than in the remaining months of the year.\nConsumers expects weather-adjusted electric deliveries to increase in 2018 by less than a half-percent compared with 2017. Over the next five years, Consumers plans conservatively for average electric deliveries to remain stable or increase slightly relative to 2017, as it expects that growth in electric demand will be offset partially by the effects of energy waste reduction programs and appliance efficiency standards. Actual delivery levels will depend on:\n\u00b7 energy conservation measures and results of energy waste reduction programs\n\u00b7 weather fluctuations\n\u00b7 Michigan's economic conditions, including utilization, expansion, or contraction of manufacturing facilities, population trends, and housing activity\nElectric ROA: Under Michigan law, electric customers in Consumers' service territory are allowed to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to ten percent of Consumers' weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year. At December 31, 2017, electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten-percent limit. Of Consumers' 1.8 million electric customers, 287 customers, or 0.02 percent, purchased electric generation service under the ROA program.\nThe 2016 Energy Law, which became effective in April 2017, retained the ten percent cap on ROA, with certain exceptions, but established a path to ensure that forward capacity is secured for all electric customers in Michigan, including customers served by alternative electric suppliers under ROA. The new law also authorized the MPSC to ensure that alternative electric suppliers have procured enough capacity to cover their anticipated capacity requirements for the four-year forward period. In November 2017, the MPSC issued an order establishing a state reliability mechanism for Consumers. Under this mechanism, beginning June 1, 2018, if an alternative electric supplier does not demonstrate that it has procured its capacity requirements for the four-year forward period, its customers will pay a set charge to the utility for capacity that is not provided by the alternative electric supplier.\nElectric Rate Matters: Rate matters are critical to Consumers' electric utility business. For additional details on rate matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 3, Regulatory Matters.\nPalisades PPA: In December 2016, Consumers agreed to pay Entergy $172 million to terminate their PPA in May 2018, four years ahead of schedule, contingent on the MPSC's approval. In September 2017, the MPSC issued an order authorizing Consumers to recover only $137 million of the $172 million termination payment. As a result, Consumers and Entergy agreed not to terminate the PPA, which is now expected to continue until April 2022 under its original terms.\nPSCR Plan: Consumers submitted its 2018 PSCR plan to the MPSC in September 2017 and, in accordance with its proposed plan, self-implemented the 2018 PSCR charge beginning in January 2018.\nDepreciation Rate Case: In 2016, Consumers filed a depreciation rate case related to its Ludington electric utility property, requesting to increase depreciation expense by $15 million annually. In July 2017, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing Consumers to recover an increase in depreciation expense of $2 million annually, based on December 31, 2015 balances. The new depreciation rates will go into effect with a final order in Consumers' next electric rate case following the electric rate case filed in 2017.\nElectric Environmental Outlook: Consumers' operations are subject to various state and federal environmental laws and regulations. Consumers estimates that it will incur capital expenditures of $0.4 billion from 2018 through 2022 to continue to comply with RCRA, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and numerous state and federal environmental regulations. Consumers expects to recover these costs in customer rates, but cannot guarantee this result. Consumers' primary environmental compliance focus includes, but is not limited to, the following matters.\nAir Quality: CSAPR, which became effective in 2015, requires Michigan and 27 other states to improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that, according to EPA computer models, contribute to ground-level ozone and fine particle pollution in other downwind states. In September 2016, the EPA finalized new ozone season standards for CSAPR, which became effective in May 2017. CSAPR is presently being litigated; however, any decision will not impact Consumers' compliance strategy, as Consumers expects its emissions to be within the CSAPR allowance allocations.\nIn 2012, the EPA published emission standards for electric generating units, based on Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, calling the final rule MATS. Under MATS, all of Consumers' existing coal-fueled electric generating units were required to add additional controls for hazardous air pollutants. Consumers met the extended deadline of April 2016 for five coal-fueled units and two oil/gas-fueled units it continues to operate and retired its seven remaining coal-fueled units. MATS is presently being litigated, but any decision is not expected to impact Consumers' MATS compliance strategy. In addition, Consumers must comply with the Michigan Mercury Rule and with its settlement agreement with the EPA entered into in 2014 concerning opacity and NSR.\nIn 2015, the EPA released its new rule to lower the NAAQS for ozone. The new ozone NAAQS will make it more difficult to construct or modify power plants in many areas of the country, including some parts of Michigan, if the areas are designated to be in nonattainment of the new standard. The NAAQS for ozone are presently being litigated and the EPA's decision on nonattainment areas is expected in 2018. Consumers is monitoring the designation process of this rule, as well as the litigation, but does not anticipate any impact on its electric generating units.\nConsumers' strategy to comply with air quality regulations, including CSAPR, NAAQS, and MATS, involved the installation and operation of emission control equipment at some facilities and the suspension of operations at others; however, Consumers continues to evaluate these rules in conjunction with other EPA rulemakings, litigation, and congressional action. This evaluation could result in:\n\u00b7 a change in Consumers' fuel mix\n\u00b7 changes in the types of generating units Consumers may purchase or build in the future\n\u00b7 changes in how certain units are used\n\u00b7 the retirement, mothballing, or repowering with an alternative fuel of some of Consumers' generating units\n\u00b7 changes in Consumers' environmental compliance costs\nGreenhouse Gases: There have been numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the state, regional, national, and international levels that involve the potential regulation of greenhouse gases. Consumers continues to monitor and comment on these initiatives and to follow litigation involving greenhouse gases.\nIn 2015, the EPA finalized new rules pursuant to Section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act to limit carbon dioxide emissions from new electric generating units. New coal-fueled units will not be able to meet this limit without installing carbon dioxide control equipment using such methods as carbon capture and sequestration. In addition, the EPA finalized new rules pursuant to Section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act to limit carbon dioxide emissions from modified or reconstructed electric generating units. Both of these rules are being litigated.\nAlso in 2015, the EPA published final rules pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing electric generating units, calling the rules the \u201cClean Power Plan.\u201d The rules required a 32-percent nationwide reduction in carbon emissions from existing power plants by 2030 (based on 2005 levels), and states choosing not to develop their own implementation plans would be subject to the federal plan. Certain states, corporations, and industry groups initiated litigation opposing the proposed Clean Power Plan, and in 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the Clean Power Plan while the litigation proceeded. In March 2017, the Trump administration issued an executive order directing the EPA and other federal agencies to review rules and policies that burden domestic energy production, including the Clean Power Plan. The EPA subsequently filed motions to hold the Section 111(b) and Clean Power Plan litigation in abeyance while it reconsiders the rule. In October 2017, the EPA published a proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan and is reviewing comments received. The EPA has also announced that it intends to begin the rulemaking process for a replacement rule that conforms to the new legal interpretation set forth in the published proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan. It is expected that the EPA will propose a replacement rule in 2018. Consumers does not expect that any changes to the Clean Power Plan will have an adverse impact on its environmental strategy.\nIn 2015, a group of 195 countries finalized the Paris Agreement, which governs carbon dioxide reduction measures beginning in 2020. Although the Trump administration has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, it has stated a desire to renegotiate a new agreement in the future. Consumers does not expect any adverse changes to its environmental strategy as a result of these events.\nWhile Consumers cannot predict the outcome of changes in policy under the Trump administration or of other legislative or regulatory initiatives involving the potential regulation of greenhouse gases, it intends\nto continue to move forward with its clean energy plan, its present carbon reduction target, and its emphasis on supply diversity. Consumers will continue to monitor regulatory activity regarding greenhouse gas emissions standards that may affect electric generating units.\nSevere weather events and climate change associated with increasing levels of greenhouse gases could affect the companies' facilities and energy sales and could have a material impact on the companies' future results of operations. Consumers is unable to predict these events or their financial impact; however, Consumers plans for adverse weather and takes steps to reduce its potential impact.\nLitigation, as well as federal laws, EPA regulations regarding greenhouse gases, or similar treaties, state laws, or rules, if enacted or ratified, could ultimately require Consumers to replace equipment, install additional emission control equipment, purchase emission allowances, curtail operations, arrange for alternative sources of supply, or take other steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases. Although associated capital or operating costs relating to greenhouse gas regulation or legislation could be material and cost recovery cannot be assured, Consumers expects to recover these costs and capital expenditures in rates consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations.\nCCRs: In 2015, the EPA published a final rule regulating CCRs, such as coal ash, under RCRA. The final rule adopts minimum standards for beneficially reusing and disposing of non-hazardous CCRs. The rule establishes new minimum requirements for site location, groundwater monitoring, flood protection, storm water design, fugitive dust control, and public disclosure of information. The rule also sets out conditions under which CCR units would be forced to cease receiving CCR and non-CCR waste and initiate closure based on the inability to achieve minimum safety standards, meet a location standard, or meet minimum groundwater standards. Consumers continues to develop work plans for submission to the MDEQ for concurrence to ensure coordination between federal and state requirements. Furthermore, Congress passed legislation in December 2016 that allows states to develop a permitting program for CCR under RCRA, and Michigan is taking steps to adopt such a program. As a result, Consumers may need to adjust its recorded ARO associated with coal ash disposal sites depending on the outcome of its submissions to the MDEQ and on a future RCRA permitting program under MDEQ, if the EPA approves a state-level program. Consumers has historically been authorized to recover in electric rates costs incurred related to cleanup and closure of coal ash disposal sites.\nWater: The EPA's rule to regulate existing electric generating plant cooling water intake systems under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act became effective in 2014. The rule is aimed at reducing alleged harmful impacts on fish and shellfish. In 2015, the EPA released its final effluent limitation guidelines. These guidelines, which are presently being litigated, set stringent new requirements for the discharge from electric generating units into wastewater streams. In August 2017, the EPA announced that it will undertake a rulemaking to replace specific portions of the rule. In September 2017, the EPA proposed delaying the compliance start dates for two years, but maintained the compliance end dates. Consumers does not expect any adverse changes to its environmental strategy as a result of any revisions to the rule.\nIn 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a final rule redefining \u201cwaters of the United States,\u201d which designates the EPA's jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. Numerous states and other interested parties, including Michigan's Attorney General, have filed suits in federal courts to block the rule, which subsequently was stayed in 2015 while litigation ensued. In January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the federal district courts, not the federal appellate courts, had jurisdiction over challenges to the 2015 rule, which is likely to result in the stay being lifted at the district court level. The EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are taking actions to rescind the rule and to revert to regulatory language that had been in effect prior to the 2015 rule. The 2015 rule changes the scope of water and wetlands regulations; however, the EPA has delegated authority to manage the Michigan wetlands program to the MDEQ. As a result, regardless of whether the 2015 rule is rescinded or maintained, Consumers will continue to operate under Michigan's wetlands regulations, and under the\napplicable state and federal water jurisdictional regulations. Thus, Consumers does not expect any adverse changes to its environmental strategy as a result of these events.\nMany of Consumers' facilities maintain NPDES permits, which are valid for five years and vital to the facilities' operations. Failure of the MDEQ to renew any NPDES permit, a successful appeal against a permit, or onerous terms contained in a permit could have a significant detrimental effect on the operations of a facility.\nOther Matters: Other electric environmental matters could have a material impact on Consumers' outlook. For additional details on other electric environmental matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 4, Contingencies and Commitments-Consumers Electric Utility Contingencies-Electric Environmental Matters.\nConsumers Gas Utility Outlook and Uncertainties\nGas Deliveries: Consumers' gas customer deliveries are seasonal. The peak demand for natural gas occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel. Consumers expects weather-adjusted gas deliveries to remain stable in 2018 compared with 2017. Over the next five years, Consumers expects average gas deliveries to increase moderately relative to 2017. This outlook reflects modest growth in gas demand offset partially by the predicted effects of energy efficiency and conservation. Actual delivery levels from year to year may vary from this expectation due to:\n\u00b7 weather fluctuations\n\u00b7 use by power producers\n\u00b7 availability and development of renewable energy sources\n\u00b7 gas price changes\n\u00b7 Michigan economic conditions, including population trends and housing activity\n\u00b7 the price of competing energy sources or fuels\n\u00b7 energy efficiency and conservation impacts\nGas Rate Matters: Rate matters are critical to Consumers' gas utility business. For additional details on rate matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 3, Regulatory Matters.\nGas Rate Case: In October 2017, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $178 million, based on a 10.5 percent authorized return on equity. The largest component of the request is an annual revenue requirement of $162 million related to infrastructure investment and related costs that will allow Consumers to improve system safety, capacity, and deliverability.\nThe filing also seeks approval of two rate adjustment mechanisms: a revenue decoupling mechanism and an investment recovery mechanism. The revenue decoupling mechanism would annually reconcile Consumers' actual weather-adjusted nonfuel revenues with the revenues approved by the MPSC. The investment recovery mechanism would provide for additional annual rate increases of $39 million beginning in July 2019 and another $39 million beginning in July 2020 for incremental investments that Consumers plans to make in those years, subject to reconciliation. These future investments are intended to help ensure adequate system capacity and deliverability. The MPSC previously approved an investment recovery mechanism in July 2017 that will be in effect until rates are changed in the pending proceeding.\nGas Transmission: In September 2016, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC to invest $610 million in the construction of a 95-mile, 24-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline in Saginaw, Genesee, and Oakland Counties, Michigan. The MPSC issued an order in March 2017 authorizing Consumers to construct and operate the pipeline. Consumers expects the pipeline to be operational by the end of 2020.\nGCR Plan: Consumers submitted its 2018-2019 GCR plan to the MPSC in December 2017 and, in accordance with its proposed plan, expects to self-implement the 2018-2019 GCR charge beginning in April 2018.\nGas Pipeline and Storage Integrity and Safety: In April 2016, PHMSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking that would expand federal safety standards for gas transmission pipelines. The rule could cause Consumers to incur increased capital costs to install and remediate pipelines as well as operating and maintenance costs to expand inspections, maintenance, and monitoring of its existing pipelines. PHMSA expects to publish a final rule in 2018.\nIn December 2016, PHMSA published an interim final rule that will establish minimum federal safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities. As proposed, the rule could cause Consumers to incur increased capital and operating and maintenance costs to expand inspections, maintenance, and monitoring of its underground gas storage facilities. PHMSA expects to publish a final rule in 2018.\nAlthough associated capital or operating and maintenance costs relating to these regulations could be material and cost recovery cannot be assured, Consumers would expect to recover such costs and capital expenditures in rates consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with laws and regulations. Consumers will continue to monitor gas safety regulations.\nGas Environmental Outlook: Consumers expects to incur response activity costs at a number of sites, including 23 former MGP sites. For additional details, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 4, Contingencies and Commitments-Consumers Gas Utility Contingencies-Gas Environmental Matters.\nEnterprises Outlook and Uncertainties\nThe primary focus with respect to CMS Energy's non-utility businesses is to maximize the value of their generating assets, which represent 1,102 MW of capacity, and to pursue opportunities for the development of renewable generation projects.\nT.E.S. Filer City plans to convert its plant to use natural gas as its primary fuel instead of coal. The conversion is expected to increase the amount of capacity and energy produced by the plant from 73 MW to 225 MW. In May 2017, in anticipation of the planned conversion, T.E.S. Filer City reached an agreement with Consumers to amend their PPA. Under the amendment to the PPA, Consumers will purchase the increased capacity and electricity generated by the converted facility for 15 years. The original PPA was set to expire in 2025. In February 2018, the MPSC approved the amendment to the PPA. The amendment is contingent on a finding by FERC that sales made under the amended PPA are exempt from, or authorized under, Section 205 of the Federal Power Act and on commercial operation of the converted facility on or before June 1, 2022.\nIn May 2017, CMS Enterprises completed construction of and began operating a 2.5-MW solar generation facility in Phillips, Wisconsin. Energy produced by the solar generation facility is sold through a 25-year PPA to Dairyland Power Cooperative, a non-affiliated company.\nIn September 2017, CMS Enterprises purchased two solar generation projects totaling 24 MW in Delta Township, Michigan. The projects are presently under development and are expected to be completed in 2018. Energy produced by the solar generation projects will be sold under 25-year PPAs to Lansing Board of Water and Light, a non-affiliated company.\nTrends, uncertainties, and other matters related to the enterprises segment that could have a material impact on CMS Energy's consolidated income, cash flows, or financial position include:\n\u00b7 changes in energy and capacity prices\n\u00b7 changes in commodity prices and interest rates on certain derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting and must be marked to market through earnings\n\u00b7 changes in various environmental laws, regulations, principles, or practices, or in their interpretation\n\u00b7 the outcome of certain legal proceedings, including gas price reporting litigation\n\u00b7 indemnity and environmental remediation obligations at Bay Harbor\n\u00b7 obligations related to a tax claim from the government of Equatorial Guinea\n\u00b7 representations, warranties, and indemnities provided by CMS Energy in connection with previous sales of assets\nFor additional details regarding the enterprises segment's uncertainties, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 4, Contingencies and Commitments.\nOther Outlook and Uncertainties\nEnerBank: EnerBank is a Utah state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial bank providing unsecured consumer installment loans for financing home improvements. EnerBank represented four percent of CMS Energy's net assets at December 31, 2017, and six percent of CMS Energy's net income available to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2017. The carrying value of EnerBank's loan portfolio was $1.4 billion at December 31, 2017. Its loan portfolio was funded primarily by certificates of deposit of $1.3 billion. The twelve-month rolling average net default rate on loans held by EnerBank was 1.2 percent at December 31, 2017. CMS Energy is required both by law and by contract to provide financial support, including infusing additional capital, to ensure that EnerBank satisfies mandated capital requirements and has sufficient liquidity to operate. With its self-funding plan, EnerBank has exceeded these requirements historically and exceeded them as of December 31, 2017.\nLitigation: CMS Energy, Consumers, and certain of their subsidiaries are named as parties in various litigation matters, as well as in administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental agencies, arising in the ordinary course of business. For additional details regarding these and other legal matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 3, Regulatory Matters and Note 4, Contingencies and Commitments.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe following information is important to understand CMS Energy's and Consumers' results of operations and financial condition. For additional accounting policies, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies.\nIn the preparation of CMS Energy's and Consumers' consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions are used that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. CMS Energy and Consumers use accounting estimates for asset valuations, unbilled revenue, depreciation, amortization, financial and derivative instruments, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, the effects of regulation, indemnities, and contingencies. Actual results may differ from estimated results due to changes in the regulatory environment, regulatory decisions, lawsuits, competition, and other factors. CMS Energy and Consumers consider all relevant factors in making these assessments.\nAccounting for the Effects of Industry Regulation: Because Consumers has regulated operations, it uses regulatory accounting to recognize the effects of the regulators' decisions on its financial statements. Consumers continually assesses whether future recovery of its regulatory assets is probable by considering communications and experience with its regulators and changes in the regulatory environment. If Consumers determined that recovery of a regulatory asset were not probable, Consumers would be required to write off the asset and immediately recognize the expense in earnings.\nContingencies: CMS Energy and Consumers make judgments regarding the future outcome of various matters that give rise to contingent liabilities. For such matters, they record liabilities when they are considered probable and reasonably estimable, based on all available information. In particular, CMS Energy and Consumers are participating in various environmental remediation projects for which they have recorded liabilities. The recorded amounts represent estimates that may take into account such considerations as the number of sites, the anticipated scope, cost, and timing of remediation work, the available technology, applicable regulations, and the requirements of governmental authorities. For remediation projects in which the timing of estimated expenditures is considered reliably determinable, CMS Energy and Consumers record the liability at its net present value, using a discount rate equal to the interest rate on monetary assets that are essentially risk-free and have maturities comparable to that of the environmental liability. The amount recorded for any contingency may differ from actual costs incurred when the contingency is resolved. For additional details, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 4, Contingencies and Commitments.\nDerivative Instruments: CMS Energy and Consumers account for certain contracts as derivative instruments. If a contract is a derivative and does not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception, it is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value. Each quarter, the resulting asset or liability is adjusted to reflect any change in the fair value of the contract.\nThe criteria used to determine if an instrument qualifies for derivative accounting or for an exception from derivative accounting are complex and often require judgment in application. Changes in business strategies or market conditions, as well as a requirement to apply different interpretations of the derivative accounting literature, could result in changes in accounting for a single contract or groups of contracts, which could have a material impact on CMS Energy's and Consumers' financial statements. For additional details on CMS Energy's and Consumers' derivatives and how the fair values of derivatives are determined, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 6, Fair Value Measurements.\nIncome Taxes: The amount of income taxes paid by CMS Energy is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, which can result in proposed assessments. An estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. CMS Energy believes adequate reserves have been provided for these exposures; however, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. Additionally, CMS Energy's judgment as to the ability to recover its deferred tax assets may change. CMS Energy believes the valuation allowances related to its deferred tax assets are adequate, but future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments. As a result, CMS Energy's effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly over time. For additional details, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 14, Income Taxes.\nPension and OPEB: CMS Energy and Consumers provide retirement pension benefits to certain employees under non-contributory DB Pension Plans, and they provide postretirement health and life benefits to qualifying retired employees under an OPEB Plan.\nCMS Energy and Consumers record liabilities for pension and OPEB on their consolidated balance sheets at the present value of the future obligations, net of any plan assets. The calculation of the liabilities and associated expenses requires the expertise of actuaries, and requires many assumptions, including:\n\u00b7 life expectancies\n\u00b7 discount rates\n\u00b7 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets\n\u00b7 rate of compensation increases\n\u00b7 expected health care costs\nA change in these assumptions could change significantly CMS Energy's and Consumers' recorded liabilities and associated expenses.\nIn November 2017, CMS Energy and Consumers approved certain amendments to the OPEB Plan. Under these amendments, effective January 1, 2019, certain Medicare-eligible retirees will purchase health care plans from private Medicare exchanges. CMS Energy and Consumers performed a remeasurement of the OPEB Plan as of October 31, 2017, resulting in a $439 million reduction in the benefit obligation at CMS Energy and a $433 million reduction at Consumers.\nEffective December 31, 2017, CMS Energy's and Consumers' then-existing defined benefit pension plan was amended to include only the retired and former employees already covered; this amended plan is referred to as DB Pension Plan B. Also effective December 31, 2017, active employees covered under the defined benefit pension plan were moved to a newly created pension plan, referred to as DB Pension Plan A, whose benefits mirror those provided under DB Pension Plan B. Maintaining separate plans for the two groups will allow CMS Energy and Consumers to employ a more targeted investment strategy and will provide additional opportunities to mitigate risk and volatility.\nPresented in the following table are estimates of costs and cash contributions through 2020 for the DB Pension Plans and OPEB Plan. Actual future costs and contributions will depend on future investment performance, discount rates, and various factors related to the participants of the DB Pension Plans and OPEB Plan. CMS Energy and Consumers will, at a minimum, contribute to the plans as needed to comply with federal funding requirements.\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> In Millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> DB Pension Plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> OPEB Plan\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Contribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Credit1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Contribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CMS Energy, including Consumers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (96\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (99\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (95\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumers2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (90\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (93\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (88\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 As a result of the amendments made to the OPEB Plan, the estimate of OPEB Plan credits increased by $50 million for 2018, 2019, and 2020.\n2 Consumers' pension and OPEB costs are recoverable through its general ratemaking process.\nLowering the expected long-term rate of return on the assets of the DB Pension Plans by 25 basis points would increase estimated pension cost for 2018 by $5 million for both CMS Energy and Consumers. Lowering the PBO discount rates by 25 basis points would increase estimated pension cost for 2018 by $4 million for both CMS Energy and Consumers.\nPension and OPEB plan assets are accounted for and disclosed at fair value. Fair value measurements incorporate assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Development of these assumptions may require judgment.\nFor additional details on postretirement benefits, including the fair value measurements for the assets of the DB Pension Plans and OPEB Plan, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 12, Retirement Benefits.\nRevenue Subject to Refund: The 2016 Energy Law, which became effective in April 2017, eliminated utilities' self-implementation of rates under general rate cases. Consumers filed an electric rate case in March 2017, prior to the effective date of that law, and as result was allowed to self-implement new energy rates in October 2017, subject to refund with interest and potential penalties. Consumers recognized revenue associated with self-implemented rates, but recorded a provision for revenue subject to refund because it considered it probable that it would be required to refund a portion of its self-implemented rates. If a final rate order differed materially from Consumers' estimates underlying its self-implemented rates, it could give rise to accounting adjustments.\nUnbilled Revenues: Consumers' customers are billed monthly in cycles having billing dates that do not generally coincide with the end of a calendar month. This results in customers having received electricity or gas that they have not been billed for as of the month-end. Consumers estimates its unbilled revenues by applying an average billed rate to total unbilled deliveries for each customer class. For additional information on unbilled revenues, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies-Accounts Receivable.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nFor details regarding new accounting standards issued but not yet effective, see Item 8.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is a combined report of CMS Energy and Consumers.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nCMS Energy is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and CMS Enterprises, primarily a domestic independent power producer. Consumers' electric utility operations include the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity, and Consumers' gas utility operations include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas. Consumers' customer base consists of a mix of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers. CMS Enterprises, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, is engaged in domestic independent power production, the marketing of independent power production, and the development of renewable generation.\nCMS Energy and Consumers manage their businesses by the nature of services each provides. CMS Energy operates principally in three business segments: electric utility; gas utility; and enterprises, its non-utility operations and investments. Consumers operates principally in two business segments: electric utility and gas utility. CMS Energy's and Consumers' businesses are affected primarily by:\n\u00b7 regulation and regulatory matters\n\u00b7 state and federal legislation\n\u00b7 economic conditions\n\u00b7 weather\n\u00b7 energy commodity prices\n\u00b7 interest rates\n\u00b7 their securities' credit ratings\nThe Triple Bottom Line\nCMS Energy's and Consumers' purpose is to achieve world class performance while delivering hometown service. In support of this purpose, the companies employ the \u201cConsumers Energy Way,\u201d a lean operating model designed to improve safety, quality, cost, delivery, and employee morale.\nCMS Energy and Consumers measure their progress toward the purpose by considering their impact on the \u201ctriple bottom line\u201d of people, planet, and profit, which is underpinned by performance; this consideration takes into account not only the economic value that the companies create for customers and investors, but also their responsibility to social and environmental goals. The triple bottom line balances the interests of the companies' employees, customers, suppliers, regulators, creditors, Michigan's residents, the investment community, and other stakeholders, and it reflects the broader societal impacts of the companies' activities.\nConsumers' 2017 Sustainability Report, which is available to the public, describes the company's commitment to world class performance and to the triple bottom line and discusses its progress in the areas of safety, environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and economic development.\nPeople: The people element of the triple bottom line represents CMS Energy's and Consumers' commitment to their employees, their customers, the residents of local communities in which the companies do business, and other stakeholders.\nThe safety of employees, customers, and the general public is a priority of CMS Energy and Consumers. Accordingly, CMS Energy and Consumers have worked to integrate a set of safety principles into their business operations and culture. These principles include complying with applicable safety, health, and security regulations and implementing programs and processes aimed at continually improving safety and security conditions. The number of recordable safety incidents in 2017 was 65, compared with 73 in 2016 and 106 in 2015. The number of recordable safety incidents in 2017 was the lowest in Consumers' history, and Consumers is on track to have the best safety results of its EEI peer group, as it did in 2016.\nCMS Energy and Consumers also place a high priority on customer value and on providing a hometown customer experience. Consumers' customer-driven investment program is aimed at improving safety and increasing electric and gas reliability, which has resulted in measureable improvements in customer satisfaction.\nCentral to Consumers' commitment to its customers are the initiatives it has undertaken to keep electricity and natural gas affordable. These initiatives include the adoption of its lean operating model that is focused on completing work safely and correctly the first time, thus minimizing rework and waste, while delivering services on time. Other cost-saving initiatives undertaken by Consumers include:\n\u00b7 replacement of coal-fueled generation with cleaner and more efficient gas-fueled generation, renewable energy, and energy waste reduction and demand response programs\n\u00b7 targeted infrastructure investment, including the installation of smart meters\n\u00b7 information and control system efficiencies\n\u00b7 employee and retiree health care cost sharing\n\u00b7 workforce productivity enhancements\nIn addition, Consumers' gas commodity costs declined by 60 percent from 2007 through 2017, due not only to a decrease in market prices but also to Consumers' improvements to its gas infrastructure and optimization of its gas purchasing and storage strategy. These gas commodity savings are passed on to customers.\nPlanet: The planet element of the triple bottom line represents CMS Energy's and Consumers' commitment to protect the environment; this commitment extends beyond complying with the various state and federal environmental and health and safety laws and regulations to which CMS Energy and Consumers are subject. Consideration of climate change risk and other environmental risks is embedded in the companies' strategy, business planning, and enterprise risk management processes.\nCMS Energy and Consumers continue to focus on opportunities to reduce their carbon footprint by replacing coal-fueled generation with gas-fueled generation and renewable energy. In 2016, Consumers retired seven of its coal-fueled electric generating units, representing 33 percent of its owned coal-fueled generating capacity. As a result of these retirements and other actions taken by CMS Energy and Consumers, the companies' combined percentage of electric supply (self-generated and purchased) from coal has decreased by 16 percentage points since 2015.\nAdditionally, over the last 20 years, Consumers has reduced its sulfur dioxide emissions by 80 percent, its nitrogen oxide emissions by 90 percent, and its particulate matter emissions by 80 percent. Over the last ten years, Consumers has reduced its mercury emissions by 70 percent.\nGoing forward, Consumers will continue to invest in renewable generation and energy waste reduction programs in order to meet the requirements set by the 2016 Energy Law and to fulfill customer demand beyond the renewable energy standard. CMS Energy will continue to pursue further opportunities for the development of renewable generation projects through its non-utility businesses.\nThe 2016 Energy Law aligns with Consumers' clean and lean strategy, which focuses on increasing its generation of renewable energy, helping its customers use less energy, and offering demand response programs to reduce demand during critical peak times. Among other things, the 2016 Energy Law:\n\u00b7 raised the renewable energy standard from the present ten-percent requirement to 12.5 percent by 2019 and 15 percent by 2021\n\u00b7 established a goal of 35 percent combined renewable energy and energy waste reduction by 2025\n\u00b7 authorized incentives for demand response programs and expanded existing incentives for energy efficiency programs, referring to the combined initiatives as energy waste reduction programs\nIn a further effort to advance its environmental stewardship and to meet the requirements of present and future regulations, Consumers has adopted the following voluntary goals for air emissions, water use, and waste reduction:\n\u00b7 Committed to a 20-percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions intensity (pounds of carbon dioxide per MWh generated) by 2025 from a 2008 baseline. In 2016, Consumers achieved a reduction in total tons of carbon dioxide emitted of over 30 percent compared to 2008.\n\u00b7 Committed to a 20-percent reduction in water usage (gallons per MWh generated) by 2020, and surpassed that goal in 2017 with a 35-percent reduction in water used to generate electricity.\n\u00b7 Committed to a cumulative waste reduction goal of one million cubic yards of landfill space avoided by 2019, and met that goal in 2017.\nCMS Energy and Consumers are monitoring numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives, including those to regulate greenhouse gases, and related litigation. They are also monitoring potential changes in policies under the Trump administration. While CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the outcome of these matters, which could have a material effect on the companies, they intend to continue to move forward with their clean energy plan, their carbon reduction goals, and their emphasis on supply diversity.\nProfit: The profit element of the triple bottom line represents CMS Energy's and Consumers' commitment to meeting financial objectives and providing economic development opportunities and benefits in the communities in which they do business. CMS Energy's and Consumers' financial strength allows them to maintain solid investment-grade credit ratings and thereby reduce funding costs for the benefit of customers and investors, to preserve and create jobs, and to reinvest in the communities they serve.\nIn 2017, CMS Energy's net income available to common stockholders was $460 million, and diluted EPS were $1.64. This compares with net income available to common stockholders of $551 million and diluted EPS of $1.98 in 2016. In 2017, benefits from electric and gas rate increases and higher weather-adjusted electric and gas deliveries were more than offset by the impacts of the TCJA and by higher depreciation on increased plant in service. A more detailed discussion of the factors affecting CMS Energy's and Consumers' performance can be found in the Results of Operations section that follows this Executive Overview.\nConsumers projects that its total electric deliveries will remain stable or increase slightly through 2022, and that its gas deliveries will remain stable in 2018 and increase moderately through 2022. This outlook reflects growth in electric demand offset partially by energy waste reduction programs, and growth in gas demand offset partially by energy efficiency and conservation.\nPerformance: Impacting the Triple Bottom Line\nDuring 2017, CMS Energy's and Consumers' commitment to achieving world class performance while delivering hometown service resulted in the companies' best-ever performance in the areas of safety, service, and customer satisfaction. Leveraging the Consumers Energy Way, the companies met record-breaking goals in the areas of:\n\u00b7 lowering recordable safety incidents\n\u00b7 improving customer satisfaction scores\n\u00b7 decreasing the duration of customer outages\n\u00b7 responding faster to customer calls\n\u00b7 achieving on-time delivery commitments\n\u00b7 reading more meters monthly\n\u00b7 improving the accuracy of customer bills\n\u00b7 delivering energy efficiency solutions to customers\nCMS Energy and Consumers will continue to utilize the Consumers Energy Way to enable them to achieve world class performance and positively impact the triple bottom line. Consumers' investment plan and the regulatory environment in which it operates also drive its ability to impact the triple bottom line.\nInvestment Plan: Consumers expects to make significant expenditures on infrastructure upgrades and replacements and electric supply projects from 2018 through 2027. While it has a large number of potential investment opportunities that would add customer value, Consumers has prioritized its spending based on the criteria of enhancing public safety, increasing reliability, maintaining affordability for its customers, and advancing its environmental stewardship. Consumers' investment program is expected to result in annual rate-base growth of six to eight percent. This rate-base growth, together with cost-control initiatives, should allow Consumers to maintain sustainable customer base rate increases (excluding PSCR and GCR charges) at or below the rate of inflation.\nPresented in the following illustration are planned capital expenditures of $10.1 billion that Consumers expects to make from 2018 through 2022:\n\nConsumers plans to spend $8.4 billion over the next five years to maintain and upgrade its gas infrastructure and electric distribution systems in order to enhance reliability, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce energy waste on those systems. The gas infrastructure projects comprise $4.9 billion to sustain deliverability and enhance pipeline integrity and safety. These projects, which involve replacement of mains and services and enhancement of transmission and storage systems, should reduce the minor quantity of methane emissions released as gas is transported. The electric distribution projects comprise $3.5 billion to strengthen circuits and substations and replace poles. Consumers also expects to spend $1.7 billion on electric supply projects, representing new generation, including renewable generation, and environmental investments needed to comply with state and federal laws and regulations.\nRegulation: Regulatory matters are a key aspect of Consumers' business, particularly rate cases and regulatory proceedings before the MPSC, which permit recovery of new investments while helping to ensure that customer rates are fair and affordable. Important regulatory events and developments are summarized below.\n\u00b7 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: In December 2017, President Trump signed the TCJA, which changed existing federal tax law and included numerous provisions that affect businesses. Subsequently, the MPSC ordered all rate-regulated utilities in Michigan to report the impact that the new federal tax law will have on their customers. Consumers filed its response to the MPSC in January 2018, indicating that the TCJA reduces its annual electric revenue requirement by an estimated $116 million, and reduces its annual gas revenue requirement by an estimated $49 million. These amounts exclude potential refunds associated with Consumers' remeasurement of its deferred income taxes, which Consumers has proposed addressing in a future filing. In the January 2018 filing, Consumers recommended that the income tax benefits be provided to customers through a bill credit by the end of 2018. The timing and amortization period of any future rate adjustments or refunds are subject to change based on MPSC orders.\n\u00b7 Electric Rate Case: In March 2017, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $173 million, based on a 10.5 percent authorized return on equity. The filing requested authority to recover new investment in system reliability, environmental compliance, and technology enhancements. In September 2017, Consumers reduced its requested annual rate increase to $148 million. In October 2017, Consumers self-implemented an annual rate increase of $130 million, subject to refund with interest and potential penalties. A final order is expected by the end of March 2018.\n\u00b7 Gas Rate Case: In October 2017, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $178 million, based on a 10.5 percent authorized return on equity. The largest component of the request is an annual revenue requirement of $162 million related to infrastructure investment and related costs that will allow Consumers to improve system safety, capacity, and deliverability.\nThe filing also seeks approval of two rate adjustment mechanisms: a revenue decoupling mechanism and an investment recovery mechanism. The revenue decoupling mechanism would annually reconcile Consumers' actual weather-adjusted nonfuel revenues with the revenues approved by the MPSC. The investment recovery mechanism would provide for additional annual rate increases of $39 million beginning in July 2019 and another $39 million beginning in July 2020 for incremental investments that Consumers plans to make in those years, subject to reconciliation. These future investments are intended to help ensure adequate system capacity and deliverability. The MPSC previously approved an investment recovery mechanism in July 2017 that will be in effect until rates are changed in the pending proceeding.\n\u00b7 State Reliability Mechanism: In November 2017, the MPSC issued an order establishing a state reliability mechanism for Consumers, as directed by the 2016 Energy Law, which required that forward capacity be secured for all electric customers in Michigan, including customers served by alternative electric suppliers under ROA. Under Michigan law, electric customers in Consumers' service territory are allowed to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to ten percent of Consumers' weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year. Under the mechanism approved by the MPSC, beginning June 1, 2018, if an alternative electric supplier does not demonstrate that it has procured its capacity requirements for the four-year forward period, its customers will pay a set charge to the utility for capacity that is not provided by the alternative electric supplier.\nLooking Forward\nCMS Energy and Consumers will continue to consider the impact on the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit in their daily operations as well as in their long-term strategic decisions. Consumers will continue to seek fair and timely regulatory treatment that will support its customer-driven investment plan, while pursuing cost-control initiatives that will allow it to maintain sustainable customer base rates. The Consumers Energy Way is an important means of realizing CMS Energy's and Consumers' purpose of achieving world class performance while delivering hometown service.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCMS Energy Consolidated Results of Operations\n\n\nPresented in the following table are specific after-tax changes to net income available to common stockholders:\n\n1 CMS Energy and Consumers have reclassified certain prior-period amounts to conform to the presentation in the current period.\nConsumers Electric Utility Results of Operations\n\nFollowing is a discussion of significant changes to net income available to common stockholders for 2017 versus 2016 and for 2016 versus 2015.\nElectric Deliveries and Rate Increases: For 2017, electric delivery revenues increased $55 million compared with 2016. This change reflected $82 million from a March 2017 rate increase and from an October 2017 self-implemented rate increase. Also contributing to the change were $13 million in higher revenues associated with the energy waste reduction program and a $10 million increase in the financial incentive associated with energy waste reduction performance standards. These increases were offset partially by a $45 million decrease in sales due primarily to mild weather and a $5 million reduction in other revenues. Deliveries to end-use customers were 37.4 billion kWh in 2017 and 37.9 billion kWh in 2016.\nFor 2016, electric delivery revenues increased $122 million compared with 2015. This change reflected $91 million from a December 2015 rate increase and from a September 2016 self-implemented rate increase, and a $62 million increase in sales due primarily to favorable weather. These increases were offset partially by a $25 million net decrease in securitization revenue, reflecting the conclusion in October 2015 of Consumers' 2001 securitization program, and a $6 million decrease in other revenues. Deliveries to end-use customers were 37.9 billion kWh in 2016 and 37.3 billion kWh in 2015.\nMaintenance and Other Operating Expenses: For 2017, maintenance and other operating expenses increased $7 million compared with 2016. This change reflected increases of $15 million in service restoration costs following severe storms, $13 million in energy waste reduction program costs, $8 million in information technology expenses, $6 million in demand response program costs, and $3 million in other operating and maintenance expenses. Also contributing to the change was the absence, in 2017, of a $4 million benefit associated with a Michigan use tax settlement in 2016. These increases were offset partially by $19 million in lower costs at Consumers' coal-fueled electric generating plants, due in part to the retirement of seven electric generating units in April 2016. Also contributing to the change were a $10 million reduction in postretirement benefit costs, a $7 million reduction in meter reading expense reflecting the implementation of smart meters, and an absence in 2017 of a $6 million charge associated with a 2016 voluntary separation program.\nFor 2016, maintenance and other operating expenses decreased $5 million compared with 2015. This change reflected a $27 million reduction in expenses at the seven coal-fueled electric generating units that Consumers retired in April 2016. Also contributing to the change were a $13 million reduction in uncollectible accounts expense due primarily to the successful implementation of new collection practices and a $4 million benefit associated with a Michigan use tax settlement. These decreases were offset partially by increases of $14 million in forestry expenses, $9 million of expenses related to the Jackson plant acquired in December 2015, an $8 million increase in postretirement benefit costs, a $6 million charge associated with a 2016 voluntary separation program, and a $2 million increase in other operating and maintenance expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization: For 2017, depreciation and amortization expense increased $51 million compared with 2016, due primarily to increased plant in service.\nFor 2016, depreciation and amortization expense increased $36 million compared with 2015. This change reflected a $94 million increase in depreciation expense related to increased plant in service and an increase in depreciation rates that became effective in December 2015, offset partially by a $58 million decrease in amortization of securitized assets, reflecting the conclusion in October 2015 of Consumers' 2001 securitization program.\nGeneral Taxes: For 2017, general taxes decreased $6 million compared with 2016. This change was due to a $10 million benefit from the settlement of a property tax appeal related to Consumers' Zeeland plant, offset partially by a $4 million increase in property taxes, reflecting higher capital spending.\nFor 2016, general taxes increased $15 million compared with 2015. This change was due primarily to increased property taxes, reflecting higher capital spending, and the absence, in 2016, of a benefit associated with a Michigan use tax settlement reached in 2015.\nOther Income, Net of Expenses: For 2017, other income, net of expenses, decreased $4 million compared with 2016. This change was due to a $15 million reduction in nonoperating retirement benefits credits, offset partially by the $6 million impact of benefit plan changes. Also contributing to the change was a $10 million increase in donations in 2017. These changes were offset partially by a $9 million gain on the donation of CMS Energy stock by Consumers, which was eliminated on CMS Energy's consolidated statements of income, and a $6 million increase in other income, net of expenses.\nFor 2016, other income, net of expenses, decreased $11 million compared with 2015. This change was due primarily to a $30 million increase in donations and a $2 million increase in other expenses. This change also reflected the absence, in 2016, of a $6 million benefit related to a Michigan use tax settlement reached in 2015, and a $6 million gain on a donation of CMS Energy stock by Consumers. The gain was eliminated on CMS Energy's consolidated statements of income. These changes were offset partially by a $33 million increase in nonoperating retirement benefits credits, attributable primarily to a change in the discount-rate methodology used to calculate postretirement benefit costs.\nInterest Charges: For 2017, interest charges increased $6 million compared with 2016, reflecting $2 million in higher PSCR interest expenses and a $4 million increase in other interest charges.\nFor 2016, interest charges increased $19 million compared with 2015. This change was due to the absence, in 2016, of a $12 million benefit associated with a Michigan use tax settlement reached in 2015. The change also reflected $7 million attributable primarily to higher average debt levels.\nIncome Taxes: For 2017, income taxes decreased $1 million compared with 2016. This change reflected the $11 million impact of a reduction in Consumers' effective state income tax rate. For additional details on this reduction in Consumers' effective state income tax rate, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 14, Income Taxes. Also contributing to the change were a $10 million decrease associated with lower non-deductible donations, a $3 million reduction due to lower electric utility earnings, and a $2 million decrease in other income taxes. These decreases were offset partially by a $25 million increase to recognize the impacts of the TCJA. For additional details on the TCJA, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 14, Income Taxes.\nFor 2016, income taxes", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is a combined report of CMS Energy and Consumers.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nCMS Energy is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and CMS Enterprises, primarily a domestic independent power producer. Consumers' electric utility operations include the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity, and Consumers' gas utility operations include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas. Consumers' customer base consists of a mix of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers. CMS Enterprises, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, is engaged in domestic independent power production, the marketing of independent power production, and the development of renewable generation.\nCMS Energy and Consumers manage their businesses by the nature of services each provides. CMS Energy operates principally in three business segments: electric utility; gas utility; and enterprises, its non-utility operations and investments. Consumers operates principally in two business segments: electric utility and gas utility. CMS Energy's and Consumers' businesses are affected primarily by:\n\u00b7 regulation and regulatory matters\n\u00b7 state and federal legislation\n\u00b7 economic conditions\n\u00b7 weather\n\u00b7 energy commodity prices\n\u00b7 interest rates\n\u00b7 their securities' credit ratings\nThe Triple Bottom Line\nCMS Energy's and Consumers' purpose is to achieve world class performance while delivering hometown service. In support of this purpose, the companies employ the \u201cConsumers Energy Way,\u201d a lean operating model designed to improve safety, quality, cost, delivery, and employee morale.\nCMS Energy and Consumers measure their progress toward the purpose by considering their impact on the \u201ctriple bottom line\u201d of people, planet, and profit, which is underpinned by performance; this consideration takes into account not only the economic value that the companies create for customers and investors, but also their responsibility to social and environmental goals. The triple bottom line balances the interests of the companies' employees, customers, suppliers, regulators, creditors, Michigan's residents, the investment community, and other stakeholders, and it reflects the broader societal impacts of the companies' activities.\nConsumers' 2017 Sustainability Report, which is available to the public, describes the company's commitment to world class performance and to the triple bottom line and discusses its progress in the areas of safety, environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and economic development.\nPeople: The people element of the triple bottom line represents CMS Energy's and Consumers' commitment to their employees, their customers, the residents of local communities in which the companies do business, and other stakeholders.\nThe safety of employees, customers, and the general public is a priority of CMS Energy and Consumers. Accordingly, CMS Energy and Consumers have worked to integrate a set of safety principles into their business operations and culture. These principles include complying with applicable safety, health, and security regulations and implementing programs and processes aimed at continually improving safety and security conditions. The number of recordable safety incidents in 2017 was 65, compared with 73 in 2016 and 106 in 2015. The number of recordable safety incidents in 2017 was the lowest in Consumers' history, and Consumers is on track to have the best safety results of its EEI peer group, as it did in 2016.\nCMS Energy and Consumers also place a high priority on customer value and on providing a hometown customer experience. Consumers' customer-driven investment program is aimed at improving safety and increasing electric and gas reliability, which has resulted in measureable improvements in customer satisfaction.\nCentral to Consumers' commitment to its customers are the initiatives it has undertaken to keep electricity and natural gas affordable. These initiatives include the adoption of its lean operating model that is focused on completing work safely and correctly the first time, thus minimizing rework and waste, while delivering services on time. Other cost-saving initiatives undertaken by Consumers include:\n\u00b7 replacement of coal-fueled generation with cleaner and more efficient gas-fueled generation, renewable energy, and energy waste reduction and demand response programs\n\u00b7 targeted infrastructure investment, including the installation of smart meters\n\u00b7 information and control system efficiencies\n\u00b7 employee and retiree health care cost sharing\n\u00b7 workforce productivity enhancements\nIn addition, Consumers' gas commodity costs declined by 60 percent from 2007 through 2017, due not only to a decrease in market prices but also to Consumers' improvements to its gas infrastructure and optimization of its gas purchasing and storage strategy. These gas commodity savings are passed on to customers.\nPlanet: The planet element of the triple bottom line represents CMS Energy's and Consumers' commitment to protect the environment; this commitment extends beyond complying with the various state and federal environmental and health and safety laws and regulations to which CMS Energy and Consumers are subject. Consideration of climate change risk and other environmental risks is embedded in the companies' strategy, business planning, and enterprise risk management processes.\nCMS Energy and Consumers continue to focus on opportunities to reduce their carbon footprint by replacing coal-fueled generation with gas-fueled generation and renewable energy. In 2016, Consumers retired seven of its coal-fueled electric generating units, representing 33 percent of its owned coal-fueled generating capacity. As a result of these retirements and other actions taken by CMS Energy and Consumers, the companies' combined percentage of electric supply (self-generated and purchased) from coal has decreased by 16 percentage points since 2015.\nAdditionally, over the last 20 years, Consumers has reduced its sulfur dioxide emissions by 80 percent, its nitrogen oxide emissions by 90 percent, and its particulate matter emissions by 80 percent. Over the last ten years, Consumers has reduced its mercury emissions by 70 percent.\nGoing forward, Consumers will continue to invest in renewable generation and energy waste reduction programs in order to meet the requirements set by the 2016 Energy Law and to fulfill customer demand beyond the renewable energy standard. CMS Energy will continue to pursue further opportunities for the development of renewable generation projects through its non-utility businesses.\nThe 2016 Energy Law aligns with Consumers' clean and lean strategy, which focuses on increasing its generation of renewable energy, helping its customers use less energy, and offering demand response programs to reduce demand during critical peak times. Among other things, the 2016 Energy Law:\n\u00b7 raised the renewable energy standard from the present ten-percent requirement to 12.5 percent by 2019 and 15 percent by 2021\n\u00b7 established a goal of 35 percent combined renewable energy and energy waste reduction by 2025\n\u00b7 authorized incentives for demand response programs and expanded existing incentives for energy efficiency programs, referring to the combined initiatives as energy waste reduction programs\nIn a further effort to advance its environmental stewardship and to meet the requirements of present and future regulations, Consumers has adopted the following voluntary goals for air emissions, water use, and waste reduction:\n\u00b7 Committed to a 20-percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions intensity (pounds of carbon dioxide per MWh generated) by 2025 from a 2008 baseline. In 2016, Consumers achieved a reduction in total tons of carbon dioxide emitted of over 30 percent compared to 2008.\n\u00b7 Committed to a 20-percent reduction in water usage (gallons per MWh generated) by 2020, and surpassed that goal in 2017 with a 35-percent reduction in water used to generate electricity.\n\u00b7 Committed to a cumulative waste reduction goal of one million cubic yards of landfill space avoided by 2019, and met that goal in 2017.\nCMS Energy and Consumers are monitoring numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives, including those to regulate greenhouse gases, and related litigation. They are also monitoring potential changes in policies under the Trump administration. While CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the outcome of these matters, which could have a material effect on the companies, they intend to continue to move forward with their clean energy plan, their carbon reduction goals, and their emphasis on supply diversity.\nProfit: The profit element of the triple bottom line represents CMS Energy's and Consumers' commitment to meeting financial objectives and providing economic development opportunities and benefits in the communities in which they do business. CMS Energy's and Consumers' financial strength allows them to maintain solid investment-grade credit ratings and thereby reduce funding costs for the benefit of customers and investors, to preserve and create jobs, and to reinvest in the communities they serve.\nIn 2017, CMS Energy's net income available to common stockholders was $460 million, and diluted EPS were $1.64. This compares with net income available to common stockholders of $551 million and diluted EPS of $1.98 in 2016. In 2017, benefits from electric and gas rate increases and higher weather-adjusted electric and gas deliveries were more than offset by the impacts of the TCJA and by higher depreciation on increased plant in service. A more detailed discussion of the factors affecting CMS Energy's and Consumers' performance can be found in the Results of Operations section that follows this Executive Overview.\nConsumers projects that its total electric deliveries will remain stable or increase slightly through 2022, and that its gas deliveries will remain stable in 2018 and increase moderately through 2022. This outlook reflects growth in electric demand offset partially by energy waste reduction programs, and growth in gas demand offset partially by energy efficiency and conservation.\nPerformance: Impacting the Triple Bottom Line\nDuring 2017, CMS Energy's and Consumers' commitment to achieving world class performance while delivering hometown service resulted in the companies' best-ever performance in the areas of safety, service, and customer satisfaction. Leveraging the Consumers Energy Way, the companies met record-breaking goals in the areas of:\n\u00b7 lowering recordable safety incidents\n\u00b7 improving customer satisfaction scores\n\u00b7 decreasing the duration of customer outages\n\u00b7 responding faster to customer calls\n\u00b7 achieving on-time delivery commitments\n\u00b7 reading more meters monthly\n\u00b7 improving the accuracy of customer bills\n\u00b7 delivering energy efficiency solutions to customers\nCMS Energy and Consumers will continue to utilize the Consumers Energy Way to enable them to achieve world class performance and positively impact the triple bottom line. Consumers' investment plan and the regulatory environment in which it operates also drive its ability to impact the triple bottom line.\nInvestment Plan: Consumers expects to make significant expenditures on infrastructure upgrades and replacements and electric supply projects from 2018 through 2027. While it has a large number of potential investment opportunities that would add customer value, Consumers has prioritized its spending based on the criteria of enhancing public safety, increasing reliability, maintaining affordability for its customers, and advancing its environmental stewardship. Consumers' investment program is expected to result in annual rate-base growth of six to eight percent. This rate-base growth, together with cost-control initiatives, should allow Consumers to maintain sustainable customer base rate increases (excluding PSCR and GCR charges) at or below the rate of inflation.\nPresented in the following illustration are planned capital expenditures of $10.1 billion that Consumers expects to make from 2018 through 2022:\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Gas infrastructure\n($4.9 billion)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Electric distribution\n($3.5 billion)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Electric supply ($1.7 billion)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsumers plans to spend $8.4 billion over the next five years to maintain and upgrade its gas infrastructure and electric distribution systems in order to enhance reliability, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce energy waste on those systems. The gas infrastructure projects comprise $4.9 billion to sustain deliverability and enhance pipeline integrity and safety. These projects, which involve replacement of mains and services and enhancement of transmission and storage systems, should reduce the minor quantity of methane emissions released as gas is transported. The electric distribution projects comprise $3.5 billion to strengthen circuits and substations and replace poles. Consumers also expects to spend $1.7 billion on electric supply projects, representing new generation, including renewable generation, and environmental investments needed to comply with state and federal laws and regulations.\nRegulation: Regulatory matters are a key aspect of Consumers' business, particularly rate cases and regulatory proceedings before the MPSC, which permit recovery of new investments while helping to ensure that customer rates are fair and affordable. Important regulatory events and developments are summarized below.\n\u00b7 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: In December 2017, President Trump signed the TCJA, which changed existing federal tax law and included numerous provisions that affect businesses. Subsequently, the MPSC ordered all rate-regulated utilities in Michigan to report the impact that the new federal tax law will have on their customers. Consumers filed its response to the MPSC in January 2018, indicating that the TCJA reduces its annual electric revenue requirement by an estimated $116 million, and reduces its annual gas revenue requirement by an estimated $49 million. These amounts exclude potential refunds associated with Consumers' remeasurement of its deferred income taxes, which Consumers has proposed addressing in a future filing. In the January 2018 filing, Consumers recommended that the income tax benefits be provided to customers through a bill credit by the end of 2018. The timing and amortization period of any future rate adjustments or refunds are subject to change based on MPSC orders.\n\u00b7 Electric Rate Case: In March 2017, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $173 million, based on a 10.5 percent authorized return on equity. The filing requested authority to recover new investment in system reliability, environmental compliance, and technology enhancements. In September 2017, Consumers reduced its requested annual rate increase to $148 million. In October 2017, Consumers self-implemented an annual rate increase of $130 million, subject to refund with interest and potential penalties. A final order is expected by the end of March 2018.\n\u00b7 Gas Rate Case: In October 2017, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $178 million, based on a 10.5 percent authorized return on equity. The largest component of the request is an annual revenue requirement of $162 million related to infrastructure investment and related costs that will allow Consumers to improve system safety, capacity, and deliverability.\nThe filing also seeks approval of two rate adjustment mechanisms: a revenue decoupling mechanism and an investment recovery mechanism. The revenue decoupling mechanism would annually reconcile Consumers' actual weather-adjusted nonfuel revenues with the revenues approved by the MPSC. The investment recovery mechanism would provide for additional annual rate increases of $39 million beginning in July 2019 and another $39 million beginning in July 2020 for incremental investments that Consumers plans to make in those years, subject to reconciliation. These future investments are intended to help ensure adequate system capacity and deliverability. The MPSC previously approved an investment recovery mechanism in July 2017 that will be in effect until rates are changed in the pending proceeding.\n\u00b7 State Reliability Mechanism: In November 2017, the MPSC issued an order establishing a state reliability mechanism for Consumers, as directed by the 2016 Energy Law, which required that forward capacity be secured for all electric customers in Michigan, including customers served by alternative electric suppliers under ROA. Under Michigan law, electric customers in Consumers' service territory are allowed to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to ten percent of Consumers' weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year. Under the mechanism approved by the MPSC, beginning June 1, 2018, if an alternative electric supplier does not demonstrate that it has procured its capacity requirements for the four-year forward period, its customers will pay a set charge to the utility for capacity that is not provided by the alternative electric supplier.\nLooking Forward\nCMS Energy and Consumers will continue to consider the impact on the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit in their daily operations as well as in their long-term strategic decisions. Consumers will continue to seek fair and timely regulatory treatment that will support its customer-driven investment plan, while pursuing cost-control initiatives that will allow it to maintain sustainable customer base rates. The Consumers Energy Way is an important means of realizing CMS Energy's and Consumers' purpose of achieving world class performance while delivering hometown service.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCMS

common stockholders for 2017 versus 2016 and for 2016 versus 2015.\nElectric Deliveries and Rate Increases: For 2017, electric delivery revenues increased $55 million compared with 2016. This change reflected $82 million from a March 2017 rate increase and from an October 2017 self-implemented rate increase. Also contributing to the change were $13 million in higher revenues associated with the energy waste reduction program and a $10 million increase in the financial incentive associated with energy waste reduction performance standards. These increases were offset partially by a $45 million decrease in sales due primarily to mild weather and a $5 million reduction in other revenues. Deliveries to end-use customers were 37.4 billion kWh in 2017 and 37.9 billion kWh in 2016.\nFor 2016, electric delivery revenues increased $122 million compared with 2015. This change reflected $91 million from a December 2015 rate increase and from a September 2016 self-implemented rate increase, and a $62 million increase in sales due primarily to favorable weather. These increases were offset partially by a $25 million net decrease in securitization revenue, reflecting the conclusion in October 2015 of Consumers' 2001 securitization program, and a $6 million decrease in other revenues. Deliveries to end-use customers were 37.9 billion kWh in 2016 and 37.3 billion kWh in 2015.\nMaintenance and Other Operating Expenses: For 2017, maintenance and other operating expenses increased $7 million compared with 2016. This change reflected increases of $15 million in service restoration costs following severe storms, $13 million in energy waste reduction program costs, $8 million in information technology expenses, $6 million in demand response program costs, and $3 million in other operating and maintenance expenses. Also contributing to the change was the absence, in 2017, of a $4 million benefit associated with a Michigan use tax settlement in 2016. These increases were offset partially by $19 million in lower costs at Consumers' coal-fueled electric generating plants, due in part to the retirement of seven electric generating units in April 2016. Also contributing to the change were a $10 million reduction in postretirement benefit costs, a $7 million reduction in meter reading expense reflecting the implementation of smart meters, and an absence in 2017 of a $6 million charge associated with a 2016 voluntary separation program.\nFor 2016, maintenance and other operating expenses decreased $5 million compared with 2015. This change reflected a $27 million reduction in expenses at the seven coal-fueled electric generating units that Consumers retired in April 2016. Also contributing to the change were a $13 million reduction in uncollectible accounts expense due primarily to the successful implementation of new collection practices and a $4 million benefit associated with a Michigan use tax settlement. These decreases were offset partially by increases of $14 million in forestry expenses, $9 million of expenses related to the Jackson plant acquired in December 2015, an $8 million increase in postretirement benefit costs, a $6 million charge associated with a 2016 voluntary separation program, and a $2 million increase in other operating and maintenance expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization: For 2017, depreciation and amortization expense increased $51 million compared with 2016, due primarily to increased plant in service.\nFor 2016, depreciation and amortization expense increased $36 million compared with 2015. This change reflected a $94 million increase in depreciation expense related to increased plant in service and an increase in depreciation rates that became effective in December 2015, offset partially by a $58 million decrease in amortization of securitized assets, reflecting the conclusion in October 2015 of Consumers' 2001 securitization program.\nGeneral Taxes: For 2017, general taxes decreased $6 million compared with 2016. This change was due to a $10 million benefit from the settlement of a property tax appeal related to Consumers' Zeeland plant, offset partially by a $4 million increase in property taxes, reflecting higher capital spending.\nFor 2016, general taxes increased $15 million compared with 2015. This change was due primarily to increased property taxes, reflecting higher capital spending, and the absence, in 2016, of a benefit associated with a Michigan use tax settlement reached in 2015.\nOther Income, Net of Expenses: For 2017, other income, net of expenses, decreased $4 million compared with 2016. This change was due to a $15 million reduction in nonoperating retirement benefits credits, offset partially by the $6 million impact of benefit plan changes. Also contributing to the change was a $10 million increase in donations in 2017. These changes were offset partially by a $9 million gain on the donation of CMS Energy stock by Consumers, which was eliminated on CMS Energy's consolidated statements of income, and a $6 million increase in other income, net of expenses.\nFor 2016, other income, net of expenses, decreased $11 million compared with 2015. This change was due primarily to a $30 million increase in donations and a $2 million increase in other expenses. This change also reflected the absence, in 2016, of a $6 million benefit related to a Michigan use tax settlement reached in 2015, and a $6 million gain on a donation of CMS Energy stock by Consumers. The gain was eliminated on CMS Energy's consolidated statements of income. These changes were offset partially by a $33 million increase in nonoperating retirement benefits credits, attributable primarily to a change in the discount-rate methodology used to calculate postretirement benefit costs.\nInterest Charges: For 2017, interest charges increased $6 million compared with 2016, reflecting $2 million in higher PSCR interest expenses and a $4 million increase in other interest charges.\nFor 2016, interest charges increased $19 million compared with 2015. This change was due to the absence, in 2016, of a $12 million benefit associated with a Michigan use tax settlement reached in 2015. The change also reflected $7 million attributable primarily to higher average debt levels.\nIncome Taxes: For 2017, income taxes decreased $1 million compared with 2016. This change reflected the $11 million impact of a reduction in Consumers' effective state income tax rate. For additional details on this reduction in Consumers' effective state income tax rate, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 14, Income Taxes. Also contributing to the change were a $10 million decrease associated with lower non-deductible donations, a $3 million reduction due to lower electric utility earnings, and a $2 million decrease in other income taxes. These decreases were offset partially by a $25 million increase to recognize the impacts of the TCJA. For additional details on the TCJA, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 14, Income Taxes.\nFor 2016, income taxes"}
