Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nResults of Operations\nGeneral\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities based upon accounting policies management has implemented. The Company has identified the policies and estimates below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the Company's business operations are discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, where such policies affect its reported financial results. The actual impact of these factors may differ under different assumptions or conditions.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nDuring the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, the aviation and travel industries, which are served by the Company and its products, were severely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Travel restrictions and other measures imposed by most jurisdictions, coupled with the public's reluctance to travel during this time, resulted in a precipitous decline in demand for air travel, and our customers in the aviation and travel industries drastically reduced their capacity and operations from 2020 into 2021 as compared to 2019, which in turn has resulted in a significant reduction of demand for our products and services. As a result, the Company has faced increased economic pressures and experienced a significant loss of revenue during the two-year period ended October 31, 2021. The Company anticipates a return to an improved economic environment in fiscal 2022 given the state of vaccinations, treatments available, and changes in public behaviors. The recovery, however, depends on many factors, the outcomes of which are uncertain or unknown at this time, such as, among other things, the scope, severity and duration of any variants to the COVID-19 virus, the continuing actions to contain the pandemic or to mitigate its impact, the acceptance and public distribution of treatments and vaccines for the disease (including its variants), and the length of time before the public feels safe to travel. All of these variables will impact how quickly the industry can recover and may affect the revenue and earnings levels of the Company. See Risk Factors\u201d.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d), enacted in March 2020, as well as subsequently enacted legislation, including the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the Rescue Act\u201d), have provided economic support for, among others, businesses in the airline industry. The Company has received grants under both the CARES Act and the Rescue Act (collectively referred to herein as CARES Act grants\u201d), totaling approximately $6,498,000, as described in more detail below.\n1.In July 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury to receive an aggregate of $3,003,000 in emergency relief through the CARES Act Payroll Support Program ( PSP1\u201d). The relief payments were received in three installments from July 2020 through September 2020. Pursuant to the Payroll Support Program Agreement, the relief payments must be used exclusively for the continuation of payment of certain employee wages, salaries and benefits. The Company has used such relief payments for such purpose. The Payroll Support Program Agreement provides that the relief payments are conditioned on the Company's agreement to, among other things, refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs through September 30, 2020, as well as other conditions including prohibitions on share repurchases and dividends through September 30, 2021, and certain limitations on executive compensation.\n2.On February 12, 2021, the Company received an additional top off\u201d disbursement of $875,000 under PSP1, subject to the terms and conditions described above.\n3.On March 5, 2021, the Company entered into a Payroll Support Program Extension Agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury for an award the Company received under the CARES Act Payroll Support Program ( PSP2\u201d). The total amount awarded to the Company under PSP2 was approximately $1,310,000. The relief payments under PSP2 were received in two installments of approximately $655,000 each on March 8, 2021 and April 26, 2021. As with the original grant under PSP1, PSP2 proceeds are to be used exclusively for the continuation of payment of certain employee wages, salaries, and benefits. The Company has used such relief payments for such purpose. The Payroll Support Program Extension Agreement for PSP2 provides that the relief payments are conditioned on the Company's agreement to, among other things, refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs through the later of March 31, 2021, or the date on which the Company has expended all of the payroll support, as well as other conditions including prohibitions on share repurchases and dividends through March 31, 2022, and certain limitations on executive compensation.\n4.On April 16, 2021, the Company entered into a Payroll Support Program 3 Agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury for an award the Company received under the Rescue Act (PSP3\u201d). The total amount awarded to the Company under PSP3 was approximately $1,310,000. The first installment, in the amount of approximately $655,000, was received by the Company on April 29, 2021. The second installment of approximately $655,000 was received by the Company on May 27, 2021. The Company does not anticipate any additional stimulus grant payments under the Payroll Support Programs. As with the original\ngrants under PSP1 and PSP2, proceeds under PSP3 are to be used exclusively for the continuation of payment of certain employee wages, salaries, and benefits. The Company has used such proceeds for such purpose. The Payroll Support Program 3 Agreement provides that the relief payments are conditioned on the Company's agreement to, among other things, refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs through the later of September 30, 2021, or the date on which the Company has expended all of the payroll support under PSP3, as well as other conditions including prohibitions on share repurchases and dividends through September 30, 2022, and certain limitations on executive compensation. The amount of unused stimulus funding as of October 31 2021 and 2020 was $856,000 and $1,934,000 (exclusive of $3,495,000 in grants received after October 31, 2020), respectively, and is shown in the balance sheet under current liabilities as Accrued Liabilities - Stimulus Funding.\nThe Company believes that it has operated in compliance with all the provisions and requirements under the CARES Act and the Rescue Act during the two-year period ended October 31, 2021 and fully intends to continue to comply with all such provisions and requirements. Consequently, the Company has accounted for the advanced funds as grants not requiring repayment and recognized such amounts in income as qualifying salaries, wages and benefits have been incurred. During the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company reduced its compensation expense by $4,578,000 and $1,130,000, respectively, as the CARES Act grant proceeds received by the Company were used to fund eligible payroll costs. If the Company does not comply with the provisions of the CARES Act, the Rescue Act and the Payroll Support Program Agreements, the Company may be required to repay the government funds and also be subject to other remedies.\nAdditionally, provisions under the CARES Act allow the Company to defer payment of the employer's share of social security taxes incurred from March of 2020 through December 31, 2020. The amount of payroll taxes subject to deferred payment is approximately $139,000. Under the terms of the legislation, 50% of the deferred payroll taxes were due and paid by December 31, 2021, and the remaining 50% are due and payable by December 31, 2022.\nThe Company has taken several actions beginning in April 2020 and prior to receiving CARES Act funds, to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business, as outlined below:\n\u00b7Eliminated or furloughed approximately one-third of then-existing positions (all furloughed employees were offered an opportunity to return, subsequent to the Company receiving the CARES Act funds);\n\u00b7Instituted a temporary pay reduction plan affecting essentially all of the then-remaining employees;\n\u00b7Reduced the use of outside consultants;\n\u00b7Decommissioned the PASSUR Network to reduce data feed and telecom costs; and\n\u00b7Reduced and/or eliminated other operating expenses that were not critical to the short-term outlook of the Company.\nThe effects of the actions above were reflected in lower costs of revenues, research and development and administrative costs in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, compared to fiscal 2019, and the Company anticipates that such cost savings will continue into fiscal 2022. However, if the recovery of the air transportation industry accelerates and revenue levels quickly return to pre-COVID-19 levels, these levels of cost savings may not be practicable or sustainable to support the operations necessary for the increased level of revenue. See Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nPASSUR is a global leader in digital operational excellence. The Company's trusted platform, combined with professional services, helps customers reduce operational complexity and lower operating expenses.\nOperational efficiency is more important now than ever to eliminate sources of waste, variability, and inflexibility in operations. The Company addresses these significant industry problems by using our technology platform, combined with professional services, to provide solutions that predict, prioritize, prevent and help the industry recover from unexpected disruptions. These disruptions have long been seen as the cost of doing business in the industry and are even more pronounced today and create greater uncertainty to the industry. The Company provides actionable intelligence to enable the industry to manage their operations more efficiently and increase profits.\nThe Company provides its solutions to airlines and airports in the U.S., as well as an airline in Latin America. The global market presents an opportunity to network more customers in a broader market.\nOur core business addresses some of the aviation industry's most intractable and costly challenges, including, but not limited to, underutilization of airspace and airport capacity, delays, cancellations, and diversions. Several independent studies have estimated the annual direct costs of such inefficiencies to airlines in the United States at over $8 billion annually and worldwide direct cost at over $30 billion annually.\nSolutions offered by PASSUR help to ensure flight completion. They cover the entire flight life cycle, from gate to gate, and result in reductions in overall costs and carbon emissions, while maximizing revenue opportunities, improving operational efficiency, and enhancing the passenger experience.\nThe Company's revenues are generated by selling: (1) subscription-based real-time decision and information solutions; and (2) professional services.\nThe Company's major achievements during fiscal year 2021 are summarized below:\nDespite the ongoing difficulties that the COVID-19 pandemic presented for the aviation industry, PASSUR was able to secure 19 new contracts with a mix of new customers and existing customers with incremental revenue and renew 42 of 48 contracts, with the six losses directly attributed to reduced flight volumes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2021, PASSUR:\n\u00b7Launched a new data service (ARiVADATA ) in August, 2021, leading to several new customer wins\n\u00b7Continued to enhance the ARiVATM platform, aligned to revenue and market opportunities\n\u00b7Began the process of migrating from our co-location infrastructure to a cloud based, secure, resilient, and scalable platform\n\u00b7Integrated an additional 25,000 terrestrial ADS-B sensors, completed the integration of Aireon satellite surface and in-flight data feeds\n\u00b7Enhanced the value of the ARiVATM platform through improvements in implementation of machine learning capabilities and enhanced algorithms\nKey 2021 Developments\nIntroduction of the ARiVADATA Data Service\nARiVADATA is one of the market leading aviation data solutions, designed to reduce operating costs by providing predictive and real-time insights into complex aviation operations, delivered through an application program interface (API). Some features include:\n\u00b7Global predictive aircraft situational awareness through machine learning\n\u00b7Real time operations control (airborne operations and airfield operations)\n\u00b7Gate-to-gate surface and airborne tracking on a single platform\n\u00b7Compliance with the ICAO GADSS mandate (described below)\n\u00b7Traffic analysis\n\u00b7Statistical reporting\nAs of January 1, 2023, the ICAO GADSS mandate requires aircraft to be continuously tracked anywhere in the globe, including over water, mountains, and other uncontrolled airspace, with a minimum update rate of 15 minutes - switching to updates every one (1) minute under distress conditions.\u201d\nIn 2021, PASSUR was able to create the ARiVA Global Feed (AGF), which fuses over 44 data feeds, including from multiple government, ANSP, and commercial surveillance sources. AGF consolidates in one feed all of the data required by operators and aviation software support companies to maintain GADSS aircraft tracking compliance.\nNew Customer Wins and Renewals\nDuring 2021, despite the ongoing difficulties that the COVID-19 pandemic presented for the aviation industry, in a testament to our ability to meet customer needs and continue to assist them in achieving meaningful operational savings, PASSUR was able to secure 19 new contract wins, through a mix of new customers and existing customers with incremental revenue, on our new ARiVATM platform, while at the same time renewing and migrating 42 customer contracts, from our legacy services to the ARiVATM platform. New wins and renewals crossed all customer segments, including Airports, Airlines as well as FBOs.\nExpansion of the PASSUR Partnership Footprint\nPASSUR has now taken what we believe to be a market leading position in terms of our global ADS-B coverage through the addition of the AirNav Systems ADS-B network into our satellite and existing extensive terrestrial ADS-B coverage.\nMigration of the ARiVATM Platform to Cloud-Based Computing\nIn 2020, PASSUR took the opportunity to migrate away from a hardware-based data collection platform and become an aggregator of global data. In 2021, PASSUR started a similar journey to migrate from our legacy, hardware-based co-location infrastructure platform, to a cloud-based platform. Starting with development instances, the Company believes that it is poised to successfully transition all of our key products to the cloud by the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. We believe this will aid PASSUR in achieving greater security, resiliency, and cost performance, in addition to positioning us for scalable growth moving forward.\nSetting the Stage for Global Expansion\nIn the past, PASSUR revenue growth was challenged due to dependencies on its proprietary hardware network, deployed at specific locations, mainly within the continental United States. Over the last 18 months, PASSUR has gone through a major evolution to become a next-generation SaaS company and has focused on sourcing and aggregating global data feeds (satellite as well as terrestrial), as well as additional data or information required to enhance the ARiVATM platform's effectiveness. As part of this evolution, PASSUR substantially enhanced our platform capabilities to enable new and existing services to be delivered across all customer segments on a global basis. These enhancements include improvements to our artificial intelligence/machine learning engine, visualization, alerting, and collaborative decision-making capabilities.\nBy delivering these enhancements in 2021, PASSUR believes, subject to the factors described under Risk Factors\u201d, that it is now optimally positioned to service all stakeholders within the aviation industry on a global basis.\nPASSUR Network\nCertain of PASSUR's services traditionally relied on our proprietary network of sensors for aircraft surveillance - the PASSUR and Surface Multilateration ( SMLAT\u201d) Network Systems (both collectively, the PASSUR Network\u201d). During the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, in light of the FAA's mandate for ADS-B equipage on aircrafts operating in most U.S. airspace, effective January 2020, and parallel adoption of ADS-B requirements in much of the world, the Company performed a comprehensive review of its data feeds, specifically those associated with the PASSUR Network units, and external ADS-B data feeds to determine if these external data feeds provide sufficient redundant data as to that generated from the existing PASSUR installations. The Company determined that such services could be powered by a combination of FAA data plus commercial ADS-B aggregator feeds and other data feeds available to the Company, which would provide a more cost-effective solution and allow us to focus more on value-added analytics, and less on sensor technology. In this regard, the Company reviewed and decommissioned approximately half of its PASSUR Network system assets during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. As a result, during the year ended October 31, 2020, the Company wrote off the total remaining carrying value applicable to the PASSUR Network systems of approximately $3,565,000, and lease assets applicable to these PASSUR locations of approximately $175,000 during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, which amounts were included as an impairment charge for the year ended October 31, 2020. The write-off amount included PASSUR System and SMLAT System assets as well as inventory of finished and spare parts. The Company essentially completed the decommissioning process during fiscal year 2021.\nRevenues\nManagement concentrates its efforts on the sale of business intelligence, predictive analytics, and decision support product applications, utilizing data primarily derived from external sources and, to a lesser extent, the PASSUR Network (which is currently in the process of being decommissioned, as described above). Such efforts include the continued development of existing products, new product offerings and to a lesser extent, professional services.\nThe Company is a supplier and partner to the air transportation industry. Many of the Company's customers have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak and the rapid decline in air travel. As a result, the Company experienced downturns in its revenues for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, as compared to revenues for fiscal year 2019. See Risk Factors.\u201d\nAlthough the Company's revenue is primarily subscription based, during fiscal 2020, several customers requested, and the Company agreed to, the suspension of certain services to those customers, or the provision of services free of charge during a specific period of time. Additionally, one customer requested extended terms of payment, which request the Company also accepted. The Company believes that these decisions were in the best interests of the Company as a partner to the aviation industry and will benefit the Company in the longer term. The Company continues to believe that its products and professional service engagements are critical to the efficient operation of the air transportation market.\nIn fiscal year 2021, total revenues decreased $5.4 million, or 47%, to $6,157,000, as compared to $11,529,000 in fiscal year 2020. The decrease in total revenues was primarily due to a decrease in subscription revenue of $5.2 million or 47%, and a decrease in consulting and other revenue of $186,000 to $407,000, as compared to fiscal year 2020.\nThe decrease in subscription revenue of $5.2 million was primarily due to several expiring airline and airport contracts that were not renewed, which were offset in part by new contracts for subscription services closed during fiscal year 2021 and net incremental revenue recognized during both periods in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 related to new contracts closed during fiscal year 2020.\nThe Company was engaged in ongoing discussions with two of its customers about the possible renewal of certain existing contracts which had expired at various times from January 31, 2020 through May 31, 2020, but certain parts of these contracts had been renewed on a short-term interim basis. These contracts were not renewed in full or in part, which resulted in the loss of potential revenue generated from these contracts of approximately $2,322,000 for fiscal 2020. Additionally, the Company agreed with one of its customers to a temporary suspension of billings during the period from August 1, 2020 through October 31, 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This reduced the Company's fiscal 2020 revenue by approximately $513,000.\nThe decrease in consulting and other revenue of $186,000 to $407,000 for the year ended October 31, 2021, as compared to $593,000 for the same period in 2020, was due to several new professional service agreements entered into in fiscal 2020 that did not recur in fiscal 2021.\nThe Company continues to enhance its wide selection of products by developing and deploying new software applications and solutions to better address customers' needs, all of which are easily deliverable through web-based applications or as stand-alone professional services.\nCost of Revenues\nCosts associated with subscription and maintenance revenues consist primarily of direct labor, amortization of previously capitalized software development costs, communication costs, data feeds, travel and entertainment, and consulting fees. Previously, cost of revenues in each reporting period was impacted by capitalized costs associated with software development and data center projects, costs associated with upgrades to PASSUR and SMLAT Systems necessary to make such systems compatible with new software applications (all referred to as Capitalized Assets\u201d), depreciation of PASSUR and SMLAT Systems as well as the ordinary repair and maintenance of existing PASSUR and SMLAT Systems. Additionally, cost of revenues in each previous reporting period was impacted by the number of PASSUR and SMLAT System units added to the PASSUR Network, which included the production, shipment, and installation of these assets (largely installed by unaffiliated outside contractors), which had previously been capitalized to the PASSUR Network. In this regard, the Company reviewed and decommissioned approximately half of its PASSUR Network system assets during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The total balance attributable to the PASSUR Network was written off as of April 30, 2020, as described in more detail below. The Company essentially completed the decommissioning process during fiscal year 2021. In prior periods, the labor and fringe benefit costs of the Company employees involved in creating Capitalized Assets were capitalized, rather than expensed, and amortized over three years, as determined by their projected useful life. The Company did not capitalize any software development costs, as well as related network and data center costs, subsequent to January 31, 2020. Given business conditions in the aviation industry surrounding the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, the Company's software efforts were concentrated in the areas of maintenance of existing products.\nAs a result of the industry changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (described in Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic,\u201d above), the corresponding review conducted by the Company and the resultant write-offs taken during fiscal 2020, the Company anticipates that its level of capitalized software development costs, including related amortization of such costs, will continue to decrease in the future.\nCost of revenues decreased $3,900,000, or 63%, to $2,277,000 for the year ended October 31, 2021, as compared to $6,187,000 in fiscal year 2020. During fiscal year 2021, cost of revenues decreased as a result of decreases in personnel costs as well as reductions in depreciation and amortization expense and consulting costs, which were offset in part by a decrease in capitalized software development costs as a result of the Company not incurring any capitalized software costs subsequent to January 31, 2020. In response to the uncertainty surrounding the prospects of airlines and airports and the travel industry that began in fiscal year 2020 due to the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic (which uncertainty has continued), during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company undertook a review of its operating costs to more closely align those costs with its forecast for revenue. Prior to receiving CARES Act financing, the Company realized cost savings during fiscal 2020 from reductions in force, furloughs and temporary reductions in salaries, combined with the continued reduction in the use of outside development consultants. Also, as part of this review, the Company exited three leased facilities and terminated the related lease agreements. For the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company was able to use grants under the CARES Act and the Rescue Act to offset its compensation expense in cost of revenues by $1,995,000 and $473,000, respectively. Without the grants under the CARES Act and Rescue Act, Cost of revenues would have been $4,272,000 and $6,660,000 for the years ending October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Risk Factors.\u201d\nCosts of revenues was 37% of revenue in fiscal year 2021 compared with 54% in fiscal year 2020.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company's research and development efforts include activities associated with new product development, as well as the enhancement and improvement of the Company's existing software, and information products.\nResearch and development expenses decreased $131,000, or 39%, to $207,000 for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $338,000 for fiscal year 2020. The decrease in research and development was primarily attributable to a decrease in personnel related costs as compared to the prior year, as a result of the reductions in force and salary reduction programs discussed earlier. For the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company was able to use grants under the CARES Act and the Rescue Act to offset its research and development compensation expense by $127,000 and $16,000, respectively. Without the grants under the CARES Act and Rescue Act, Research and Development expenses would have been $334,000 and $354,000 for the years ending October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Risk Factors.\u201d\nThe Company anticipates that it will continue to invest in its software portfolio to develop, maintain, and support existing and newly developed applications for its customers. There were no customer-sponsored research and development activities during fiscal years 2021 and 2020. Research and development expenses are funded by current operations.\nSelling, General, and Administrative\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $3,947,000, or 61%, to $2,520,000 for the year ended October 31, 2021, as compared to $6,467,000 in the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in personnel related costs, professional and other consulting expenses, marketing and travel costs. These decreases were the result of the Company's concerted efforts to streamline its operations in line with the reduced level of revenue due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (as described above). For the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company was able to use proceeds from the PSP grants of the CARES Act and the Rescue Act to offset its compensation expense within selling, general and administrative expense by $2,456,000 and $641,000, respectively. Without the grants under the CARES Act and Rescue Act, Selling, general, and administrative expenses would have been $4,976,000 and $7,108,000 for the years ending October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Risk Factors.\u201d Also, as part of the review of its operating costs described above, the Company exited three leased facilities (during June and July 2020) and terminated the related lease agreements and reduced the leased square footage at another location. Annualized rent savings related to these undertakings represent approximately $311,000.\nImpairment Charges\nCertain of PASSUR's services traditionally relied on our proprietary network of sensors for aircraft surveillance. During the second quarter of 2020, in light of the FAA's mandate for ADS-B equipage on aircrafts operating in most U.S. airspace, effective January 2020, and parallel adoption of ADS-B requirements in much of the world, the Company performed a comprehensive review of its data feeds, specifically those associated with the PASSUR Network units and external ADS-B data feeds to determine if these external data feeds provide sufficient redundant data as to that generated from the existing PASSUR installations. The Company determined that such services could be powered by a combination of FAA data plus commercial ADS-B aggregator feeds and other date feeds available to the Company, which would provide a more cost-effective solution and allow the Company to focus more on value-added analytics and less on sensor technology. In this regard, the Company reviewed and decommissioned approximately half of the PASSUR Network system assets during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. As a result, the Company wrote off net assets applicable to the total book value of the PASSUR Network systems of approximately $3,565,000, and lease assets applicable to these PASSUR locations of approximately $175,000 during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, which amounts were included in the impairment charge for the year ended October 31, 2020. The write-off amount included PASSUR System and SMLAT System assets as well as inventory of finished and spare parts. The Company essentially completed the decommissioning process during fiscal year 2021.\nAs a result of the FAA mandate and the corresponding review conducted by the Company, which resulted in the commencement of the decommissioning of the PASSUR Network during fiscal year 2020, the Company anticipates that the costs of maintaining and operating these systems, including depreciation and related data feed costs, will decrease materially in the future.\nAdditionally, during the second quarter of 2020, given the impact of the current COVID-19 environment on customers, there was a sufficient amount of uncertainty surrounding the ability of customers to continue to perform their contracts with the Company and the Company's ability to generate revenue from such contracts. In order to determine whether or not an impairment had occurred, we looked at existing contracted revenue, adjusted for future uncertainties, and compared those amounts with the net carrying value of the related software development asset. Where the revenue amount was less than the net carrying value of the software development asset, we noted an impairment. As a result of this exercise, the Company wrote off previously capitalized software development costs totaling approximately $6,134,000 during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 due to impairment, given the impact of the current COVID-19 environment on the aviation industry and its customers, which amount was included in the impairment charge for the year ended October 31, 2020.\nThe Company did not capitalize any software development costs for any periods subsequent to January 31, 2020. As a result of the industry changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the corresponding review conducted by the Company during the second quarter of 2020 and the resultant write-offs, the Company anticipates that its level of capitalized software development, along with related amortization of such costs, will continue to decrease materially in the future.\nThe total amount of these charges and write-offs are included as an impairment charge for the year ended October 31, 2020 in the amount of $9,874,000.\nIncome/(Loss) from Operations\nIncome from operations for the year ended October 31, 2021 was $1,153,000, an increase of $12,490,000, or 110%, as compared to a loss from operations of $11,338,000 for the year ended October 31, 2020 (inclusive of the impact of the impairment charges recorded during the second quarter of 2020). Excluding the impact of the impairment charges of $9,874,000 in fiscal 2020, income from operations in fiscal 2021 improved by $2,616,000, or 179%, from a loss of $1,463,000 for the year ended October 31, 2020. The improvement in income from operations (excluding the impairment charges) was primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses of $7,988,000, or 62%, as compared to fiscal year 2020, which was partially offset by a decrease in revenue of $5,371,000, or 47%. Income from Operations for the year ended October 31, 2021 would have decreased by $4,578,000, to a loss of ($3,425,000) in the absence of funding from the CARES Act and Rescue Act, while the Loss from Operations for the year ended October 31, 2020 would have increased by $1,130,000 to ($12,468,000) in the absence of funding from the CARES Act.\nInterest Expense - Related Party\nInterest expense - related party for the year ended October 31, 2021 increased $150,000, or 17%, as compared to the same period in 2020, due to the higher average principal balances on the note payable to Mr. Gilbert (described below) during fiscal year 2021.\nIncome/(Loss) Before Income Taxes\nIncome before income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2021 increased $12,363,000, or 101%, to $96,000, as compared to the loss before income taxes of $12,267,000 for the fiscal year 2020 (including the effect of the impairment charges of $9,874,000 recorded during the second quarter of 2020). Excluding the impairment charges, income before income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2021 represented an improvement of $2,489,000 from the loss before income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2020. The improvement was the result of the cost control measures put in place during fiscal 2020. Income before income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2021 would have decreased by $4,578,000, to a loss of ($4,482,000) in the absence of funding from the CARES Act and Rescue Act, while the Loss before income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2020 would have increased by $1,130,000 to ($13,397,000) in the absence of funding from the CARES Act.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company's income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect the Company's best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. The Company's provision for income taxes in each fiscal year consists of federal and state taxes.\nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $3,000 on pre-tax income of $96,000, resulting in a 3% effective tax rate. The difference between the effective rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily related to pre-tax losses for which no tax benefit has been provided as the Company concluded that its deferred tax assets were not realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis.\nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $37,000 on a pre-tax loss of $12,267,000 (which includes the impact of the impairment charges of $9,874,000), resulting in a 0.3% effective tax rate. The difference between the effective rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily related to pre-tax losses for which no tax benefit has been provided as the Company concluded that its deferred tax assets were not realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis.\nNet Loss\nThe Company had net income of $93,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the year ended October 31, 2021, as compared to a net loss of $12,304,000, or $1.60 per diluted share, for fiscal year 2020 (inclusive of the impact of the impairment charges of $9,874,000 recorded during the second quarter of 2020). Net Income for the year ended October 31, 2021 would have decreased by $4,578,000, to a loss of ($4,485,000) in the absence of funding from the CARES Act and Rescue Act, while the Net Loss for the year ended October 31, 2020 would have increased by $1,130,000 to ($13,434,000) in the absence of funding from the CARES Act. See Risk Factors.\u201d\nImpact of Inflation\nIn the opinion of management, inflation did not have a material effect on the operations of the Company during fiscal year 2021, including selling prices, capital expenditures, and operating expenses. However, the increase in inflation during 2022 may, if continued, have a material adverse effect on the financial performance of the Company in fiscal 2022.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company's current assets exceeded its current liabilities (excluding deferred revenue and certain CARES Act grant proceeds) by $264,000 as of October 31, 2021. The Company also expended cash in operating activities of approximately $4.6 million and $1.4 million during the fiscal years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020. The note payable to a related party, G.S. Beckwith Gilbert, the Company's significant shareholder and Non-Executive Chairman of the Board, with a maturity of November 1, 2023 (upon the execution of the Eighth Debt Extension Agreement, described below), was $10,692,000 at October 31, 2021, which amount included additional loans made by Mr. Gilbert in fiscal 2020 of $1,435,000, bringing the principal balance owed to $9,585,000, plus capitalized accrued and unpaid interest of $1,107,000. The capitalized interest included $200,000 incurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and all the fiscal 2020 interest of $907,000. The Company has paid the interest due for the year ended October 31, 2021 in the amount of $1,057,000. During the year ended October 31, 2021, Mr. Gilbert did not loan the Company any additional funds. The Company's stockholders' equity had a deficit of $11,042,000 at October 31, 2021. The Company achieved net income of $93,000 for the year ended October 31, 2021.\nAs of October 31, 2020, the total amount owed by the Company under a promissory note issued by the Company to Mr. Gilbert on January 27, 2020 (the Sixth Gilbert Note\u201d) was $10,692,000, consisting of a principal of $9,585,000 (which included the principal of $8,670,000 outstanding under the Sixth Gilbert Note and an additional amount of $915,000 loaned to the Company by Mr. Gilbert during the period from January 27, 2020 to October 31, 2020) and unpaid accrued interest of $1,107,000 (which included unpaid interest of $401,000 accrued under a promissory note previously issued by the Company to Mr. Gilbert that was included in the Sixth Gilbert Note and unpaid interest\nunder the Sixth Gilbert Note through October 31, 2020). The maturity date under the Sixth Gilbert Note was November 1, 2021, and the annual interest rate was 9 \u00be%, with annual interest payments required to be made on October 31st of each year. The note payable was secured by the Company's assets.\nOn January 26, 2022, the Company and Mr. Gilbert entered into an Eighth Debt Extension Agreement, effective as of January 26, 2022, pursuant to which the Company cancelled the Seventh Gilbert Note and issued Mr. Gilbert a new promissory note (the Eighth Gilbert Note\u201d) in the amount of $10,692,000. Under the terms of the Eighth Gilbert Note, the maturity date of the loan was extended to November 1, 2023, and the annual interest rate remained 9 \u00be%, with annual interest payments required to be made on October 31st of each year (although any accrued interest can be paid before such time without penalty). The note payable is secured by the Company's assets.\nOn January 29, 2021, the Company and Mr. Gilbert entered into a Seventh Debt Extension Agreement, effective as of January 29, 2021, pursuant to which the Company cancelled the Sixth Gilbert Note and issued Mr. Gilbert a new promissory note (the Seventh Gilbert Note\u201d) in the amount of $10,692,000, consisting of a principal of $9,585,000 and unpaid interest of $1,107,000 accrued under the Sixth Gilbert Note through October 31, 2020. Under the terms of the Seventh Gilbert Note, the Company agreed to pay the unpaid interest of $1,107,000 accrued under the Sixth Gilbert Note and included in the Seventh Gilbert Note, (as described above) at the time and on the terms set forth in the Seventh Gilbert Note. Under the terms of the Seventh Gilbert Note, the maturity date of the loan was extended to November 1, 2022, and the annual interest rate remained 9 \u00be%, with annual interest payments required to be made on October 31st of each year (although any accrued interest can be paid before such time without penalty). The note payable is secured by the Company's assets. The amendments to the Sixth Gilbert Note were determined to be a modification of the debt instrument and no gain or loss was recorded as a result of the transactions. During the year ended October 31, 2021, the Company paid all accrued interest due for the fiscal 2021 year under the Sixth Gilbert Note and the Seventh Gilbert Note in the amount of $1,057,000.\nManagement believes that the continued development of its existing suite of software products and professional services, which address the wide array of needs of the aviation industry, will continue to lead to increased growth in the Company's customer-base and subscription-based revenues. However, there are no assurances that such growth will be achieved.\nIf the Company's business plan does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet the Company's operating cash requirements, the Company will attempt to obtain external financing on commercially reasonable terms. However, the Company has received a commitment from Mr. Gilbert, dated January 26, 2022, that if the Company, at any time, is unable to meet its obligations through January 27, 2023, Mr. Gilbert will provide the necessary continuing financial support to the Company in order for the Company to meet such obligations. Such commitment for financial support may be in the form of additional advances or loans to the Company, in addition to the deferral of principal and/or interest payments due on the existing loans, if deemed necessary.\nThe CARES Act, enacted in March 2020, as well as subsequently enacted legislation, including the Rescue Act, have provided economic support for, among others, businesses in the aviation industry. The Company has received grants under both the CARES Act and the Rescue Act, totaling approximately $6,498,000, as described in more detail below.\n1.The Company has been granted government funds of approximately $3.0 million pursuant to the PSP1 for Air Carriers and Contractors under the CARES Act. Pursuant to the Payroll Support Program Agreement entered into by the Company with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Company has agreed to, among other things, refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs and reducing employee rates of pay or benefits through September 30, 2020, refrain from paying dividends or engaging in share repurchases through September 30, 2021. The Payroll Support Program Agreement also requires the Company to limit certain executive compensation through March 24, 2022, maintain certain internal controls and records relating to the CARES Act funds and comply with certain reporting requirements.\n2.On February 12, 2021, the Company received an additional top off\u201d disbursement of $875,000 under PSP1, subject to the terms and conditions described above.\n3.On March 5, 2021, the Company entered into a Payroll Support Program Extension Agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury for an award the Company received under the CARES Act Payroll Support Program ( PSP2\u201d). The total amount awarded to the Company under PSP2 was approximately $1,310,000. The relief payments under PSP2 were received in two installments of approximately $655,000 each on March 8, 2021 and April 26, 2021. As with the original grant under PSP1, PSP2 proceeds are to be used exclusively for the continuation of payment of certain employee wages, salaries, and benefits. The Company has used such relief payments for such purpose. The Payroll Support Program Extension Agreement provides that the relief payments are conditioned on the Company's agreement to, among other things, refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs through the later of March 31, 2021, or the date on which the Company has expended all of the payroll support, as well as other conditions including prohibitions on share repurchases and dividends through March 31, 2022, and certain limitations on executive compensation.\n4.On April 16, 2021, the Company entered into a Payroll Support Program 3 Agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury for an award the Company received under the Rescue Act ( PSP3\u201d). The total amount awarded to the Company under PSP3 was approximately $1,310,000. The first installment, in the amount of approximately $655,000, was received by the Company\non April 29, 2021. The second installment of approximately $655,000 was received by the Company on May 27, 2021. The Company does not anticipate any additional stimulus grant payments under the Payroll Support Programs. As with the original grants under PSP1 and PSP2, proceeds under PSP3 are to be used exclusively for the continuation of payment of certain employee wages, salaries, and benefits. The Company has used such proceeds for such purpose. The Payroll Support Program 3 Agreement provides that the relief payments are conditioned on the Company's agreement to, among other things, refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs through the later of September 30, 2021, or the date on which the Company has expended all of the payroll support under PSP3, as well as other conditions including prohibitions on share repurchases and dividends through September 30, 2022, and certain limitations on executive compensation. The amount of unused stimulus funding as of October 31 2021 and 2020 was $856,000 and $1,934,000 (exclusive of $3,495,000 in grants received after October 31, 2020), respectively, and is shown in the balance sheet under current liabilities as Accrued Liabilities - Stimulus Funding.\nThe Company believes that it has operated in compliance with all the provisions and requirements under the CARES Act up through and including the period ended October 31, 2021, and fully intends to continue to comply with all such provisions and requirements. Consequently, the Company has accounted for the advanced funds as grants not requiring repayment and recognized such amounts in income as qualifying salaries, wages and benefits have been incurred. During the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company reduced its compensation expenses by $4,578,000 and $1,130,000, respectively, as CARES Act and Rescue Act grant proceeds received by the Company were used to fund eligible payroll costs. If the Company does not comply with the provisions of the CARES Act, the Rescue Act and the Payroll Support Program Agreements, the Company may be required to repay the government funds and also be subject to other remedies.\nNet cash used by operating activities was ($4,618,000) for the year ended October 31, 2021, as compared to ($1,363,000) for the year ended October 31, 2020. Net cash used by operating activities in the current fiscal year consisted of net income of $93,000, adjusted for the effects of the federal stimulus credits utilized of ($4,578,000), depreciation and amortization of $708,000, stock-based compensation expense of $223,000, changes in operating lease assets and liabilities of ($126,000) and changes in the provision for doubtful accounts of ($45,000). Additionally, cash used in operations was negatively impacted by changes in accounts payable of ($755,000), accounts receivable of ($101,000) prepaids and other current assets of ($88,000) and accrued expenses of ($27,000), partially offset by changes in deferred revenue and other assets of $78,000. The decrease in cash from operations in fiscal 2021 as compared with 2020 was the result of lower levels of revenue experienced by the Company as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Net cash used in investing activities was $55,000 for the year ended October 31, 2021, which was expended primarily for the purchase of capital equipment, primarily computers and servers. The decrease in capitalized software development costs in fiscal 2021 as compared with 2020 was the result of the Company's decision to focus on maintenance and support of existing products, as a result of the change in business conditions experienced in the industry, particularly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Net cash provided by financing activities was $3,494,000 for year ended October 31, 2021 and was the result of grant proceeds received under the Payroll Support Programs of the CARES Act and the Rescue Act of $3,494,000 during fiscal 2021. The Company received a total of approximately $6,500,000 of grant proceeds under the Payroll Support Programs of the CARES Act and the Rescue Act during the two-year period ended October 31, 2021, and does not anticipate receiving any additional funds under these programs at the current time.\nThe Company actively monitors the costs associated with supporting the business, and continually seeks to identify and reduce any unnecessary costs as part of its cost reduction initiatives, while strategically reinvesting back into the business as part of its long-term plans. As described above, during fiscal 2020, the Company took aggressive steps to reduce its cost structure, including, but not limited to, reductions in force, furloughs and salary reduction plans. The Company will continue to monitor costs in relation to its revenue and will take further actions as necessary consistent with the requirements of the CARES Act financing. The Company believes that it has the ability to reduce operating costs further if, at any time, such adjustments would be necessary to align the Company's financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources with the uncertain outlook of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, if the recovery of the air transportation industry accelerates and revenue levels quickly return to pre-COVID-19 levels, the levels of cost savings already taken, or which may be taken by the Company may not be practical or sustainable to support the operations necessary for the increased level of revenue. Additionally, the aviation market has been impacted by budgetary constraints, airline bankruptcies and consolidations, current economic conditions, the continued war on terrorism, and fluctuations in fuel costs. The aviation market is extensively regulated by government agencies, particularly the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board, and management anticipates that new regulations relating to air travel may continue to be issued. Substantially all of the Company's revenues are derived from customers that serve, or are served by, the aviation industry. Any new regulations or changes in the economic situation of the aviation industry could have an impact on the future operations of the Company, either positively or negatively.\nDespite the continuing downturn in the air transportation industry due to the COVID-19 pandemic, interest by potential customers in the Company's information and decision support software products and its professional services remains strong. As a result, the Company believes that, subject to the factors described under Risk Factors\u201d, future revenues will increase on an annualized basis. However, there are no guarantees that such annualized future revenue increases will occur in the absence of funding under the CARES Act and Rescue Act. If revenues do not increase and the Company's cost-structure is not adjusted accordingly, losses may occur. The extent of such profits or losses will be dependent on sales volume achieved and the Company's ability to optimize its cost structures. See Risk Factors.\u201d\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, based upon accounting policies management has implemented. The Company has identified the policies and estimates below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the Company's business operations are discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, where such policies affect its reported financial results. The actual impact of these factors may differ under different assumptions or conditions. The Company's accounting policies that require management to apply significant judgment and estimates include:\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company derives revenue primarily from subscription-based, real-time decision and solution information and professional services. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nThe Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u00b7Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u00b7Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u00b7Determination of transaction price;\n\u00b7Allocation of transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u00b7Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nA.Nature of performance obligations\nSubscription services revenue\nSubscription services revenue is comprised of cloud-based subscription fees that provide the customer the right to access the Company's software and receive support and updates, if any, for a period of time. The Company has determined such access represents a stand-ready service provided continually throughout the contract term. As such, control and satisfaction of this stand-ready performance obligation is deemed to occur over time. The Company's subscription contracts include a fixed amount of consideration that is recognized ratably over the non-cancelable contract term, beginning on the date that access is made available to the customer. The passage of time is deemed to be the most faithful depiction of the transfer of control of the services as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit provided by the Company's performance. Subscription contracts are generally one to three years in length, billed either monthly, quarterly or annually, typically in advance, which coincides with the terms of the agreement. The Company's subscription contracts do not have a significant financing component and customer invoices are typically due within 30 days. There is no significant variable consideration related to these arrangements. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred.\nProfessional services revenue\nProfessional services primarily consist of value assessments and customer training services. Payment for professional services is generally a fixed fee or a fee based on time and materials. The obligation to provide professional services is generally satisfied over time, with the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits as the Company satisfies its performance obligations. For professional services, revenue is recognized by measuring progress toward the complete satisfaction of the Company's obligation. Progress for services that are contracted for a fixed price is generally measured based on hours incurred as a portion of total estimated hours, and as a practical expedient, progress for services that are contracted for time and materials is generally based on the amount the Company has the right to invoice. Professional services contracts are generally one year or less in length, billed either in advance, upon pre-defined milestones or as services are rendered, which coincides with the terms of the agreement. The Company's professional service contracts do not have a significant financing component and customer invoices are typically due within 30 days.\nMaterial rights\nContracts with customers may include material rights which are also performance obligations. Material rights primarily arise when the contract gives the customer the right to renew subscription services at a discounted price in the future. This may occur from time to time when the Company's contracts provide an implicit discount as the customer pays a nonrefundable up-front fee in connection with the initial services contract that it does not have to pay again in order to renew the service. These non-refundable up-front fees are not related to any promised service that the customer benefits from other than providing access to the subscription service. Revenue allocated to material rights is recognized when the customer exercises the right over the estimated renewal period of five years or when the right expires. If exercised by the customer, the amount previously deferred for the material right is included in the transaction price of the renewal contract and allocated to the services included in that contract. If expired, revenue is recognized as subscription services revenue in the period the right expired. If the up-front fees do not provide the customer with a material right, then the amount is included in the transaction price of the initial services contract and allocated to the performance obligations in that contract.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nSome of the Company's contracts with customers contain multiple distinct performance obligations. For these contracts, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price the Company would charge for a specific service if it was sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. The Company maximizes the use of directly observable transactions to determine the standalone selling prices for its performance obligations. For subscription services, the Company separately determines the standalone selling prices by type of solution and customer demographics. For professional services, the Company separately determines standalone selling price by type of services.\nOther policies and judgments\nThe commissions that the Company pays for obtaining a contract with a customer are conditional on future service provided by the employee. Therefore, since these costs are not incremental solely based on obtaining a contract, the Company does not defer any commission costs.\nSome of the Company's contracts with its customers contain multiple performance obligations subject to allocation of transaction prices. Some contracts contain material rights, in the form of non-refundable up-front fees. Such fees are amortized to income over an estimated average customer life. Differences in actual average customer life compared with estimates may result in changes to amounts amortized to income. In the case of professional services, revenue recognition may be dependent on estimating the amount of time needed to complete various tasks within a contract and estimating the actual amount of completion at any point in time. Revisions to such estimates at any time may result in adjustments to the amounts of revenue recognized.\nCapitalized Software Development Costs\nAs discussed further in Note (1) Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies, to the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Company capitalizes costs related to the development of internal use software in accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the FASB on internal-use software, ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software.\u201d The Company expenses all costs incurred during the preliminary project stage of its development, and capitalizes the costs incurred during the application development stage. For periods through October 31, 2021, costs incurred relating to upgrades and enhancements to the software were capitalized if it had been determined that these upgrades or enhancements add additional functionality to the software. Costs incurred to maintain and support products after they became available were charged to expense as incurred. The Company did not capitalize any software development costs subsequent to January 31, 2020, resulting from the Company's decision to focus on maintenance and support of existing products, as a result of the change in business conditions experienced in the industry, particularly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, due to the financial and economic hardships being experienced by airlines, airports and air transportation support vendors in the current COVID-19 environment, there was a sufficient amount of uncertainty surrounding the ability of our customers to continue to perform their contracts with the Company. In order to determine whether or not an impairment had occurred, the Company looked at existing contracted revenue, adjusted for future uncertainties, and compared those amounts with the net carrying value of the related capitalized development cost asset. Where the contribution margin was less than the net carrying value of the asset, we determined that an impairment had occurred. As a result of this exercise, the Company wrote-off assets totaling $6,134,000 during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, based on the assumption that the carrying value of the software capitalization was representative of 100% of the committed contract values then remaining, given the impact of the current COVID-19 environment on the aviation industry and its customers.\nAs a result of the industry changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the corresponding review conducted by the Company described above and the resultant write-offs taken, the Company anticipates that its level of capitalized software development costs, including related amortization of such costs, will continue to decrease in the future.\nAs of October 31, 2021, and 2020, the Company had $738,000 and $1,223,000, respectively, of software development costs, net of amortization. The Company has a formal program to determine when additional functionality of a product is established and assumptions are used that reflect the Company's best estimates. Software development costs are reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable\nvalue. Net realizable value is computed as the estimated gross future revenue from each software solution less the amount of estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product. Software costs are included in Capitalized software development costs, net\u201d on the Company's balance sheet and are depreciated using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of three years.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nAs discussed further in Note (1) Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies, to the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 360-10, Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.\u201d The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized to the extent the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of their carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell. The Company evaluates the periods of amortization continually in determining whether later events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives. If estimates are changed, the unamortized costs will be allocated to the increased or decreased number of remaining periods in the revised life.\nAll of the Company's capitalized assets are recorded at cost (which may also include salaries incurred during production and/or development) and depreciated and/or amortized over the asset's estimated useful life for financial statement purposes. The estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the Company and is determined by management based on many factors, including historical experience with similar assets, technological life cycles, and industry standards for similar assets. Circumstances and events relating to these assets are monitored to ensure that changes in asset lives or impairments are identified and prospective depreciation or impairment expense is adjusted accordingly.\nAt each reporting period, management evaluates the carrying values of the Company's assets. The evaluation considers the undiscounted cash flows generated from current contractual revenue sources and the anticipated forecast revenue derived from each asset. The Company then evaluates these revenues on an overall basis to determine if any impairment issues exist. The Company did not have any increases in inventory reserves, impairment charges or write-offs during fiscal year 2021.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nAs of October 31, 2021, the PASSUR Network, net, Capitalized software development costs, net, and Property and equipment, net totaled $0, $738,000, and $93,000, respectively. The PASSUR Network, net, Capitalized software development costs, net, and Property and equipment, net totaled $0, $1,223,000, and $258,000, respectively, as of October 31, 2020. In management's judgment, the estimated depreciable lives used to calculate the annual depreciation and amortization expense are appropriate.\nDepreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:\nTable 6: <table><tr><td>PASSUR Network\n</td> <td>5 to 7 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized software development costs\n</td> <td>3 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and equipment\n</td> <td>3 to 10 years\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe PASSUR Network was comprised of PASSUR and SMLAT Systems, which included the direct production, shipping, and installation costs incurred for each PASSUR and SMLAT System, which were recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation was charged to cost of revenues and was recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which was estimated at five years for SMLAT Systems and seven years for PASSUR Systems. PASSUR and SMLAT Systems which were not installed, raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods components were carried at cost and not depreciated until installed. During the second quarter of 2020, in light of the FAA's mandate for ADS-B equipage on aircrafts operating in most U.S. airspace effective January 2020, and parallel adoption of ADS-B requirements in much of the world, the Company determined that services that traditionally had relied on the PASSUR proprietary network of sensors for aircraft surveillance could be powered by a combination of FAA data plus commercial ADS-B aggregator feeds and other data feeds available to the Company, which would provide a more cost-effective solution and allow us to focus more on value-added analytics, and less on sensor technology. In this regard, the Company reviewed and decommissioned approximately half of the PASSUR Network system assets during fiscal 2020. As a result, the Company wrote off net assets applicable to the total book value of the PASSUR Network systems of approximately $3,565,000, and lease assets applicable to these PASSUR locations of approximately $175,000, which amounts were included in the impairment charge for fiscal year 2020. The write-off amount included PASSUR System and SMLAT System assets as well as inventory of finished and spare parts. The Company essentially completed the decommissioning process during fiscal year 2021.\nTotal depreciation and amortization expense was $708,000 for the year ended October 31, 2021. This consisted of $219,000 of depreciation expense related to Property and equipment, $486,000 of amortization expense related to Capitalized software development costs, and $3,000 related to one-time fee amortization. For the year ended October 31, 2020, total depreciation and amortization expense was $2,123,000. This consisted of $652,000 of depreciation expense related to the PASSUR Network and Property and equipment, $1,451,000 of amortization expense related to Capitalized software development costs, and $20,000 related to one-time fee amortization.\nAccounting for Federal Payroll Support Program ( PSP\u201d) Funds\nPSP funds received under the CARES Act and the Rescue Act during fiscal years 2020 and 2021 are accounted for as grants not requiring repayment. The Company recognizes such amounts received in income as qualifying salaries, wages and benefits are incurred. The PSP funds advanced are conditioned upon the Company complying with certain provisions and requirements included in the agreements. If the Company does not comply with the provisions and requirements therein, the PSP funds advanced would be subject to repayment. The Company believes that it is in compliance with all provisions and requirements under the agreements for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021.\nStock-Based Compensation\nAs discussed further in Note (9) Stock-Based Compensation to the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Company accounts for share-based awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the FASB on stock compensation, FASB ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation,\u201d which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant, and recognition of stock-based compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model to compute the estimated fair value of share-based compensation expense. The Black-Scholes valuation model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected option term and risk-free interest rates. The assumptions used in computing the fair value of share-based compensation expense reflect the Company's best estimates, but involve uncertainties relating to market volatilities, the historical volatility of the Company's stock price, risk-free rates, expected life, and other conditions, many of which are outside of the Company's control. Determining these assumptions is subjective and complex and a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock option grants and associated compensation expense. Additionally, the Company accounts for forfeitures when they occur. Stock-based compensation expense was $223,000 and $467,000 for the year ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and was primarily included in selling, general, and administrative expenses.\nOn August 16, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors adopted the Second Amendment to the Plan, to authorize the granting of restricted stock unit (RSU) awards under the Plan. Each RSU represents the right to receive, following vesting, one share of the Company's Common Stock. In connection with the Second Amendment to the Plan, the Board of Directors has authorized an aggregate of 800,000 RSU awards to be granted under the Plan. As of October 31, 2021, 797,500 RSU awards were granted under the Plan at a grant date fair market value of $0.63 per share, which RSU awards vest ratably over a three-year period. All 797,500 RSU awards were granted on October 22, 2021.\nIncome Taxes\nAt October 31, 2021, the Company had available a federal net operating loss carry-forward of $26,239,000 for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Approximately $12,780,000 of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various tax years from fiscal year 2022 through fiscal year 2038. These net operating losses are available to offset 100% of future taxable income. The remaining $13,459,000 of U.S. federal net operating loss may be carried forward indefinitely but are only available to offset 80% of future taxable income.\nThe Company evaluates whether a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is required each reporting period. A valuation allowance is established if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized. After weighing all available positive and negative evidence, including cumulative losses in recent years, the Company continues to conclude that the more likely than not threshold for the realization of deferred tax assets has not been met.\nThe Company follows ASC 740, Income Taxes,\u201d where tax benefits are recognized only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits are tax benefits claimed in tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards. At October 31, 2021, the Company did not have any uncertain tax positions. As permitted by ASC 740-10, the Company's accounting policy is to prospectively classify accrued interest and penalties related to any unrecognized tax benefits in its income tax provision.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") was enacted to provide economic relief to those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act made various tax law changes, including, among other things: (i) modifications to the federal net operating loss rules, including permitting federal net operating losses incurred in 2018, 2019, and 2020 to be carried back to the five preceding taxable years in order to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes; (ii) enhanced recoverability of AMT tax credit carryforwards; (iii) delayed payment of employer payroll taxes; (iv) increased the limitation on business interest expenses under IRC Section 163(j) for the 2019 and 2020 tax years to permit additional expensing of interest; and (v) enacted a technical correction so that qualified improvement property can be immediately expensed under IRC Section 168(k). As of October 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $26,239,000 of net operating losses, which cannot be carried back to prior years to generate tax refunds since no tax had been paid in those years by the Company.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which amends the ASC and creates Topic 842, Leases ( Topic 842\u201d). Topic 842 requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP on the balance sheet. On November 1, 2019, the Company adopted Topic 842. As a result of the adoption of Topic 842, the Company recognized operating lease right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) assets and liabilities of $1,497,000 and $1,620,000, respectively. The Company does not have any finance lease ROU assets and liabilities. There was no change to our consolidated statements of operations or cash flows, as a result of the adoption. During the year ended October 31, 2020, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $175,000 in connection with the leases related to its PASSUR Network System asset locations.\nAccounting Pronouncements Issued but not yet Adopted\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes Topic 740-Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\u201d ( ASU 2019-12\u201d), which intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application of Topic 740. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods therein, and early adoption is permitted. Adoption of Topic 740 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Current Expected Credit Losses\u201d ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which introduces an impairment model based on expected, rather than incurred, losses. Additionally, it requires expanded disclosures regarding (a) credit risk inherent in a portfolio and how management monitors the portfolio's credit quality; (b) management's estimate of expected credit losses; and (c) changes in estimates of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company has not yet quantified the impact of ASU 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements. However, it is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.", "summary": "The report discusses the company's financial condition and results of operations for the year ended October 31, 2021.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nResults of Operations\nGeneral\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities based upon accounting policies management has implemented. The Company has identified the policies and estimates below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the Company's business operations are discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, where such policies affect its reported financial results. The actual impact of these factors may differ under different assumptions or conditions.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nDuring the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, the aviation and travel industries, which are served by the Company and its products, were severely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Travel restrictions and other measures imposed by most jurisdictions, coupled with the public's reluctance to travel during this time, resulted in a precipitous decline in demand for air travel, and our customers in the aviation and travel industries drastically reduced their capacity and operations from 2020 into 2021 as compared to 2019, which in turn has resulted in a significant reduction of demand for our products and services. As a result, the Company has faced increased economic pressures and experienced a significant loss of revenue during the two-year period ended October 31, 2021. The Company anticipates a return to an improved economic environment in fiscal 2022 given the state of vaccinations, treatments available, and changes in public behaviors. The recovery, however, depends on many factors, the outcomes of which are uncertain or unknown at this time, such as, among other things, the scope, severity and duration of any variants to the COVID-19 virus, the continuing actions to contain the pandemic or to mitigate its impact, the acceptance and public distribution of treatments and vaccines for the disease (including its variants), and the length of time before the public feels safe to travel. All of these variables will impact how quickly the industry can recover and may affect the revenue and earnings levels of the Company. See Risk Factors\u201d.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d), enacted in March 2020, as well as subsequently enacted legislation, including the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the Rescue Act\u201d), have provided economic support for, among others, businesses in the airline industry. The Company has received grants under both the CARES Act and the Rescue Act (collectively referred to herein as CARES Act grants\u201d), totaling approximately $6,498,000, as described in more detail below.\n1.In July 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury to receive an aggregate of $3,003,000 in emergency relief through the CARES Act Payroll Support Program ( PSP1\u201d). The relief payments were received in three installments from July 2020 through September 2020. Pursuant to the Payroll Support Program Agreement, the relief payments must be used exclusively for the continuation of payment of certain employee wages, salaries and benefits. The Company has used such relief payments for such purpose. The Payroll Support Program Agreement provides that the relief payments are conditioned on the Company's agreement to, among other things, refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs through September 30, 2020, as well as other conditions including prohibitions on share repurchases and dividends through September 30, 2021, and certain limitations on executive compensation.\n2.On February 12, 2021, the Company received an additional top off\u201d disbursement of $875,000 under PSP1, subject to the terms and conditions described above.\n3.On March 5, 2021, the Company entered into a Payroll Support Program Extension Agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury for an award the Company received under the CARES Act Payroll Support Program ( PSP2\u201d). The total amount awarded to the Company under PSP2 was approximately $1,310,000. The relief payments under PSP2 were received in two installments of approximately $655,000 each on March 8, 2021 and April 26, 2021. As with the original grant under PSP1, PSP2 proceeds are to be used exclusively for the continuation of payment of certain employee wages, salaries, and benefits. The Company has used such relief payments for such purpose. The Payroll Support Program Extension Agreement for PSP2 provides that the relief payments are conditioned on the Company's agreement to, among other things, refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs through the later of March 31, 2021, or the date on which the Company has expended all of the payroll support, as well as other conditions including prohibitions on share repurchases and dividends through March 31, 2022, and certain limitations on executive compensation.\n4.On April 16, 2021, the Company entered into a Payroll Support Program 3 Agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury for an award the Company received under the Rescue Act (PSP3\u201d). The total amount awarded to the Company under PSP3 was approximately $1,310,000. The first installment, in the amount of approximately $655,000, was received by the Company on April 29, 2021. The second installment of approximately $655,000 was received by the Company on May 27, 2021. The Company does not anticipate any additional stimulus grant payments under the Payroll Support Programs. As with the original\ngrants under PSP1 and PSP2, proceeds under PSP3 are to be used exclusively for the continuation of payment of certain employee wages, salaries, and benefits. The Company has used such proceeds for such purpose. The Payroll Support Program 3 Agreement provides that the relief payments are conditioned on the Company's agreement to, among other things, refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs through the later of September 30, 2021, or the date on which the Company has expended all of the payroll support under PSP3, as well as other conditions including prohibitions on share repurchases and dividends through September 30, 2022, and certain limitations on executive compensation. The amount of unused stimulus funding as of October 31 2021 and 2020 was $856,000 and $1,934,000 (exclusive of $3,495,000 in grants received after October 31, 2020), respectively, and is shown in the balance sheet under current liabilities as Accrued Liabilities - Stimulus Funding.\nThe Company believes that it has operated in compliance with all the provisions and requirements under the CARES Act and the Rescue Act during the two-year period ended October 31, 2021 and fully intends to continue to comply with all such provisions and requirements. Consequently, the Company has accounted for the advanced funds as grants not requiring repayment and recognized such amounts in income as qualifying salaries, wages and benefits have been incurred. During the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company reduced its compensation expense by $4,578,000 and $1,130,000, respectively, as the CARES Act grant proceeds received by the Company were used to fund eligible payroll costs. If the Company does not comply with the provisions of the CARES Act, the Rescue Act and the Payroll Support Program Agreements, the Company may be required to repay the government funds and also be subject to other remedies.\nAdditionally, provisions under the CARES Act allow the Company to defer payment of the employer's share of social security taxes incurred from March of 2020 through December 31, 2020. The amount of payroll taxes subject to deferred payment is approximately $139,000. Under the terms of the legislation, 50% of the deferred payroll taxes were due and paid by December 31, 2021, and the remaining 50% are due and payable by December 31, 2022.\nThe Company has taken several actions beginning in April 2020 and prior to receiving CARES Act funds, to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business, as outlined below:\n\u00b7Eliminated or furloughed approximately one-third of then-existing positions (all furloughed employees were offered an opportunity to return, subsequent to the Company receiving the CARES Act funds);\n\u00b7Instituted a temporary pay reduction plan affecting essentially all of the then-remaining employees;\n\u00b7Reduced the use of outside consultants;\n\u00b7Decommissioned the PASSUR Network to reduce data feed and telecom costs; and\n\u00b7Reduced and/or eliminated other operating expenses that were not critical to the short-term outlook of the Company.\nThe effects of the actions above were reflected in lower costs of revenues, research and development and administrative costs in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, compared to fiscal 2019, and the Company anticipates that such cost savings will continue into fiscal 2022. However, if the recovery of the air transportation industry accelerates and revenue levels quickly return to pre-COVID-19 levels, these levels of cost savings may not be practicable or sustainable to support the operations necessary for the increased level of revenue. See Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nPASSUR is a global leader in digital operational excellence. The Company's trusted platform, combined with professional services, helps customers reduce operational complexity and lower operating expenses.\nOperational efficiency is more important now than ever to eliminate sources of waste, variability, and inflexibility in operations. The Company addresses these significant industry problems by using our technology platform, combined with professional services, to provide solutions that predict, prioritize, prevent and help the industry recover from unexpected disruptions. These disruptions have long been seen as the cost of doing business in the industry and are even more pronounced today and create greater uncertainty to the industry. The Company provides actionable intelligence to enable the industry to manage their operations more efficiently and increase profits.\nThe Company provides its solutions to airlines and airports in the U.S., as well as an airline in Latin America. The global market presents an opportunity to network more customers in a broader market.\nOur core business addresses some of the aviation industry's most intractable and costly challenges, including, but not limited to, underutilization of airspace and airport capacity, delays, cancellations, and diversions. Several independent studies have estimated the annual direct costs of such inefficiencies to airlines in the United States at over $8 billion annually and worldwide direct cost at over $30 billion annually.\nSolutions offered by PASSUR help to ensure flight completion. They cover the entire flight life cycle, from gate to gate, and result in reductions in overall costs and carbon emissions, while maximizing revenue opportunities, improving operational efficiency, and enhancing the passenger experience.\nThe Company's revenues are generated by selling: (1) subscription-based real-time decision and information solutions; and (2) professional services.\nThe Company's major achievements during fiscal year 2021 are summarized below:\nDespite the ongoing difficulties that the COVID-19 pandemic presented for the aviation industry, PASSUR was able to secure 19 new contracts with a mix of new customers and existing customers with incremental revenue and renew 42 of 48 contracts, with the six losses directly attributed to reduced flight volumes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2021, PASSUR:\n\u00b7Launched a new data service (ARiVADATA ) in August, 2021, leading to several new customer wins\n\u00b7Continued to enhance the ARiVATM platform, aligned to revenue and market opportunities\n\u00b7Began the process of migrating from our co-location infrastructure to a cloud based, secure, resilient, and scalable platform\n\u00b7Integrated an additional 25,000 terrestrial ADS-B sensors, completed the integration of Aireon satellite surface and in-flight data feeds\n\u00b7Enhanced the value of the ARiVATM platform through improvements in implementation of machine learning capabilities and enhanced algorithms\nKey 2021 Developments\nIntroduction of the ARiVADATA Data Service\nARiVADATA is one of the market leading aviation data solutions, designed to reduce operating costs by providing predictive and real-time insights into complex aviation operations, delivered through an application program interface (API). Some features include:\n\u00b7Global predictive aircraft situational awareness through machine learning\n\u00b7Real time operations control (airborne operations and airfield operations)\n\u00b7Gate-to-gate surface and airborne tracking on a single platform\n\u00b7Compliance with the ICAO GADSS mandate (described below)\n\u00b7Traffic analysis\n\u00b7Statistical reporting\nAs of January 1, 2023, the ICAO GADSS mandate requires aircraft to be continuously tracked anywhere in the globe, including over water, mountains, and other uncontrolled airspace, with a minimum update rate of 15 minutes - switching to updates every one (1) minute under distress conditions.\u201d\nIn 2021, PASSUR was able to create the ARiVA Global Feed (AGF), which fuses over 44 data feeds, including from multiple government, ANSP, and commercial surveillance sources. AGF consolidates in one feed all of the data required by operators and aviation software support companies to maintain GADSS aircraft tracking compliance.\nNew Customer Wins and Renewals\nDuring 2021, despite the ongoing difficulties that the COVID-19 pandemic presented for the aviation industry, in a testament to our ability to meet customer needs and continue to assist them in achieving meaningful operational savings, PASSUR was able to secure 19 new contract wins, through a mix of new customers and existing customers with incremental revenue, on our new ARiVATM platform, while at the same time renewing and migrating 42 customer contracts, from our legacy services to the ARiVATM platform. New wins and renewals crossed all customer segments, including Airports, Airlines as well as FBOs.\nExpansion of the PASSUR Partnership Footprint\nPASSUR has now taken what we believe to be a market leading position in terms of our global ADS-B coverage through the addition of the AirNav Systems ADS-B network into our satellite and existing extensive terrestrial ADS-B coverage.\nMigration of the ARiVATM Platform to Cloud-Based Computing\nIn 2020, PASSUR took the opportunity to migrate away from a hardware-based data collection platform and become an aggregator of global data. In 2021, PASSUR started a similar journey to migrate from our legacy, hardware-based co-location infrastructure platform, to a cloud-based platform. Starting with development instances, the Company believes that it is poised to successfully transition all of our key products to the cloud by the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. We believe this will aid PASSUR in achieving greater security, resiliency, and cost performance, in addition to positioning us for scalable growth moving forward.\nSetting the Stage for Global Expansion\nIn the past, PASSUR revenue growth was challenged due to dependencies on its proprietary hardware network, deployed at specific locations, mainly within the continental United States. Over the last 18 months, PASSUR has gone through a major evolution to become a next-generation SaaS company and has focused on sourcing and aggregating global data feeds (satellite as well as terrestrial), as well as additional data or information required to enhance the ARiVATM platform's effectiveness. As part of this evolution, PASSUR substantially enhanced our platform capabilities to enable new and existing services to be delivered across all customer segments on a global basis. These enhancements include improvements to our artificial intelligence/machine learning engine, visualization, alerting, and collaborative decision-making capabilities.\nBy delivering these enhancements in 2021, PASSUR believes, subject to the factors described under Risk Factors\u201d, that it is now optimally positioned to service all stakeholders within the aviation industry on a global basis.\nPASSUR Network\nCertain of PASSUR's services traditionally relied on our proprietary network of sensors for aircraft surveillance - the PASSUR and Surface Multilateration ( SMLAT\u201d) Network Systems (both collectively, the PASSUR Network\u201d). During the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, in light of the FAA's mandate for ADS-B equipage on aircrafts operating in most U.S. airspace, effective January 2020, and parallel adoption of ADS-B requirements in much of the world, the Company performed a comprehensive review of its data feeds, specifically those associated with the PASSUR Network units, and external ADS-B data feeds to determine if these external data feeds provide sufficient redundant data as to that generated from the existing PASSUR installations. The Company determined that such services could be powered by a combination of FAA data plus commercial ADS-B aggregator feeds and other data feeds available to the Company, which would provide a more cost-effective solution and allow us to focus more on value-added analytics, and less on sensor technology. In this regard, the Company reviewed and decommissioned approximately half of its PASSUR Network system assets during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. As a result, during the year ended October 31, 2020, the Company wrote off the total remaining carrying value applicable to the PASSUR Network systems of approximately $3,565,000, and lease assets applicable to these PASSUR locations of approximately $175,000 during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, which amounts were included as an impairment charge for the year ended October 31, 2020. The write-off amount included PASSUR System and SMLAT System assets as well as inventory of finished and spare parts. The Company essentially completed the decommissioning process during fiscal year 2021.\nRevenues\nManagement concentrates its efforts on the sale of business intelligence, predictive analytics, and decision support product applications, utilizing data primarily derived from external sources and, to a lesser extent, the PASSUR Network (which is currently in the process of being decommissioned, as described above). Such efforts include the continued development of existing products, new product offerings and to a lesser extent, professional services.\nThe Company is a supplier and partner to the air transportation industry. Many of the Company's customers have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak and the rapid decline in air travel. As a result, the Company experienced downturns in its revenues for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, as compared to revenues for fiscal year 2019. See Risk Factors.\u201d\nAlthough the Company's revenue is primarily subscription based, during fiscal 2020, several customers requested, and the Company agreed to, the suspension of certain services to those customers, or the provision of services free of charge during a specific period of time. Additionally, one customer requested extended terms of payment, which request the Company also accepted. The Company believes that these decisions were in the best interests of the Company as a partner to the aviation industry and will benefit the Company in the longer term. The Company continues to believe that its products and professional service engagements are critical to the efficient operation of the air transportation market.\nIn fiscal year 2021, total revenues decreased $5.4 million, or 47%, to $6,157,000, as compared to $11,529,000 in fiscal year 2020. The decrease in total revenues was primarily due to a decrease in subscription revenue of $5.2 million or 47%, and a decrease in consulting and other revenue of $186,000 to $407,000, as compared to fiscal year 2020.\nThe decrease in subscription revenue of $5.2 million was primarily due to several expiring airline and airport contracts that were not renewed, which were offset in part by new contracts for subscription services closed during fiscal year 2021 and net incremental revenue recognized during both periods in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 related to new contracts closed during fiscal year 2020.\nThe Company was engaged in ongoing discussions with two of its customers about the possible renewal of certain existing contracts which had expired at various times from January 31, 2020 through May 31, 2020, but certain parts of these contracts had been renewed on a short-term interim basis. These contracts were not renewed in full or in part, which resulted in the loss of potential revenue generated from these contracts of approximately $2,322,000 for fiscal 2020. Additionally, the Company agreed with one of its customers to a temporary suspension of billings during the period from August 1, 2020 through October 31, 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This reduced the Company's fiscal 2020 revenue by approximately $513,000.\nThe decrease in consulting and other revenue of $186,000 to $407,000 for the year ended October 31, 2021, as compared to $593,000 for the same period in 2020, was due to several new professional service agreements entered into in fiscal 2020 that did not recur in fiscal 2021.\nThe Company continues to enhance its wide selection of products by developing and deploying new software applications and solutions to better address customers' needs, all of which are easily deliverable through web-based applications or as stand-alone professional services.\nCost of Revenues\nCosts associated with subscription and maintenance revenues consist primarily of direct labor, amortization of previously capitalized software development costs, communication costs, data feeds, travel and entertainment, and consulting fees. Previously, cost of revenues in each reporting period was impacted by capitalized costs associated with software development and data center projects, costs associated with upgrades to PASSUR and SMLAT Systems necessary to make such systems compatible with new software applications (all referred to as Capitalized Assets\u201d), depreciation of PASSUR and SMLAT Systems as well as the ordinary repair and maintenance of existing PASSUR and SMLAT Systems. Additionally, cost of revenues in each previous reporting period was impacted by the number of PASSUR and SMLAT System units added to the PASSUR Network, which included the production, shipment, and installation of these assets (largely installed by unaffiliated outside contractors), which had previously been capitalized to the PASSUR Network. In this regard, the Company reviewed and decommissioned approximately half of its PASSUR Network system assets during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The total balance attributable to the PASSUR Network was written off as of April 30, 2020, as described in more detail below. The Company essentially completed the decommissioning process during fiscal year 2021. In prior periods, the labor and fringe benefit costs of the Company employees involved in creating Capitalized Assets were capitalized, rather than expensed, and amortized over three years, as determined by their projected useful life. The Company did not capitalize any software development costs, as well as related network and data center costs, subsequent to January 31, 2020. Given business conditions in the aviation industry surrounding the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, the Company's software efforts were concentrated in the areas of maintenance of existing products.\nAs a result of the industry changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (described in Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic,\u201d above), the corresponding review conducted by the Company and the resultant write-offs taken during fiscal 2020, the Company anticipates that its level of capitalized software development costs, including related amortization of such costs, will continue to decrease in the future.\nCost of revenues decreased $3,900,000, or 63%, to $2,277,000 for the year ended October 31, 2021, as compared to $6,187,000 in fiscal year 2020. During fiscal year 2021, cost of revenues decreased as a result of decreases in personnel costs as well as reductions in depreciation and amortization expense and consulting costs, which were offset in part by a decrease in capitalized software development costs as a result of the Company not incurring any capitalized software costs subsequent to January 31, 2020. In response to the uncertainty surrounding the prospects of airlines and airports and the travel industry that began in fiscal year 2020 due to the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic (which uncertainty has continued), during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company undertook a review of its operating costs to more closely align those costs with its forecast for revenue. Prior to receiving CARES Act financing, the Company realized cost savings during fiscal 2020 from reductions in force, furloughs and temporary reductions in salaries, combined with the continued reduction in the use of outside development consultants. Also, as part of this review, the Company exited three leased facilities and terminated the related lease agreements. For the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company was able to use grants under the CARES Act and the Rescue Act to offset its compensation expense in cost of revenues by $1,995,000 and $473,000, respectively. Without the grants under the CARES Act and Rescue Act, Cost of revenues would have been $4,272,000 and $6,660,000 for the years ending October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Risk Factors.\u201d\nCosts of revenues was 37% of revenue in fiscal year 2021 compared with 54% in fiscal year 2020.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company's research and development efforts include activities associated with new product development, as well as the enhancement and improvement of the Company's existing software, and information products.\nResearch and development expenses decreased $131,000, or 39%, to $207,000 for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $338,000 for fiscal year 2020. The decrease in research and development was primarily attributable to a decrease in personnel related costs as compared to the prior year, as a result of the reductions in force and salary reduction programs discussed earlier. For the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company was able to use grants under the CARES Act and the Rescue Act to offset its research and development compensation expense by $127,000 and $16,000, respectively. Without the grants under the CARES Act and Rescue Act, Research and Development expenses would have been $334,000 and $354,000 for the years ending October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Risk Factors.\u201d\nThe Company anticipates that it will continue to invest in its software portfolio to develop, maintain, and support existing and newly developed applications for its customers. There were no customer-sponsored research and development activities during fiscal years 2021 and 2020. Research and development expenses are funded by current operations.\nSelling, General, and Administrative\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $3,947,000, or 61%, to $2,520,000 for the year ended October 31, 2021, as compared to $6,467,000 in the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in personnel related costs, professional and other consulting expenses, marketing and travel costs. These decreases were the result of the Company's concerted efforts to streamline its operations in line with the reduced level of revenue due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (as described above). For the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company was able to use proceeds from the PSP grants of the CARES Act and the Rescue Act to offset its compensation expense within selling, general and administrative expense by $2,456,000 and $641,000, respectively. Without the grants under the CARES Act and Rescue Act, Selling, general, and administrative expenses would have been $4,976,000 and $7,108,000 for the years ending October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Risk Factors.\u201d Also, as part of the review of its operating costs described above, the Company exited three leased facilities (during June and July 2020) and terminated the related lease agreements and reduced the leased square footage at another location. Annualized rent savings related to these undertakings represent approximately $311,000.\nImpairment Charges\nCertain of PASSUR's services traditionally relied on our proprietary network of sensors for aircraft surveillance. During the second quarter of 2020, in light of the FAA's mandate for ADS-B equipage on aircrafts operating in most U.S. airspace, effective January 2020, and parallel adoption of ADS-B requirements in much of the world, the Company performed a comprehensive review of its data feeds, specifically those associated with the PASSUR Network units and external ADS-B data feeds to determine if these external data feeds provide sufficient redundant data as to that generated from the existing PASSUR installations. The Company determined that such services could be powered by a combination of FAA data plus commercial ADS-B aggregator feeds and other date feeds available to the Company, which would provide a more cost-effective solution and allow the Company to focus more on value-added analytics and less on sensor technology. In this regard, the Company reviewed and decommissioned approximately half of the PASSUR Network system assets during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. As a result, the Company wrote off net assets applicable to the total book value of the PASSUR Network systems of approximately $3,565,000, and lease assets applicable to these PASSUR locations of approximately $175,000 during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, which amounts were included in the impairment charge for the year ended October 31, 2020. The write-off amount included PASSUR System and SMLAT System assets as well as inventory of finished and spare parts. The Company essentially completed the decommissioning process during fiscal year 2021.\nAs a result of the FAA mandate and the corresponding review conducted by the Company, which resulted in the commencement of the decommissioning of the PASSUR Network during fiscal year 2020, the Company anticipates that the costs of maintaining and operating these systems, including depreciation and related data feed costs, will decrease materially in the future.\nAdditionally, during the second quarter of 2020, given the impact of the current COVID-19 environment on customers, there was a sufficient amount of uncertainty surrounding the ability of customers to continue to perform their contracts with the Company and the Company's ability to generate revenue from such contracts. In order to determine whether or not an impairment had occurred, we looked at existing contracted revenue, adjusted for future uncertainties, and compared those amounts with the net carrying value of the related software development asset. Where the revenue amount was less than the net carrying value of the software development asset, we noted an impairment. As a result of this exercise, the Company wrote off previously capitalized software development costs totaling approximately $6,134,000 during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 due to impairment, given the impact of the current COVID-19 environment on the aviation industry and its customers, which amount was included in the impairment charge for the year ended October 31, 2020.\nThe Company did not capitalize any software development costs for any periods subsequent to January 31, 2020. As a result of the industry changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the corresponding review conducted by the Company during the second quarter of 2020 and the resultant write-offs, the Company anticipates that its level of capitalized software development, along with related amortization of such costs, will continue to decrease materially in the future.\nThe total amount of these charges and write-offs are included as an impairment charge for the year ended October 31, 2020 in the amount of $9,874,000.\nIncome/(Loss) from Operations\nIncome from operations for the year ended October 31, 2021 was $1,153,000, an increase of $12,490,000, or 110%, as compared to a loss from operations of $11,338,000 for the year ended October 31, 2020 (inclusive of the impact of the impairment charges recorded during the second quarter of 2020). Excluding the impact of the impairment charges of $9,874,000 in fiscal 2020, income from operations in fiscal 2021 improved by $2,616,000, or 179%, from a loss of $1,463,000 for the year ended October 31, 2020. The improvement in income from operations (excluding the impairment charges) was primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses of $7,988,000, or 62%, as compared to fiscal year 2020, which was partially offset by a decrease in revenue of $5,371,000,", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nResults of Operations\nGeneral\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities based upon accounting policies management has implemented. The Company has identified the policies and estimates below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the Company's business operations are discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, where such policies affect its reported financial results. The actual impact of these factors may differ under different assumptions or conditions.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nDuring the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, the aviation and travel industries, which are served by the Company and its products, were severely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Travel restrictions and other measures imposed by most jurisdictions, coupled with the public's reluctance to travel during this time, resulted in a precipitous decline in demand for air travel, and our customers in the aviation and travel industries drastically reduced their capacity and operations from 2020 into 2021 as compared to 2019, which in turn has resulted in a significant reduction of demand for our products and services. As a result, the Company has faced increased economic pressures and experienced a significant loss of revenue during the two-year period ended October 31, 2021. The Company anticipates a return to an improved economic environment in fiscal 2022 given the state of vaccinations, treatments available, and changes in public behaviors. The recovery, however, depends on many factors, the outcomes of which are uncertain or unknown at this time, such as, among other things, the scope, severity and duration of any variants to the COVID-19 virus, the continuing actions to contain the pandemic or to mitigate its impact, the acceptance and public distribution of treatments and vaccines for the disease (including its variants), and the length of time before the public feels safe to travel. All of these variables will impact how quickly the industry can recover and may affect the revenue and earnings levels of the Company. See Risk Factors\u201d.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d), enacted in March 2020, as well as subsequently enacted legislation, including the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the Rescue Act\u201d), have provided economic support for, among others, businesses in the airline industry. The Company has received grants under both the CARES Act and the Rescue Act (collectively referred to herein as CARES Act grants\u201d), totaling approximately $6,498,000, as described in more detail below.\n1.In July 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury to receive an aggregate of $3,003,000 in emergency relief through the CARES Act Payroll Support Program ( PSP1\u201d). The relief payments were received in three installments from July 2020 through September 2020. Pursuant to the Payroll Support Program Agreement, the relief payments must be used exclusively for the continuation of payment of certain employee wages, salaries and benefits. The Company has used such relief payments for such purpose. The Payroll Support Program Agreement provides that the relief payments are conditioned on the Company's agreement to, among other things, refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs through September 30, 2020, as well as other conditions including prohibitions on share repurchases and dividends through September 30, 2021, and certain limitations on executive compensation.\n2.On February 12, 2021, the Company received an additional top off\u201d disbursement of $875,000 under PSP1, subject to the terms and conditions described above.\n3.On March 5, 2021, the Company entered into a Payroll Support Program Extension Agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury for an award the Company received under the CARES Act Payroll Support Program ( PSP2\u201d). The total amount awarded to the Company under PSP2 was approximately $1,310,000. The relief payments under PSP2 were received in two installments of approximately $655,000 each on March 8, 2021 and April 26, 2021. As with the original grant under PSP1, PSP2 proceeds are to be used exclusively for the continuation of payment of certain employee wages, salaries, and benefits. The Company has used such relief payments for such purpose. The Payroll Support Program Extension Agreement for PSP2 provides that the relief payments are conditioned on the Company's agreement to, among other things, refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs through the later of March 31, 2021, or the date on which the Company has expended all of the payroll support, as well as other conditions including prohibitions on share repurchases and dividends through March 31, 2022, and certain limitations on executive compensation.\n4.On April 16, 2021, the Company entered into a Payroll Support Program 3 Agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury for an award the Company received under the Rescue Act (PSP3\u201d). The total amount awarded to the Company under PSP3 was approximately $1,310,000. The first installment, in the amount of approximately $655,000, was received by the Company on April 29, 2021. The second installment of approximately $655,000 was received by the Company on May 27, 2021. The Company does not anticipate any additional stimulus grant payments under the Payroll Support Programs. As with the original\ngrants under PSP1 and PSP2, proceeds under PSP3 are to be used exclusively for the continuation of payment of certain employee wages, salaries, and benefits. The Company has used such proceeds for such purpose. The Payroll Support Program 3 Agreement provides that the relief payments are conditioned on the Company's agreement to, among other things, refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs through the later of September 30, 2021, or the date on which the Company has expended all of the payroll support under PSP3, as well as other conditions including prohibitions on share repurchases and dividends through September 30, 2022, and certain limitations on executive compensation. The amount of unused stimulus funding as of October 31 2021 and 2020 was $856,000 and $1,934,000 (exclusive of $3,495,000 in grants received after October 31, 2020), respectively, and is shown in the balance sheet under current liabilities as Accrued Liabilities - Stimulus Funding.\nThe Company believes that it has operated in compliance with all the provisions and requirements under the CARES Act and the Rescue Act during the two-year period ended October 31, 2021 and fully intends to continue to comply with all such provisions and requirements. Consequently, the Company has accounted for the advanced funds as grants not requiring repayment and recognized such amounts in income as qualifying salaries, wages and benefits have been incurred. During the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company reduced its compensation expense by $4,578,000 and $1,130,000, respectively, as the CARES Act grant proceeds received by the Company were used to fund eligible payroll costs. If the Company does not comply with the provisions of the CARES Act, the Rescue Act and the Payroll Support Program Agreements, the Company may be required to repay the government funds and also be subject to other remedies.\nAdditionally, provisions under the CARES Act allow the Company to defer payment of the employer's share of social security taxes incurred from March of 2020 through December 31, 2020. The amount of payroll taxes subject to deferred payment is approximately $139,000. Under the terms of the legislation, 50% of the deferred payroll taxes were due and paid by December 31, 2021, and the remaining 50% are due and payable by December 31, 2022.\nThe Company has taken several actions beginning in April 2020 and prior to receiving CARES Act funds, to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business, as outlined below:\n\u00b7Eliminated or furloughed approximately one-third of then-existing positions (all furloughed employees were offered an opportunity to return, subsequent to the Company receiving the CARES Act funds);\n\u00b7Instituted a temporary pay reduction plan affecting essentially all of the then-remaining employees;\n\u00b7Reduced the use of outside consultants;\n\u00b7Decommissioned the PASSUR Network to reduce data feed and telecom costs; and\n\u00b7Reduced and/or eliminated other operating expenses that were not critical to the short-term outlook of the Company.\nThe effects of the actions above were reflected in lower costs of revenues, research and development and administrative costs in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, compared to fiscal 2019, and the Company anticipates that such cost savings will continue into fiscal 2022. However, if the recovery of the air transportation industry accelerates and revenue levels quickly return to pre-COVID-19 levels, these levels of cost savings may not be practicable or sustainable to support the operations necessary for the increased level of revenue. See Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nPASSUR is a global leader in digital operational excellence. The Company's trusted platform, combined with professional services, helps customers reduce operational complexity and lower operating expenses.\nOperational efficiency is more important now than ever to eliminate sources of waste, variability, and inflexibility in operations. The Company addresses these significant industry problems by using our technology platform, combined with professional services, to provide solutions that predict, prioritize, prevent and help the industry recover from unexpected disruptions. These disruptions have long been seen as the cost of doing business in the industry and are even more pronounced today and create greater uncertainty to the industry. The Company provides actionable intelligence to enable the industry to manage their operations more efficiently and increase profits.\nThe Company provides its solutions to airlines and airports in the U.S., as well as an airline in Latin America. The global market presents an opportunity to network more customers in a broader market.\nOur core business addresses some of the aviation industry's most intractable and costly challenges, including, but not limited to, underutilization of airspace and airport capacity, delays, cancellations, and diversions. Several independent studies have estimated the annual direct costs of such inefficiencies to airlines in the United States at over $8 billion annually and worldwide direct cost at over $30 billion annually.\nSolutions offered by PASSUR help to ensure flight completion. They cover the entire flight life cycle, from gate to gate, and result in reductions in overall costs and carbon emissions, while maximizing revenue opportunities, improving operational efficiency, and enhancing the passenger experience.\nThe Company's revenues are generated by selling: (1) subscription-based real-time decision and information solutions; and (2) professional services.\nThe Company's major achievements during fiscal year 2021 are summarized below:\nDespite the ongoing difficulties that the COVID-19 pandemic presented for the aviation industry, PASSUR was able to secure 19 new contracts with a mix of new customers and existing customers with incremental revenue and renew 42 of 48 contracts, with the six losses directly attributed to reduced flight volumes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2021, PASSUR:\n\u00b7Launched a new data service (ARiVADATA ) in August, 2021, leading to several new customer wins\n\u00b7Continued to enhance the ARiVATM platform, aligned to revenue and market opportunities\n\u00b7Began the process of migrating from our co-location infrastructure to a cloud based, secure, resilient, and scalable platform\n\u00b7Integrated an additional 25,000 terrestrial ADS-B sensors, completed the integration of Aireon satellite surface and in-flight data feeds\n\u00b7Enhanced the value of the ARiVATM platform through improvements in implementation of machine learning capabilities and enhanced algorithms\nKey 2021 Developments\nIntroduction of the ARiVADATA Data Service\nARiVADATA is one of the market leading aviation data solutions, designed to reduce operating costs by providing predictive and real-time insights into complex aviation operations, delivered through an application program interface (API). Some features include:\n\u00b7Global predictive aircraft situational awareness through machine learning\n\u00b7Real time operations control (airborne operations and airfield operations)\n\u00b7Gate-to-gate surface and airborne tracking on a single platform\n\u00b7Compliance with the ICAO GADSS mandate (described below)\n\u00b7Traffic analysis\n\u00b7Statistical reporting\nAs of January 1, 2023, the ICAO GADSS mandate requires aircraft to be continuously tracked anywhere in the globe, including over water, mountains, and other uncontrolled airspace, with a minimum update rate of 15 minutes - switching to updates every one (1) minute under distress conditions.\u201d\nIn 2021, PASSUR was able to create the ARiVA Global Feed (AGF), which fuses over 44 data feeds, including from multiple government, ANSP, and commercial surveillance sources. AGF consolidates in one feed all of the data required by operators and aviation software support companies to maintain GADSS aircraft tracking compliance.\nNew Customer Wins and Renewals\nDuring 2021, despite the ongoing difficulties that the COVID-19 pandemic presented for the aviation industry, in a testament to our ability to meet customer needs and continue to assist them in achieving meaningful operational savings, PASSUR was able to secure 19 new contract wins, through a mix of new customers and existing customers with incremental revenue, on our new ARiVATM platform, while at the same time renewing and migrating 42 customer contracts, from our legacy services to the ARiVATM platform. New wins and renewals crossed all customer segments, including Airports, Airlines as well as FBOs.\nExpansion of the PASSUR Partnership Footprint\nPASSUR has now taken what we believe to be a market leading position in terms of our global ADS-B coverage through the addition of the AirNav Systems ADS-B network into our satellite and existing extensive terrestrial ADS-B coverage.\nMigration of the ARiVATM Platform to Cloud-Based Computing\nIn 2020, PASSUR took the opportunity to migrate away from a hardware-based data collection platform and become an aggregator of global data. In 2021, PASSUR started a similar journey to migrate from our legacy, hardware-based co-location infrastructure platform, to a cloud-based platform. Starting with development instances, the Company believes that it is poised to successfully transition all of our key products to the cloud by the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. We believe this will aid PASSUR in achieving greater security, resiliency, and cost performance, in addition to positioning us for scalable growth moving forward.\nSetting the Stage for Global Expansion\nIn the past, PASSUR revenue growth was challenged due to dependencies on its proprietary hardware network, deployed at specific locations, mainly within the continental United States. Over the last 18 months, PASSUR has gone through a major evolution to become a next-generation SaaS company and has focused on sourcing and aggregating global data feeds (satellite as well as terrestrial), as well as additional data or information required to enhance the ARiVATM platform's effectiveness. As part of this evolution, PASSUR substantially enhanced our platform capabilities to enable new and existing services to be delivered across all customer segments on a global basis. These enhancements include improvements to our artificial intelligence/machine learning engine, visualization, alerting, and collaborative decision-making capabilities.\nBy delivering these enhancements in 2021, PASSUR believes, subject to the factors described under Risk Factors\u201d, that it is now optimally positioned to service all stakeholders within the aviation industry on a global basis.\nPASSUR Network\nCertain of PASSUR's services traditionally relied on our proprietary network of sensors for aircraft surveillance - the PASSUR and Surface Multilateration ( SMLAT\u201d) Network Systems (both collectively, the PASSUR Network\u201d). During the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, in light of the FAA's mandate for ADS-B equipage on aircrafts operating in most U.S. airspace, effective January 2020, and parallel adoption of ADS-B requirements in much of the world, the Company performed a comprehensive review of its data feeds, specifically those associated with the PASSUR Network units, and external ADS-B data feeds to determine if these external data feeds provide sufficient redundant data as to that generated from the existing PASSUR installations. The Company determined that such services could be powered by a combination of FAA data plus commercial ADS-B aggregator feeds and other data feeds available to the Company, which would provide a more cost-effective solution and allow us to focus more on value-added analytics, and less on sensor technology. In this regard, the Company reviewed and decommissioned approximately half of its PASSUR Network system assets during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. As a result, during the year ended October 31, 2020, the Company wrote off the total remaining carrying value applicable to the PASSUR Network systems of approximately $3,565,000, and lease assets applicable to these PASSUR locations of approximately $175,000 during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, which amounts were included as an impairment charge for the year ended October 31, 2020. The write-off amount included PASSUR System and SMLAT System assets as well as inventory of finished and spare parts. The Company essentially completed the decommissioning process during fiscal year 2021.\nRevenues\nManagement concentrates its efforts on the sale of business intelligence, predictive analytics, and decision support product applications, utilizing data primarily derived from external sources and, to a lesser extent, the PASSUR Network (which is currently in the process of being decommissioned, as described above). Such efforts include the continued development of existing products, new product offerings and to a lesser extent, professional services.\nThe Company is a supplier and partner to the air transportation industry. Many of the Company's customers have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak and the rapid decline in air travel. As a result, the Company experienced downturns in its revenues for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, as compared to revenues for fiscal year 2019. See Risk Factors.\u201d\nAlthough the Company's revenue is primarily subscription based, during fiscal 2020, several customers requested, and the Company agreed to, the suspension of certain services to those customers, or the provision of services free of charge during a specific period of time. Additionally, one customer requested extended terms of payment, which request the Company also accepted. The Company believes that these decisions were in the best interests of the Company as a partner to the aviation industry and will benefit the Company in the longer term. The Company continues to believe that its products and professional service engagements are critical to the efficient operation of the air transportation market.\nIn fiscal year 2021, total revenues decreased $5.4 million, or 47%, to $6,157,000, as compared to $11,529,000 in fiscal year 2020. The decrease in total revenues was primarily due to a decrease in subscription revenue of $5.2 million or 47%, and a decrease in consulting and other revenue of $186,000 to $407,000, as compared to fiscal year 2020.\nThe decrease in subscription revenue of $5.2 million was primarily due to several expiring airline and airport contracts that were not renewed, which were offset in part by new contracts for subscription services closed during fiscal year 2021 and net incremental revenue recognized during both periods in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 related to new contracts closed during fiscal year 2020.\nThe Company was engaged in ongoing discussions with two of its customers about the possible renewal of certain existing contracts which had expired at various times from January 31, 2020 through May 31, 2020, but certain parts of these contracts had been renewed on a short-term interim basis. These contracts were not renewed in full or in part, which resulted in the loss of potential revenue generated from these contracts of approximately $2,322,000 for fiscal 2020. Additionally, the Company agreed with one of its customers to a temporary suspension of billings during the period from August 1, 2020 through October 31, 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This reduced the Company's fiscal 2020 revenue by approximately $513,000.\nThe decrease in consulting and other revenue of $186,000 to $407,000 for the year ended October 31, 2021, as compared to $593,000 for the same period in 2020, was due to several new professional service agreements entered into in fiscal 2020 that did not recur in fiscal 2021.\nThe Company continues to enhance its wide selection of products by developing and deploying new software applications and solutions to better address customers' needs, all of which are easily deliverable through web-based applications or as stand-alone professional services.\nCost of Revenues\nCosts associated with subscription and maintenance revenues consist primarily of direct labor, amortization of previously capitalized software development costs, communication costs, data feeds, travel and entertainment, and consulting fees. Previously, cost of revenues in each reporting period was impacted by capitalized costs associated with software development and data center projects, costs associated with upgrades to PASSUR and SMLAT Systems necessary to make such systems compatible with new software applications (all referred to as Capitalized Assets\u201d), depreciation of PASSUR and SMLAT Systems as well as the ordinary repair and maintenance of existing PASSUR and SMLAT Systems. Additionally, cost of revenues in each previous reporting period was impacted by the number of PASSUR and SMLAT System units added to the PASSUR Network, which included the production, shipment, and installation of these assets (largely installed by unaffiliated outside contractors), which had previously been capitalized to the PASSUR Network. In this regard, the Company reviewed and decommissioned approximately half of its PASSUR Network system assets during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The total balance attributable to the PASSUR Network was written off as of April 30, 2020, as described in more detail below. The Company essentially completed the decommissioning process during fiscal year 2021. In prior periods, the labor and fringe benefit costs of the Company employees involved in creating Capitalized Assets were capitalized, rather than expensed, and amortized over three years, as determined by their projected useful life. The Company did not capitalize any software development costs, as well as related network and data center costs, subsequent to January 31, 2020. Given business conditions in the aviation industry surrounding the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, the Company's software efforts were concentrated in the areas of maintenance of existing products.\nAs a result of the industry changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (described in Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic,\u201d above), the corresponding review conducted by the Company and the resultant write-offs taken during fiscal 2020, the Company anticipates that its level of capitalized software development costs, including related amortization of such costs, will continue to decrease in the future.\nCost of revenues decreased $3,900,000, or 63%, to $2,277,000 for the year ended October 31, 2021, as compared to $6,187,000 in fiscal year 2020. During fiscal year 2021, cost of revenues decreased as a result of decreases in personnel costs as well as reductions in depreciation and amortization expense and consulting costs, which were offset in part by a decrease in capitalized software development costs as a result of the Company not incurring any capitalized software costs subsequent to January 31, 2020. In response to the uncertainty surrounding the prospects of airlines and airports and the travel industry that began in fiscal year 2020 due to the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic (which uncertainty has continued), during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company undertook a review of its operating costs to more closely align those costs with its forecast for revenue. Prior to receiving CARES Act financing, the Company realized cost savings during fiscal 2020 from reductions in force, furloughs and temporary reductions in salaries, combined with the continued reduction in the use of outside development consultants. Also, as part of this review, the Company exited three leased facilities and terminated the related lease agreements. For the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company was able to use grants under the CARES Act and the Rescue Act to offset its compensation expense in cost of revenues by $1,995,000 and $473,000, respectively. Without the grants under the CARES Act and Rescue Act, Cost of revenues would have been $4,272,000 and $6,660,000 for the years ending October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Risk Factors.\u201d\nCosts of revenues was 37% of revenue in fiscal year 2021 compared with 54% in fiscal year 2020.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company's research and development efforts include activities associated with new product development, as well as the enhancement and improvement of the Company's existing software, and information products.\nResearch and development expenses decreased $131,000, or 39%, to $207,000 for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $338,000 for fiscal year 2020. The decrease in research and development was primarily attributable to a decrease in personnel related costs as compared to the prior year, as a result of the reductions in force and salary reduction programs discussed earlier. For the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company was able to use grants under the CARES Act and the Rescue Act to offset its research and development compensation expense by $127,000 and $16,000, respectively. Without the grants under the CARES Act and Rescue Act, Research and Development expenses would have been $334,000 and $354,000 for the years ending October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Risk Factors.\u201d\nThe Company anticipates that it will continue to invest in its software portfolio to develop, maintain, and support existing and newly developed applications for its customers. There were no customer-sponsored research and development activities during fiscal years 2021 and 2020. Research and development expenses are funded by current operations.\nSelling, General, and Administrative\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $3,947,000, or 61%, to $2,520,000 for the year ended October 31, 2021, as compared to $6,467,000 in the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in personnel related costs, professional and other consulting expenses, marketing and travel costs. These decreases were the result of the Company's concerted efforts to streamline its operations in line with the reduced level of revenue due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (as described above). For the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company was able to use proceeds from the PSP grants of the CARES Act and the Rescue Act to offset its compensation expense within selling, general and administrative expense by $2,456,000 and $641,000, respectively. Without the grants under the CARES Act and Rescue Act, Selling, general, and administrative expenses would have been $4,976,000 and $7,108,000 for the years ending October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Risk Factors.\u201d Also, as part of the review of its operating costs described above, the Company exited three leased facilities (during June and July 2020) and terminated the related lease agreements and reduced the leased square footage at another location. Annualized rent savings related to these undertakings represent approximately $311,000.\nImpairment Charges\nCertain of PASSUR's services traditionally relied on our proprietary network of sensors for aircraft surveillance. During the second quarter of 2020, in light of the FAA's mandate for ADS-B equipage on aircrafts operating in most U.S. airspace, effective January 2020, and parallel adoption of ADS-B requirements in much of the world, the Company performed a comprehensive review of its data feeds, specifically those associated with the PASSUR Network units and external ADS-B data feeds to determine if these external data feeds provide sufficient redundant data as to that generated from the existing PASSUR installations. The Company determined that such services could be powered by a combination of FAA data plus commercial ADS-B aggregator feeds and other date feeds available to the Company, which would provide a more cost-effective solution and allow the Company to focus more on value-added analytics and less on sensor technology. In this regard, the Company reviewed and decommissioned approximately half of the PASSUR Network system assets during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. As a result, the Company wrote off net assets applicable to the total book value of the PASSUR Network systems of approximately $3,565,000, and lease assets applicable to these PASSUR locations of approximately $175,000 during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, which amounts were included in the impairment charge for the year ended October 31, 2020. The write-off amount included PASSUR System and SMLAT System assets as well as inventory of finished and spare parts. The Company essentially completed the decommissioning process during fiscal year 2021.\nAs a result of the FAA mandate and the corresponding review conducted by the Company, which resulted in the commencement of the decommissioning of the PASSUR Network during fiscal year 2020, the Company anticipates that the costs of maintaining and operating these systems, including depreciation and related data feed costs, will decrease materially in the future.\nAdditionally, during the second quarter of 2020, given the impact of the current COVID-19 environment on customers, there was a sufficient amount of uncertainty surrounding the ability of customers to continue to perform their contracts with the Company and the Company's ability to generate revenue from such contracts. In order to determine whether or not an impairment had occurred, we looked at existing contracted revenue, adjusted for future uncertainties, and compared those amounts with the net carrying value of the related software development asset. Where the revenue amount was less than the net carrying value of the software development asset, we noted an impairment. As a result of this exercise, the Company wrote off previously capitalized software development costs totaling approximately $6,134,000 during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 due to impairment, given the impact of the current COVID-19 environment on the aviation industry and its customers, which amount was included in the impairment charge for the year ended October 31, 2020.\nThe Company did not capitalize any software development costs for any periods subsequent to January 31, 2020. As a result of the industry changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the corresponding review conducted by the Company during the second quarter of 2020 and the resultant write-offs, the Company anticipates that its level of capitalized software development, along with related amortization of such costs, will continue to decrease materially in the future.\nThe total amount of these charges and write-offs are included as an impairment charge for the year ended October 31, 2020 in the amount of $9,874,000.\nIncome/(Loss) from Operations\nIncome from operations for the year ended October 31, 2021 was $1,153,000, an increase of $12,490,000, or 110%, as compared to a loss from operations of $11,338,000 for the year ended October 31, 2020 (inclusive of the impact of the impairment charges recorded during the second quarter of 2020). Excluding the impact of the impairment charges of $9,874,000 in fiscal 2020, income from operations in fiscal 2021 improved by $2,616,000, or 179%, from a loss of $1,463,000 for the year ended October 31, 2020. The improvement in income from operations (excluding the impairment charges) was primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses of $7,988,000, or 62%, as compared to fiscal year 2020, which was partially offset by a decrease in revenue of $5,371,000,"}
