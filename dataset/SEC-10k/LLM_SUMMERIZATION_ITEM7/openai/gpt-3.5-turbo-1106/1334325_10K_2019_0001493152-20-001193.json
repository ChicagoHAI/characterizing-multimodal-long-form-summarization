MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe information herein contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact made herein are forward looking. In particular, the statements herein regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d could,\u201d possibly,\u201d probably,\u201d anticipates,\u201d projects,\u201d expects,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d or should\u201d or other variations or similar words. No assurances can be given that the future results anticipated by the forward-looking statements will be achieved. Forward-looking statements reflect management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ significantly from management's expectations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, included herewith. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment of our management.\nGeneral Overview\nWe operate two distinct business operations. These are:\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Marine Technology Business ( also referred to as Products Segment\u201d); and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Marine Engineering Business ( also referred to as Services Segment\u201d). </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Marine Technology Business is a technology solution provider to the subsea market. It has a long-established pedigree in this market, and it designs, develops and manufactures proprietary solutions for this market (both for commercial and defense applications) including our range of flagship volumetric real time sonar solutions.\nThese solutions/products are used primarily in the underwater construction market, offshore oil and gas, offshore wind energy industry, and in the complex dredging, port security, mining and marine sciences sectors. Our customers include service providers to major oil and gas ( O&G\u201d) companies, law enforcement agencies, ports, mining companies, defense bodies, research institutes and universities.\nOur Marine Engineering Business is a supplier of engineering services and embedded solutions (such as mission computers) to prime defense contractors such as Raytheon and Northrop Grumman. Generally, the items supplied into the defense market are sub-systems in broader mission critical integrated systems and thus requires a high level of reliability, consistency in standards and robustness.\nWe have long-standing relationships with prime defense contractors, and we use these credentials to secure more business. We support some significant defense programs by supplying and maintaining proprietary parts (or parts for which we are preferred suppliers) through obsolescence management programs. These services provide recurring stream of revenues for our Services segment.\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBoth Business Operations have established synergies in terms of customers and specialized engineering skill sets encompassing capturing, computing and displaying data in harsh environments.\nOur business is affected by a number of factors including those set out below:\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>A. </td> <td>United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union ( Brexit\u201d) including the possibility that such withdrawal will take place without a deal on their future relationship ( No Deal Brexit Issue\u201d) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFollowing a national referendum and the recent elections in the United Kingdom which saw a majority Government, a bill has now been passed for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union on January 31, 2020. A transitional period of 12 months is expected. During the transitional period, the United Kingdom Government and the European Union will negotiate its future trade relationship. If no agreement is reached, the UK Government which now has a majority for its actions, has stated that it will leave the European Union without a deal on its future relationship,\nA No Deal Brexit could affect our UK operations which represents a significant part of our earnings (Coda Octopus Products Limited (Edinburgh-based) and Coda Octopus Martech Limited (Portland, England-based).\nThe ongoing uncertainty also impacts the British Pound (which is the trading currency of our UK operations). Although the appointment of a majority government on December 13, 2019 saw a surge in the UK Pound against all major currencies, it is expected that the ongoing uncertainty around the future relationship with the European Union will cause the UK Pound to continue to be volatile against major currencies, including the US Dollar. Since our reporting currency is the US Dollar, depreciation of the UK Pound has an adverse impact on revenues reported and devaluation of our consolidated balance sheet assets.\nBecause there is no precedent for a European Union member state leaving the Union, the full implications for the Company are not clear. The outcome is dependent on the type of future relationship that is struck between the United Kingdom and the European Union. In a worst-case scenario, where no deal on the future of the UK relationship with the European Union is struck, it is widely believed that the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules will apply. Operating on this basis would have far-reaching implications for our Company particularly in the area of costs associated with import/export arrangements for our products including custom duties on purchases and sales and delays and increased compliance costs in the supply chain (both purchasing and selling). We currently benefit from mutual recognition rules in a number of areas including export control requirements and quality standards which allow us to distribute our products freely in the European Union. If these are removed it is likely to involve new qualifications requirements that we would need to meet with the attendant costs and delays involved. Furthermore, if free movement is restricted this will also limit our ability to utilize our trained engineers and experts on customer projects in the European Union.\nThe Company continues to make plans to mitigate the departure from the European Union. The Company established a company, Coda Octopus Products A/S, in Denmark to maintain a presence in the European Union and to address some of the foreseeable issues. However, we can give no assurance that this in itself would be sufficient to address the impact of both a No Deal Brexit and a No Deal Brexit.\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>B. </td> <td>Currency Risks: </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's operations are split between the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Denmark. A large proportion of our revenues (approximately 48%) and costs are incurred outside of the USA with a significant part (46% of our total revenues) of that in the United Kingdom ( UK\u201d). In addition, a significant part of our assets (both current and fixed) are held in British Pounds by our foreign subsidiaries. Fiscal years 2017 through 2019 saw the weakening of the British Pound. The continued uncertainty around the future relationship with the European Union and the United Kingdom, is likely to see significant volatility in the British Pound against major currencies. The depreciation of the British Pound against major currencies adversely impacts our revenues as a whole which are reported in U.S. Dollars. Furthermore, a large part of our assets is held in British Pounds while the majority of our liabilities (which comprise our senior secured debentures are maintained in U.S. Dollars see Note 8 - Loans and Notes Payable - of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements October 31, 2019 and 2018). In fiscal year 2019 we incurred a gain on our exchange rate translations in respect of our comprehensive income and loss account. See Note 2, paragraph n, of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements October 31, 2019 and 2018 regarding our Foreign Currency Translation policy. Until a longer-term trade arrangement is agreed between the United Kingdom and the European Union, we expect to see continued volatility in the British Pounds. We currently do not hedge our currency risks. However, we continue to evaluate the prudency of hedging such risks.\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>C. </td> <td>Trade Disputes: </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe costs of our raw materials could become a serious concern due to inter-country trade disputes. Our US Services Segment has suffered increased cost of raw materials sourced within the United States due to ongoing trade dispute between the USA, China and Canada. Furthermore, with the ongoing trade dispute between the USA and China, the Products Segment has seen a decline of sales into China in the 2019 fiscal year.\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>D. </td> <td>Price of Commodities: </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe price of commodities, in particular oil and gas ( O&G\u201d). The decline in O&G prices since 2014 with a partial recovery since 2016 has resulted in large scale reductions in capital and operational expenditures and seismic changes in the subsea market. This directly impacts on the Products Segment by reducing the quantity of sales and rentals into O&G and related markets. O&G has remained very competitive and customers are increasingly seeking significant discounts to place orders. Around 7% of the Marine Technology Business revenues emanate from this sector. Historically, and prior to the price downturn, the vast majority of our revenues were generated from O&G sector.\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>E. </td> <td>Government Spending for Defense: </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe allocation of funds to defense procurement by governments in the United States and the United Kingdom. A large part of our revenues in the Services Segment emanates from government funding in the defense sector. In general, where there is a change of government, spending priorities change which may have an impact on our revenues.\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>F. </td> <td>Political Landscape: </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGlobal-political uncertainties affect the markets for our goods and services. For example, the current unrest in Hong Kong has resulted in significant shipments to China being delayed as we have seen an increased number of UK Customs Border Police detaining shipments to China. We anticipate that revenues will be affected if we are unable to meet our contractual obligations as a result of ship detentions.\nGlobal trends which make certain geographical regions more competitive in providing engineering solutions because of lower labor costs (e.g. India and China) are likely to affect our Services Segments.\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>G. </td> <td>Resourcing Levels </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBeing a small technology company, we are hindered in our ability to compete for certain specialized electronic engineering skills as our remuneration package is not as competitive as those offered by bigger companies.\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>H. </td> <td>Investments: </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe lack the financial resources to advance our flagship technology at the commercially appropriate pace required to capture new markets and increase our sales which could facilitate new entrants to the market. For example, Teledyne Technologies Incorporated, a multi-billion company, has recently acquired a number of subsea companies that may speed up their entry into our market.\nIn relative terms, the Company has limited external sources of capital available, and as such is reliant upon its ability to sell its products and services to provide sufficient working capital for its operations and obligations. Notwithstanding, on or around November 27, 2019 the Company secured a $4m Revolving Credit Line from HSBC NA, its current bankers which can be used for working capital including expansion activities as required.\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>I. </td> <td>Technological Advancement: </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA significant part of our growth strategy is predicated on our flagship real time volumetric imaging sonar technology. The technology space is inherently uncertain due to the fast pace of innovations and therefore we can give no assurance that we can maintain our leading position in the real time volumetric imaging sonar market or that innovations in other areas may not surpass our unique capability that we currently supply to subsea market. Some examples of new technology entering the subsea market is LIDAR technology. However, this technology cannot be employed in zero visibility conditions and cannot generate a volume pulse or image moving objects.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported levels of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nBelow is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results and that may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2, Summary of Accounting Policies\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nAll of our revenues are earned under formal contracts with our customers and are derived from both sales and rental of underwater technologies and equipment for imaging, mapping, defense and survey applications and from the engineering services that we provide. Our contracts do not include the possibility for additional contingent consideration so that our determination of the contract price does not involve having to consider potential variable additional consideration. Our product sales do not include a right of return by the customer.\nWith regard to our Products Segment, all of our products are sold on a stand-alone basis and those market prices are evidence of the value of the products. To the extent that we also provide services (e.g., installation, training, etc.), those services are either included as part of the product or are subject to written contracts based on the stand-alone value of those services. Revenue from the sale of services is recognized when those services have been provided to the customer and evidence of the provision of those services exist.\nFor further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policies, refer to Note 2 - Revenue Recognition\u201d in these financial statements\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nStock based Compensation\nWe recognize the expense related to the fair value of stock based compensation awards within the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. The stock based fair value compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the performance of the services is completed (measurement date) and is recognized over the periods in which the related services are rendered.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under ASC 740, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the income tax effects of differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their bases for income tax reporting. The Company's differences arise principally from the use of various accelerated and modified accelerated cost recovery system lives for income tax purposes versus straight line depreciation used for book purposes and from the utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are the amounts by which the Company's future income taxes are expected to be impacted by these differences as they reverse. Deferred tax assets are based on differences that are expected to decrease future income taxes as they reverse. Correspondingly, deferred tax liabilities are based on differences that are expected to increase future income taxes as they reverse. Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and also presents the impact of significant differences between financial reporting income and taxable income.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor income tax purposes, the Company uses the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues on long-term contracts which is consistent with the Company's financial reporting under U.S. GAAP.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist principally of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired (i.e. goodwill), customer relationships, non-compete agreements and licenses. Goodwill was allocated to our reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation. Goodwill is not amortized and is evaluated for impairment annually or more often if circumstances indicate impairment may exist. Customer relationships, non-compete agreements, patents and licenses are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of 2 to 15 years. The Company amortizes its limited lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists.\nThe first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its' carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value, which is based on future cash flows, exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the second step must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The Company will early adopt Accounting Standards Codification 2017 - 04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which permits the Company to impair the difference between carrying amount in excess of the fair value of the reporting unit as the reduction in goodwill. ASC 2017-04 eliminates the requirement in previous GAAP to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test.\nAt the end of each year, we evaluate goodwill on a separate reporting unit basis to assess recoverability, and impairments, if any, are recognized in earnings. An impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over the fair value of the reporting unit.\nFiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Results of Operations\nDuring the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019, the Marine Technology Business generated 52% of our consolidated revenues compared to 64% in the previous fiscal year and, similarly, the Marine Engineering Business generated 48% compared to 36% in the previous fiscal year respectively.\nOverall, consolidated revenues in the 2019 fiscal year were up by 39.1%; Gross Profit was up by 29.7%; Total Operating Expenses was up by 7.0%; Income from Operations was up by 94.1%; Net Income Before Taxes was up by 106.5%. There were no material exceptional costs or financial events in the 2019 fiscal year, except that in fiscal year 2019, we recorded a tax expense of $1,007,354 compared to a tax benefit of $1,754,169 in the 2018 fiscal year.\nIn the fiscal year 2019, R&D expenditures increased by 8.9% and SG&A by 8.8%. We believe we have reached the pinnacle of our investments in R&D in our 4th and 5th generations of our products and as such in 2020, we would expect to maintain R&D at approximately the same 2019 levels. The only exceptional expenses we anticipate will be in the investments we need to make to transition the production of the Navy Head Up Display (HUD) product production to the Orlando Office and incubating our embedded solutions division which we see as an investment in future growth of the Company. Under the terms of the exclusive license which is being negotiated with Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama Division to practice the invention pertaining to the HUD face plate, the Company must transfer such manufacturing within 12 months of grant of the exclusive license. We anticipate an investment of around $500,000 in the 2020 period to achieve the transfer. This investment will encompass (i) implementing the required security measures; (ii) recruiting and training personnel; and (iii) making our Orlando facilities (acquired in 2019) manufacturing ready.\nComparison of fiscal year ended October 31, 2019 ( 2019 Fiscal Year\u201d or 2019 FY\u201d) to fiscal year ended October 31, 2018 ( 2018 Fiscal Year\u201d or 2018 FY\u201d)\nThe information provided below pertains to the Company's consolidated financial results. For information on the performance of each Segment including the disaggregation of revenues and geographical split, see Note 12 of our audited Consolidated Financial Statements of October 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue:\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>25,056,934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,019,429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 39.1% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe realized a significant increase in revenues in the 2019 FY compared to the 2018 FY. This is because in the 2019 FY our Services Segment achieved its revenue plan unlike the 2018 FY where it experienced delay in securing anticipated annual defense contracts as a result in the delay in the adoption of the US Federal Defense Budget. In the 2019 FY the Services Segment received backlog orders and is now back on plan.\nDuring 2019 Fiscal Year, the Products Segment generated revenues of $12,908,110 and Services Segment $12,148,824. During the 2019 FY, the Products Segment revenues grew by 12.7% over the 2018 FY and the Services Segment revenues grew by 84.9% over the said period.\nDuring the 2019 FY, the Company had one customer from whom it generated sales greater than 10% of net revenues. Revenue from this customer was $6,764,199 or 27% of net revenues during the 2019 FY. Total accounts receivable from this customer at October 31, 2019 was $898,584 or 20% of accounts receivable.\nGross Margin:\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>65.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>70.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease of 4.8 percentage points </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(gross profit of $16,429,319) </td> <td> </td> <td>(gross profit of $12,662,362) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Margin is determined by the composition of our consolidated sales achieved in the reporting period. In general, the Gross Profit Margins are greater on the Products Segment sales than the Services Segment as the latter's margins are dictated by government contracting rules. Further variations in Gross Margin depend on the composition of sales in each segment, for example, in respect of the Products Segment margins may vary according to whether it is software or hardware, outright sale versus rental or lease. On the Services side margins fluctuate less. However, margins will depend on whether the sale relates to development or manufacturing. In the 2019 FY, margins were less due to the fact that there were more units of sale from the Services Segment than in the 2018 FY.\nFor more detailed information on the composition and disaggregation of our revenues, please refer to Note 12 of our audited Consolidated Financial Statements of October 31, 2019 and 2018 ( Segment Analysis\u201d section).\nResearch and Development (R&D):\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>2,801,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,571,714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 8.9% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe continue to invest in research and development to further our business goals including maintaining our lead in volumetric imaging sonar sector (Products Segment) and becoming an embedded supplier of mission computers through re-engineering our Thermite\u00ae (now Thermite\u00ae Octal) via our Services Segment and launching derivatives of the newly designed Thermite\u00ae Octal. The key Unique Selling Point for the Thermite\u00ae range is that we can customize these for specific customer requirements. Big competing companies sell standard mission computers and in general do not customize per requirement.\nIn the 2019 FY this category of expenditure increased by 8.9%.\nIn the 2019 FY, the Products Segment continued to invest in the 4th Gen and 5th Gen of its products (including its real time volumetric imaging sonar). In early 2020, the Products Segment will be transitioning a number of new products from our R&D division into production and for sale in the market such as its 5th Gen 5 Dimensional and 6 Dimensional (5D and 6D) sonars. This is a significant milestone for the business, and we believe will be pivotal in giving the Company a decisive and irrefutable lead in the underwater volumetric imaging sonar market. No other sonar is either 5D or 6D capable allowing the user to have configurable real time 3D data sets in parallel (Echoscope\u00ae PIPE). Many competing companies have recognized the importance of real time 3D and have started labelling their products as such. Our leap forward to a 6D platform will decisively distinguish our capabilities and we hope will cement our lead.\nThe Services Segment continues to invest in Thermite\u00ae Octal and we have now established an embedded engineering division within the Services Segment - with the goal of providing customizable Thermite\u00ae Octal solutions for embedding into a broader range of customer programs and solutions.\nIn the FY2019 Period, the Group invested in engineering GEN 1 of the production prototype of the Head Up Display System for Divers (the HUD\u201d) pursuant to the collaboration under the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement ( CRADA\u201d) with Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama Division ( NSWC PCD\u201d) for NAVSEA entered into on or around July 2018. Under its terms, the Company was required to take NSWC's concept into production by funding and delivering the GEN 1 HUD Prototype within 12 months of the Agreement. The Company has now achieved this goal and this has been formally confirmed by the Project Sponsor NAVSEA.\nFollowing the successful transitioning of the GEN 1 HUD product from NSWC PCD, the Company has now entered into an exclusive license with NSWC PCD to manufacture and sell in the commercial market in the USA. Subject to the terms of the exclusive license (such as payment of fees and royalties), the license will be for the duration of the Licensor's patent pertaining to the face plate used in the HUD and will be exclusive. It allows us to practice the invention in the USA in the commercial market. However, no license is required for sales outside of the USA or sales to the government. We also will have to pay an annual license fee and royalties on commercial sales. We also expect the Coda Octopus Echoscope\u00ae and HUD system will be included on the Approved Navy Use (ANU) list allowing the Navy and government bodies to acquire these items.\nWe anticipate that a small number of GEN 1 HUD units will be purchased across various Navy divisions and by NASA in 2020 for continued assessment. In the same time frame, we also expect to receive R&D funding from the Navy to commence the second generation (GEN 2) development between in January 2020.\nWe further anticipate that the GEN 1 HUD will be operational in the Navy Fleet in early 2020.\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe budgeted a total of $500,000 for the development of the first prototype HUD in 2019 and have largely expended this amount.\nWe believe we have reached the pinnacle of our current R&D investments in our products and we would expect that in 2020 these expenditures will remain approximately at the 2019 level.

We intend to launch some significant products in 2020 and we are refocusing our investments from R&D to sales and marketing. We therefore expect SG&A to increase to reflect investments we are making in recruiting a number of senior sales personnel across the Group.\nIn the 2020 FY, we expect to invest more in Marketing where we have a number of significant new products to bring to market including our 5th Gen 5D and 6D sonars and our Head Up Display (HUD) real time diving solutions for both the defense and commercial markets. The investment involves bringing in new sales and marketing staff, attending more trade events and travelling to see potential customers.\nIn respect of the category Rent\u201d, we expect this to be substantially lower in the 2020 period as most of our facilities associated with our operations are owned, except for our premises in Denmark where we have taken on new premises to ensure that we can continue to operate in the European Union irrespective of the outcome of Brexit (see the beginning of Item 7 where we discuss Brexit and its implications for our business, more fully).\nIn the 2019 FY we had expenses of $650,409 for stock based compensation (a non-cash item) as compared to $448,449 in the corresponding 2018 FY.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Income:\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>6,253,437 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,310,767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 88.9% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the 2019 FY both operating businesses (Products and Services) largely performed their business plan which resulted in an increase in revenues even though Gross Margins were less and R&D and SG&A increased.\nInterest Expense:\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>91,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>249,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease of 63.4% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn or around April 28, 2017 we entered into a Senior Secured Debenture Instrument with HSBC NA ( HSBC Debenture\u201d) for an amount of $8,000,000 ( Proceeds\u201d). This HSBC Debenture has an interest rate of 4.56% per annum. The Proceeds from the HSBC Debenture were used to repay an existing Senior Debenture which was obtained in 2007. As the interest payable under the HSBC Debenture was significantly lower, this resulted in this category of interest being reduced over time.\nOn or around March 28, 2018, using proceeds from a capital raise, the Company reduced its indebtedness under the HSBC Debenture to approximately $1,917,602. As of October 31, 2019, our balance on the HSBC Debenture was $1,059,574. The amortization schedule for the HSBC Debenture is set out in Note 8 of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of October 31, 2019 and 2018.\nDue to the events described in the preceding paragraph, our interest expense was reduced significantly in the 2019 FY.\nOther Income:\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>70,212 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 70.3% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe make-up of this category is UK Value Added Tax rebates from purchases made outside of the European Union by our UK operations and is subject to fluctuations based upon the amount of those purchases.\nNet Income before Income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2019 compared to the year ended October 31, 2018\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>6,232,553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,102,899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 100.9% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the 2019 FY, Net Income before taxes was considerably greater as a result of a 39.7% increase in our revenues over the 2018 FY.

This is due to the Company in the 2018 FY recognizing and recording a tax benefit of $1,754,169 as a result of management's judgement in the 2018 FY that the probability of utilizing the Company's Net Operating Loss ( NOLs\u201d) carry forwards had materially increased. In the 2018 FY, our Net Income after tax included a tax benefit of $1,754,169 whereas in the 2019 FY the Company recorded a tax expense of $1,007,354.\nComprehensive Income for the year ended October 31, 2019 compared to the year ended October 31, 2018\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>5,318,454 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,798,299 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 10.8% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe conduct a large part of our business in various foreign currencies, for example, the British pound and Australian Dollars.\nThis category is affected by foreign currency adjustments during the reporting period. In the 2019 FY we had a gain of $93,255 compared to a loss of $190,232 in the 2018 FY. There are generally significant foreign currency fluctuations particularly between the US$ (our reporting currency) and the British Pound. Since the UK decided to leave the European Union the British pound has been falling significantly against the US dollar (see Note 2 paragraph n of Notes to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for October 31, 2019 and 2018 for fuller information regarding our Foreign Currency Translation policy). See also Item 7 (Management Discussions and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations), where we discuss Currency Risks\u201d.\nSegment Analysis\nWe are operating in two reportable segments, which are managed separately based upon fundamental differences in their operations.

Company had an accumulated deficit of $26,769,207, working capital of $21,112,407 and stockholders' equity of $30,627,773. For the year then ended, the Company generated cash flow from operations of $6,391,269.\nWe believe that our current level of cash and cash generation will be sufficient to meet our short and medium-term liquidity needs. At October 31, 2019, we had cash on hand of approximately $11.7 million and both billed and unbilled receivables of approximately $6.7 million. Our current cash balance represents approximately 18 months of Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The Company continues to critically evaluate the level of expenses that we incur and reduce those expenses as appropriate.\nFurthermore, on or around November 26, 2019, the Company was granted a revolving line of credit of $4 million from HSBC NA. This line of credit is available to the Company for short term working capital. All amounts under the Revolving Line of Credit are payable at the end of each financial year. The facility is renewable annually. To date, the Company has not borrowed any funds under this credit line, and it has no current intent to borrow any funds under the arrangement in the near future.\nOur main liquidity issues are funding our research and development program ( R&D\u201d) which requires significant expenditures in attracting engineering skills and incurring non-recoverable and non-recurring costs for researching, developing and prototyping products; managing our currency exposure; and servicing our senior secured debentures.\nWe have a significant concern about adverse currency fluctuations and the effect that those currency fluctuations have on our operations and profitability. As mentioned previously, Brexit has had a significant negative effect on the value of the British pound versus the US Dollar. A significant portion of our business is in the United Kingdom and the substantial decrease in the value of the British pound is reflected in lower revenues for our product sales. In addition, all our loans are denominated in US Dollars, which means that the dollar value of those loans has effectively gone up since these are partially serviced with British Pounds. The UK is poised to leave the European Union on January 31, 2020 and fundamental uncertainties will continue until its' future relationship with the European Union member states is clarified. While we have chosen not to hedge any of our currency exposure, we continue to evaluate the need to do so and will consider a hedging strategy if and when appropriate.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash generated from operating activities for the year ended October 31, 2019 was $6,391,269. We recorded net income for the period of $5,225,199. Other items in uses and sources of funds from operations included non-cash charges related to depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, which collectively totaled $1,493,399. Changes in operating assets decreased net cash from operating activities by $645,553 and changes in current liabilities increased net cash from operating activities by $318,224.\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used by investing activities for the year ended October 31, 2019 was $1,582,558.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended October 31, 2019 was $692,705 as a result of paying down the debt of the Company and issuing stock for cash.\nSecured Promissory Note\nOn April 28, 2017, Coda Octopus Group, Inc. (the Company\u201d) together with its wholly owned US subsidiaries, Coda Octopus Products, Inc. and Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc. (together, the Subsidiaries\u201d), entered into a loan agreement with HSBC Bank NA (the Lender\u201d) for a loan in the principal amount of $8,000,000 (the Loan\u201d). The annual interest rate is fixed at 4.56%.\nThe obligations in connection with the repayment of the Loan are secured by all assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries. In addition, the repayment of the Loan is guaranteed by three of the Company's overseas subsidiaries.\nIn March 2018, the Company repaid a significant portion of the outstanding HSBC Debenture. As of October 31, 2019, we had $1,059,574 outstanding under this Debenture. We anticipate that the remaining balance will be repaid within 22 months from the end of the 2019 fiscal year.\nPrivate Placement\nOn January 29, 2018 ( Transaction Date\u201d), the Company consummated the sale and issuance of 1,125,950 shares of its common stock in a private placement of shares of common stock at $4.40 per share (the Offering\u201d). Total gross proceeds from the Offering were $4,954,180. The purchase price per share was based on a 10% discount of the volume weighted average price of the common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market for the 30-consecutive trading-day period ending on January 22, 2018. For a period of 36 months from the Transaction Date, the investors also have the right to purchase, based on their pro-rata ownership of common stock, shares (or securities convertible into shares) offered in subsequent offerings, subject to certain limited exceptions.\nForeign Currency\nThe Company maintains its books in local currency: US Dollars for its US operations, Pounds Sterling for its United Kingdom operations, Danish Kroner for its Danish operations and Australian Dollars for its Australian operations.\nFor the fiscal year ended 2019, 54% of the Company's operations were conducted inside the United States and 46% outside the United States through its wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly affect the Company's sales, profitability, balance sheet valuations and financial position when the foreign currencies of its international operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting. In addition, we are also subject to currency fluctuation risks with respect to certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. Although the Company cannot predict the extent to which currency fluctuations may affect the Company's business and financial position, there is a risk that such fluctuations will have an adverse impact on the Company's sales, profits, balance sheet valuations and financial position. Because differing portions of our revenues and costs are denominated in foreign currency, movements in those currencies could impact our margins by, for example, decreasing our foreign revenues when the dollar strengthens and not correspondingly decreasing our expenses. The Company does not currently hedge its currency exposure. In the future, we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risk.\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe translation of the Company's UK operations' British Pound denominated balance sheets and results of operations into US dollars was affected by changes in the average value of the US dollar against the British Pound.

These are:\n\nOur Marine Technology Business is a technology solution provider to the subsea market. It has a long-established pedigree in this market, and it designs, develops and manufactures proprietary solutions for this market (both for commercial and defense applications) including our range of flagship volumetric real time sonar solutions.\nThese solutions/products are used primarily in the underwater construction market, offshore oil and gas, offshore wind energy industry, and in the complex dredging, port security, mining and marine sciences sectors. Our customers include service providers to major oil and gas ( O&G\u201d) companies, law enforcement agencies, ports, mining companies, defense bodies, research institutes and universities.\nOur Marine Engineering Business is a supplier of engineering services and embedded solutions (such as mission computers) to prime defense contractors such as Raytheon and Northrop Grumman. Generally, the items supplied into the defense market are sub-systems in broader mission critical integrated systems and thus requires a high level of reliability, consistency in standards and robustness.\nWe have long-standing relationships with prime defense contractors, and we use these credentials to secure more business. We support some significant defense programs by supplying and maintaining proprietary parts (or parts for which we are preferred suppliers) through obsolescence management programs. These services provide recurring stream of revenues for our Services segment.\n 21 \n \nBoth Business Operations have established synergies in terms of customers and specialized engineering skill sets encompassing capturing, computing and displaying data in harsh environments.\nOur business is affected by a number of factors including those set out below:\n A. United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union ( Brexit\u201d) including the possibility that such withdrawal will take place without a deal on their future relationship ( No Deal Brexit Issue\u201d) \nFollowing a national referendum and the recent elections in the United Kingdom which saw a majority Government, a bill has now been passed for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union on January 31, 2020. A transitional period of 12 months is expected. During the transitional period, the United Kingdom Government and the European Union will negotiate its future trade relationship. If no agreement is reached, the UK Government which now has a majority for its actions, has stated that it will leave the European Union without a deal on its future relationship,\nA No Deal Brexit could affect our UK operations which represents a significant part of our earnings (Coda Octopus Products Limited (Edinburgh-based) and Coda Octopus Martech Limited (Portland, England-based).\nThe ongoing uncertainty also impacts the British Pound (which is the trading currency of our UK operations). Although the appointment of a majority government on December 13, 2019 saw a surge in the UK Pound against all major currencies, it is expected that the ongoing uncertainty around the future relationship with the European Union will cause the UK Pound to continue to be volatile against major currencies, including the US Dollar. Since our reporting currency is the US Dollar, depreciation of the UK Pound has an adverse impact on revenues reported and devaluation of our consolidated balance sheet assets.\nBecause there is no precedent for a European Union member state leaving the Union, the full implications for the Company are not clear. The outcome is dependent on the type of future relationship that is struck between the United Kingdom and the European Union. In a worst-case scenario, where no deal on the future of the UK relationship with the European Union is struck, it is widely believed that the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules will apply. Operating on this basis would have far-reaching implications for our Company particularly in the area of costs associated with import/export arrangements for our products including custom duties on purchases and sales and delays and increased compliance costs in the supply chain (both purchasing and selling). We currently benefit from mutual recognition rules in a number of areas including export control requirements and quality standards which allow us to distribute our products freely in the European Union. If these are removed it is likely to involve new qualifications requirements that we would need to meet with the attendant costs and delays involved. Furthermore, if free movement is restricted this will also limit our ability to utilize our trained engineers and experts on customer projects in the European Union.\nThe Company continues to make plans to mitigate the departure from the European Union. The Company established a company, Coda Octopus Products A/S, in Denmark to maintain a presence in the European Union and to address some of the foreseeable issues. However, we can give no assurance that this in itself would be sufficient to address the impact of both a No Deal Brexit and a No Deal Brexit.\n 22 \n \n B. Currency Risks: \nThe Company's operations are split between the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Denmark. A large proportion of our revenues (approximately 48%) and costs are incurred outside of the USA with a significant part (46% of our total revenues) of that in the United Kingdom ( UK\u201d). In addition, a significant part of our assets (both current and fixed) are held in British Pounds by our foreign subsidiaries. Fiscal years 2017 through 2019 saw the weakening of the British Pound. The continued uncertainty around the future relationship with the European Union and the United Kingdom, is likely to see significant volatility in the British Pound against major currencies. The depreciation of the British Pound against major currencies adversely impacts our revenues as a whole which are reported in U.S. Dollars. Furthermore, a large part of our assets is held in British Pounds while the majority of our liabilities (which comprise our senior secured debentures are maintained in U.S. Dollars see Note 8 - Loans and Notes Payable - of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements October 31, 2019 and 2018). In fiscal year 2019 we incurred a gain on our exchange rate translations in respect of our comprehensive income and loss account. See Note 2, paragraph n, of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements October 31, 2019 and 2018 regarding our Foreign Currency Translation policy. Until a longer-term trade arrangement is agreed between the United Kingdom and the European Union, we expect to see continued volatility in the British Pounds. We currently do not hedge our currency risks. However, we continue to evaluate the prudency of hedging such risks.\n C. Trade Disputes: \nThe costs of our raw materials could become a serious concern due to inter-country trade disputes. Our US Services Segment has suffered increased cost of raw materials sourced within the United States due to ongoing trade dispute between the USA, China and Canada. Furthermore, with the ongoing trade dispute between the USA and China, the Products Segment has seen a decline of sales into China in the 2019 fiscal year.\n D. Price of Commodities: \nThe price of commodities, in particular oil and gas ( O&G\u201d). The decline in O&G prices since 2014 with a partial recovery since 2016 has resulted in large scale reductions in capital and operational expenditures and seismic changes in the subsea market. This directly impacts on the Products Segment by reducing the quantity of sales and rentals into O&G and related markets. O&G has remained very competitive and customers are increasingly seeking significant discounts to place orders. Around 7% of the Marine Technology Business revenues emanate from this sector. Historically, and prior to the price downturn, the vast majority of our revenues were generated from O&G sector.\n E. Government Spending for Defense: \nThe allocation of funds to defense procurement by governments in the United States and the United Kingdom. A large part of our revenues in the Services Segment emanates from government funding in the defense sector. In general, where there is a change of government, spending priorities change which may have an impact on our revenues.\n F. Political Landscape: \nGlobal-political uncertainties affect the markets for our goods and services. For example, the current unrest in Hong Kong has resulted in significant shipments to China being delayed as we have seen an increased number of UK Customs Border Police detaining shipments to China. We anticipate that revenues will be affected if we are unable to meet our contractual obligations as a result of ship detentions.\nGlobal trends which make certain geographical regions more competitive in providing engineering solutions because of lower labor costs (e.g. India and China) are likely to affect our Services Segments.\n G. Resourcing Levels \nBeing a small technology company, we are hindered in our ability to compete for certain specialized electronic engineering skills as our remuneration package is not as competitive as those offered by bigger companies.\n 23 \n \n H. Investments: \nWe lack the financial resources to advance our flagship technology at the commercially appropriate pace required to capture new markets and increase our sales which could facilitate new entrants to the market. For example, Teledyne Technologies Incorporated, a multi-billion company, has recently acquired a number of subsea companies that may speed up their entry into our market.\nIn relative terms, the Company has limited external sources of capital available, and as such is reliant upon its ability to sell its products and services to provide sufficient working capital for its operations and obligations. Notwithstanding, on or around November 27, 2019 the Company secured a $4m Revolving Credit Line from HSBC NA, its current bankers which can be used for working capital including expansion activities as required.\n I. Technological Advancement: \nA significant part of our growth strategy is predicated on our flagship real time volumetric imaging sonar technology. The technology space is inherently uncertain due to the fast pace of innovations and therefore we can give no assurance that we can maintain our leading position in the real time volumetric imaging sonar market or that innovations in other areas may not surpass our unique capability that we currently supply to subsea market. Some examples of new technology entering the subsea market is LIDAR technology. However, this technology cannot be employed in zero visibility conditions and cannot generate a volume pulse or image moving objects.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported levels of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nBelow is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results and that may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2, Summary of Accounting Policies\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nAll of our revenues are earned under formal contracts with our customers and are derived from both sales and rental of underwater technologies and equipment for imaging, mapping, defense and survey applications and from the engineering services that we provide. Our contracts do not include the possibility for additional contingent consideration so that our determination of the contract price does not involve having to consider potential variable additional consideration. Our product sales do not include a right of return by the customer.\nWith regard to our Products Segment, all of our products are sold on a stand-alone basis and those market prices are evidence of the value of the products. To the extent that we also provide services (e.g., installation, training, etc.), those services are either included as part of the product or are subject to written contracts based on the stand-alone value of those services. Revenue from the sale of services is recognized when those services have been provided to the customer and evidence of the provision of those services exist.\nFor further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policies, refer to Note 2 - Revenue Recognition\u201d in these financial statements\n 24 \n \nStock based Compensation\nWe recognize the expense related to the fair value of stock based compensation awards within the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. The stock based fair value compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the performance of the services is completed (measurement date) and is recognized over the periods in which the related services are rendered.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under ASC 740, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the income tax effects of differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their bases for income tax reporting. The Company's differences arise principally from the use of various accelerated and modified accelerated cost recovery system lives for income tax purposes versus straight line depreciation used for book purposes and from the utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are the amounts by which the Company's future income taxes are expected to be impacted by these differences as they reverse. Deferred tax assets are based on differences that are expected to decrease future income taxes as they reverse. Correspondingly, deferred tax liabilities are based on differences that are expected to increase future income taxes as they reverse. Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and also presents the impact of significant differences between financial reporting income and taxable income.\n 25 \n \nFor income tax purposes, the Company uses the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues on long-term contracts which is consistent with the Company's financial reporting under U.S. GAAP.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist principally of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired (i.e. goodwill), customer relationships, non-compete agreements and licenses. Goodwill was allocated to our reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation. Goodwill is not amortized and is evaluated for impairment annually or more often if circumstances indicate impairment may exist. Customer relationships, non-compete agreements, patents and licenses are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of 2 to 15 years. The Company amortizes its limited lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists.\nThe first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its' carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value, which is based on future cash flows, exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the second step must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The Company will early adopt Accounting Standards Codification 2017 - 04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which permits the Company to impair the difference between carrying amount in excess of the fair value of the reporting unit as the reduction in goodwill. ASC 2017-04 eliminates the requirement in previous GAAP to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test.\nAt the end of each year, we evaluate goodwill on a separate reporting unit basis to assess recoverability, and impairments, if any, are recognized in earnings. An impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over the fair value of the reporting unit.\nFiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Results of Operations\nDuring the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019, the Marine Technology Business generated 52% of our consolidated revenues compared to 64% in the previous fiscal year and, similarly, the Marine Engineering Business generated 48% compared to 36% in the previous fiscal year respectively.\nOverall, consolidated revenues in the 2019 fiscal year were up by 39.1%; Gross Profit was up by 29.7%; Total Operating Expenses was up by 7.0%; Income from Operations was up by 94.1%; Net Income Before Taxes was up by 106.5%. There were no material exceptional costs or financial events in the 2019 fiscal year, except that in fiscal year 2019, we recorded a tax expense of $1,007,354 compared to a tax benefit of $1,754,169 in the 2018 fiscal year.\nIn the fiscal year 2019, R&D expenditures increased by 8.9% and SG&A by 8.8%. We believe we have reached the pinnacle of our investments in R&D in our 4th and 5th generations of our products and as such in 2020, we would expect to maintain R&D at approximately the same 2019 levels. The only exceptional expenses we anticipate will be in the investments we need to make to transition the production of the Navy Head Up Display (HUD) product production to the Orlando Office and incubating our embedded solutions division which we see as an investment in future growth of the Company. Under the terms of the exclusive license which is being negotiated with Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama Division to practice the invention pertaining to the HUD face plate, the Company must transfer such manufacturing within 12 months of grant of the exclusive license. We anticipate an investment of around $500,000 in the 2020 period to achieve the transfer. This investment will encompass (i) implementing the required security measures; (ii) recruiting and training personnel; and (iii) making our Orlando facilities (acquired in 2019) manufacturing ready.\nComparison of fiscal year ended October 31, 2019 ( 2019 Fiscal Year\u201d or 2019 FY\u201d) to fiscal year ended October 31, 2018 ( 2018 Fiscal Year\u201d or 2018 FY\u201d)\nThe information provided below pertains to the Company's consolidated financial results. For information on the performance of each Segment including the disaggregation of revenues and geographical split, see Note 12 of our audited Consolidated Financial Statements of October 31, 2019 and 2018.\n 26 \n \nRevenue:\n\nWe realized a significant increase in revenues in the 2019 FY compared to the 2018 FY. This is because in the 2019 FY our Services Segment achieved its revenue plan unlike the 2018 FY where it experienced delay in securing anticipated annual defense contracts as a result in the delay in the adoption of the US Federal Defense Budget. In the 2019 FY the Services Segment received backlog orders and is now back on plan.\nDuring 2019 Fiscal Year, the Products Segment generated revenues of $12,908,110 and Services Segment $12,148,824. During the 2019 FY, the Products Segment revenues grew by 12.7% over the 2018 FY and the Services Segment revenues grew by 84.9% over the said period.\nDuring the 2019 FY, the Company had one customer from whom it generated sales greater than 10% of net revenues. Revenue from this customer was $6,764,199 or 27% of net revenues during the 2019 FY. Total accounts receivable from this customer at October 31, 2019 was $898,584 or 20% of accounts receivable.\nGross Margin:\n\nGross Margin is determined by the composition of our consolidated sales achieved in the reporting period. In general, the Gross Profit Margins are greater on the Products Segment sales than the Services Segment as the latter's margins are dictated by government contracting rules. Further variations in Gross Margin depend on the composition of sales in each segment, for example, in respect of the Products Segment margins may vary according to whether it is software or hardware, outright sale versus rental or lease. On the Services side margins fluctuate less. However, margins will depend on whether the sale relates to development or manufacturing. In the 2019 FY, margins were less due to the fact that there were more units of sale from the Services Segment than in the 2018 FY.\nFor more detailed information on the composition and disaggregation of our revenues, please refer to Note 12 of our audited Consolidated Financial Statements of October 31, 2019 and 2018 ( Segment Analysis\u201d section).\nResearch and Development (R&D):\n\nWe continue to invest in research and development to further our business goals including maintaining our lead in volumetric imaging sonar sector (Products Segment) and becoming an embedded supplier of mission computers through re-engineering our Thermite\u00ae (now Thermite\u00ae Octal) via our Services Segment and launching derivatives of the newly designed Thermite\u00ae Octal. The key Unique Selling Point for the Thermite\u00ae range is that we can customize these for specific customer requirements. Big competing companies sell standard mission computers and in general do not customize per requirement.\nIn the 2019 FY this category of expenditure increased by 8.9%.\nIn the 2019 FY, the Products Segment continued to invest in the 4th Gen and 5th Gen of its products (including its real time volumetric imaging sonar). In early 2020, the Products Segment will be transitioning a number of new products from our R&D division into production and for sale in the market such as its 5th Gen 5 Dimensional and 6 Dimensional (5D and 6D) sonars. This is a significant milestone for the business, and we believe will be pivotal in giving the Company a decisive and irrefutable lead in the underwater volumetric imaging sonar market. No other sonar is either 5D or 6D capable allowing the user to have configurable real time 3D data sets in parallel (Echoscope\u00ae PIPE). Many competing companies have recognized the importance of real time 3D and have started labelling their products as such. Our leap forward to a 6D platform will decisively distinguish our capabilities and we hope will cement our lead.\nThe Services Segment continues to invest in Thermite\u00ae Octal and we have now established an embedded engineering division within the Services Segment - with the goal of providing customizable Thermite\u00ae Octal solutions for embedding into a broader range of customer programs and solutions.\nIn the FY2019 Period, the Group invested in engineering GEN 1 of the production prototype of the Head Up Display System for Divers (the HUD\u201d) pursuant to the collaboration under the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement ( CRADA\u201d) with Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama Division ( NSWC PCD\u201d) for NAVSEA entered into on or around July 2018. Under its terms, the Company was required to take NSWC's concept into production by funding and delivering the GEN 1 HUD Prototype within 12 months of the Agreement. The Company has now achieved this goal and this has been formally confirmed by the Project Sponsor NAVSEA.\nFollowing the successful transitioning of the GEN 1 HUD product from NSWC PCD, the Company has now entered into an exclusive license with NSWC PCD to manufacture and sell in the commercial market in the USA. Subject to the terms of the exclusive license (such as payment of fees and royalties), the license will be for the duration of the Licensor's patent pertaining to the face plate used in the HUD and will be exclusive. It allows us to practice the invention in the USA in the commercial market. However, no license is required for sales outside of the USA or sales to the government. We also will have to pay an annual license fee and royalties on commercial sales. We also expect the Coda Octopus Echoscope\u00ae and HUD system will be included on the Approved Navy Use (ANU) list allowing the Navy and government bodies to acquire these items.\nWe anticipate that a small number of GEN 1 HUD units will be purchased across various Navy divisions and by NASA in 2020 for continued assessment. In the same time frame, we also expect to receive R&D funding from the Navy to commence the second generation (GEN 2) development between in January 2020.\nWe further anticipate that the GEN 1 HUD will be operational in the Navy Fleet in early 2020.\n 27 \n \nWe budgeted a total of $500,000 for the development of the first prototype HUD in 2019 and have largely expended this amount.\nWe believe we have reached the pinnacle of our current R&D investments in our products and we would expect that in 2020 these expenditures will remain approximately at the 2019 level. Furthermore, we expect that GEN 2 of the HUD will be funded by the Navy.\nChanges in this category by Segment are set out immediately below:\n\nWe believe that we are at the point where we can now manage down R&D expenditures as we have achieved a number of significant development milestones. We will continue to innovate but we believe our 2020 focus will be in the areas of developing the market for our newly innovated and launched products - thus redirecting investments into sales and marketing.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A):\n\nKey Areas of SG&A Expenditure across the Group for the year ended October 31, 2019 compared to the year ended October 31, 2018\n\nIn our core areas of reporting on SG&A expenditures, variations between the 2019 FY and the 2018 FY were relatively modest, except in the category of Marketing where we expect this to continue", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe information herein contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact made herein are forward looking. In particular, the statements herein regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position are forward-looking statements.

No assurances can be given that the future results anticipated by the forward-looking statements will be achieved. Forward-looking statements reflect management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ significantly from management's expectations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, included herewith. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment of our management.\nGeneral Overview\nWe operate two distinct business operations. These are:\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Marine Technology Business ( also referred to as Products Segment\u201d); and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Marine Engineering Business ( also referred to as Services Segment\u201d). </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Marine Technology Business is a technology solution provider to the subsea market. It has a long-established pedigree in this market, and it designs, develops and manufactures proprietary solutions for this market (both for commercial and defense applications) including our range of flagship volumetric real time sonar solutions.\nThese solutions/products are used primarily in the underwater construction market, offshore oil and gas, offshore wind energy industry, and in the complex dredging, port security, mining and marine sciences sectors. Our customers include service providers to major oil and gas ( O&G\u201d) companies, law enforcement agencies, ports, mining companies, defense bodies, research institutes and universities.\nOur Marine Engineering Business is a supplier of engineering services and embedded solutions (such as mission computers) to prime defense contractors such as Raytheon and Northrop Grumman. Generally, the items supplied into the defense market are sub-systems in broader mission critical integrated systems and thus requires a high level of reliability, consistency in standards and robustness.\nWe have long-standing relationships with prime defense contractors, and we use these credentials to secure more business. We support some significant defense programs by supplying and maintaining proprietary parts (or parts for which we are preferred suppliers) through obsolescence management programs. These services provide recurring stream of revenues for our Services segment.\n 21 \n \nBoth Business Operations have established synergies in terms of customers and specialized engineering skill sets encompassing capturing, computing and displaying data in harsh environments.\nOur business is affected by a number of factors including those set out below:\n A. United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union ( Brexit\u201d) including the possibility that such withdrawal will take place without a deal on their future relationship ( No Deal Brexit Issue\u201d) \nFollowing a national referendum and the recent elections in the United Kingdom which saw a majority Government, a bill has now been passed for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union on January 31, 2020.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported levels of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nBelow is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results and that may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2, Summary of Accounting Policies\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nAll of our revenues are earned under formal contracts with our customers and are derived from both sales and rental of underwater technologies and equipment for imaging, mapping, defense and survey applications and from the engineering services that we provide. Our contracts do not include the possibility for additional contingent consideration so that our determination of the contract price does not involve having to consider potential variable additional consideration. Our product sales do not include a right of return by the customer.\nWith regard to our Products Segment, all of our products are sold on a stand-alone basis and those market prices are evidence of the value of the products. To the extent that we also provide services (e.g., installation, training, etc.), those services are either included as part of the product or are subject to written contracts based on the stand-alone value of those services. Revenue from the sale of services is recognized when those services have been provided to the customer and evidence of the provision of those services exist.\nFor further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policies, refer to Note 2 - Revenue Recognition\u201d in these financial statements\n 24 \n \nStock based Compensation\nWe recognize the expense related to the fair value of stock based compensation awards within the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. The stock based fair value compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the performance of the services is completed (measurement date) and is recognized over the periods in which the related services are rendered.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under ASC 740, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the income tax effects of differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their bases for income tax reporting. The Company's differences arise principally from the use of various accelerated and modified accelerated cost recovery system lives for income tax purposes versus straight line depreciation used for book purposes and from the utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are the amounts by which the Company's future income taxes are expected to be impacted by these differences as they reverse. Deferred tax assets are based on differences that are expected to decrease future income taxes as they reverse. Correspondingly, deferred tax liabilities are based on differences that are expected to increase future income taxes as they reverse. Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and also presents the impact of significant differences between financial reporting income and taxable income.\n 25 \n \nFor income tax purposes, the Company uses the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues on long-term contracts which is consistent with the Company's financial reporting under U.S. GAAP.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist principally of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired (i.e. goodwill), customer relationships, non-compete agreements and licenses. Goodwill was allocated to our reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation. Goodwill is not amortized and is evaluated for impairment annually or more often if circumstances indicate impairment may exist. Customer relationships, non-compete agreements, patents and licenses are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of 2 to 15 years. The Company amortizes its limited lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists.\nThe first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its' carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value, which is based on future cash flows, exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the second step must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The Company will early adopt Accounting Standards Codification 2017 - 04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which permits the Company to impair the difference between carrying amount in excess of the fair value of the reporting unit as the reduction in goodwill. ASC 2017-04 eliminates the requirement in previous GAAP to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test.\nAt the end of each year, we evaluate goodwill on a separate reporting unit basis to assess recoverability, and impairments, if any, are recognized in earnings. An impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over the fair value of the reporting unit.\nFiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Results of Operations\nDuring the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019, the Marine Technology Business generated 52% of our consolidated revenues compared to 64% in the previous fiscal year and, similarly, the Marine Engineering Business generated 48% compared to 36% in the previous fiscal year respectively.\nOverall, consolidated revenues in the 2019 fiscal year were up by 39.1%; Gross Profit was up by 29.7%; Total Operating Expenses was up by 7.0%; Income from Operations was up by 94.1%; Net Income Before Taxes was up by 106.5%. There were no material exceptional costs or financial events in the 2019 fiscal year, except that in fiscal year 2019, we recorded a tax expense of $1,007,354 compared to a tax benefit of $1,754,169 in the 2018 fiscal year.\nIn the fiscal year 2019, R&D expenditures increased by 8.9% and SG&A by 8.8%. We believe we have reached the pinnacle of our investments in R&D in our 4th and 5th generations of our products and as such in 2020, we would expect to maintain R&D at approximately the same 2019 levels. The only exceptional expenses we anticipate will be in the investments we need to make to transition the production of the Navy Head Up Display (HUD) product production to the Orlando Office and incubating our embedded solutions division which we see as an investment in future growth of the Company. Under the terms of the exclusive license which is being negotiated with Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama Division to practice the invention pertaining to the HUD face plate, the Company must transfer such manufacturing within 12 months of grant of the exclusive license. We anticipate an investment of around $500,000 in the 2020 period to achieve the transfer. This investment will encompass (i) implementing the required security measures; (ii) recruiting and training personnel; and (iii) making our Orlando facilities (acquired in 2019) manufacturing ready.\nComparison of fiscal year ended October 31, 2019 ( 2019 Fiscal Year\u201d or 2019 FY\u201d) to fiscal year ended October 31, 2018 ( 2018 Fiscal Year\u201d or 2018 FY\u201d)\nThe information provided below pertains to the Company's consolidated financial results. For information on the performance of each Segment including the disaggregation of revenues and geographical split, see Note 12 of our audited Consolidated Financial Statements of October 31, 2019 and 2018.\n 26 \n \nRevenue:\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>25,056,934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,019,429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 39.1% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe realized a significant increase in revenues in the 2019 FY compared to the 2018 FY. This is because in the 2019 FY our Services Segment achieved its revenue plan unlike the 2018 FY where it experienced delay in securing anticipated annual defense contracts as a result in the delay in the adoption of the US Federal Defense Budget. In the 2019 FY the Services Segment received backlog orders and is now back on plan.\nDuring 2019 Fiscal Year, the Products Segment generated revenues of $12,908,110 and Services Segment $12,148,824. During the 2019 FY, the Products Segment revenues grew by 12.7% over the 2018 FY and the Services Segment revenues grew by 84.9% over the said period.\nDuring the 2019 FY, the Company had one customer from whom it generated sales greater than 10% of net revenues. Revenue from this customer was $6,764,199 or 27% of net revenues during the 2019 FY. Total accounts receivable from this customer at October 31, 2019 was $898,584 or 20% of accounts receivable.\nGross Margin:\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>65.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>70.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease of 4.8 percentage points </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(gross profit of $16,429,319) </td> <td> </td> <td>(gross profit of $12,662,362) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Margin is determined by the composition of our consolidated sales achieved in the reporting period. In general, the Gross Profit Margins are greater on the Products Segment sales than the Services Segment as the latter's margins are dictated by government contracting rules. Further variations in Gross Margin depend on the composition of sales in each segment, for example, in respect of the Products Segment margins may vary according to whether it is software or hardware, outright sale versus rental or lease. On the Services side margins fluctuate less. However, margins will depend on whether the sale relates to development or manufacturing. In the 2019 FY, margins were less due to the fact that there were more units of sale from the Services Segment than in the 2018 FY.\nFor more detailed information on the composition and disaggregation of our revenues, please refer to Note 12 of our audited Consolidated Financial Statements of October 31, 2019 and 2018 ( Segment Analysis\u201d section).\nResearch and Development (R&D):\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>2,801,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,571,714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 8.9% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe continue to invest in research and development to further our business goals including maintaining our lead in volumetric imaging sonar sector (Products Segment) and becoming an embedded supplier of mission computers through re-engineering our Thermite\u00ae (now Thermite\u00ae Octal) via our Services Segment and launching derivatives of the newly designed Thermite\u00ae Octal. The key Unique Selling Point for the Thermite\u00ae range is that we can customize these for specific customer requirements. Big competing companies sell standard mission computers and in general do not customize per requirement.\nIn the 2019 FY this category of expenditure increased by 8.9%.\nIn the 2019 FY, the Products Segment continued to invest in the 4th Gen and 5th Gen of its products (including its real time volumetric imaging sonar). In early 2020, the Products Segment will be transitioning a number of new products from our R&D division into production and for sale in the market such as its 5th Gen 5 Dimensional and 6 Dimensional (5D and 6D) sonars. This is a significant milestone for the business, and we believe will be pivotal in giving the Company a decisive and irrefutable lead in the underwater volumetric imaging sonar market. No other sonar is either 5D or 6D capable allowing the user to have configurable real time 3D data sets in parallel (Echoscope\u00ae PIPE). Many competing companies have recognized the importance of real time 3D and have started labelling their products as such. Our leap forward to a 6D platform will decisively distinguish our capabilities and we hope will cement our lead.\nThe Services Segment continues to invest in Thermite\u00ae Octal and we have now established an embedded engineering division within the Services Segment - with the goal of providing customizable Thermite\u00ae Octal solutions for embedding into a broader range of customer programs and solutions.\nIn the FY2019 Period, the Group invested in engineering GEN 1 of the production prototype of the Head Up Display System for Divers (the HUD\u201d) pursuant to the collaboration under the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement ( CRADA\u201d) with Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama Division ( NSWC PCD\u201d) for NAVSEA entered into on or around July 2018. Under its terms, the Company was required to take NSWC's concept into production by funding and delivering the GEN 1 HUD Prototype within 12 months of the Agreement. The Company has now achieved this goal and this has been formally confirmed by the Project Sponsor NAVSEA.\nFollowing the successful transitioning of the GEN 1 HUD product from NSWC PCD, the Company has now entered into an exclusive license with NSWC PCD to manufacture and sell in the commercial market in the USA. Subject to the terms of the exclusive license (such as payment of fees and royalties), the license will be for the duration of the Licensor's patent pertaining to the face plate used in the HUD and will be exclusive. It allows us to practice the invention in the USA in the commercial market. However, no license is required for sales outside of the USA or sales to the government. We also will have to pay an annual license fee and royalties on commercial sales. We also expect the Coda Octopus Echoscope\u00ae and HUD system will be included on the Approved Navy Use (ANU) list allowing the Navy and government bodies to acquire these items.\nWe anticipate that a small number of GEN 1 HUD units will be purchased across various Navy divisions and by NASA in 2020 for continued assessment. In the same time frame, we also expect to receive R&D funding from the Navy to commence the second generation (GEN 2) development between in January 2020.\nWe further anticipate that the GEN 1 HUD will be operational in the Navy Fleet in early 2020.\n 27 \n \nWe budgeted a total of $500,000 for the development of the first prototype HUD in 2019 and have largely expended this amount.\nWe believe we have reached the pinnacle of our current R&D investments in our products and we would expect that in 2020 these expenditures will remain approximately at the 2019 level. Furthermore, we expect that GEN 2 of the HUD will be funded by the Navy.\nChanges in this category by Segment are set out immediately below:\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>Description </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% increase /\n(decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marine Technology Business (Products Segment) 2019FY </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,208,749 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marine Technology Business (Products Segment) 2018FY </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,048,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marine Engineering Business (Services Segment) 2019 FY </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>146,061 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(64.93 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marine Engineering Business (Services Segment) 2018 FY </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>455,414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Coda Octopus Group, Inc. 2019 FY (representing the HUD Costs) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>446,521 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Infinite\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Coda Octopus Group, Inc. 2018 FY </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>Nil </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that we are at the point where we can now manage down R&D expenditures as we have achieved a number of significant development milestones.
