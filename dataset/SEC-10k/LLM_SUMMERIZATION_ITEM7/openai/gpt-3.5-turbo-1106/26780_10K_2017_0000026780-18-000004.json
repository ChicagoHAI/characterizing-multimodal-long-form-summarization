Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Dollars in millions)\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8.\nManagement Overview\nWe are a global provider of high-technology products to virtually every major vehicle and engine manufacturer in the world. We also serve the stationary industrial market. Our technologies include drive and motion products (axles, driveshafts, planetary hub drives, power-transmission products, tire-management products and transmissions); sealing solutions (gaskets, seals, heat shields and fuel-cell plates); thermal-management technologies (transmission and engine oil cooling, battery and electronics cooling and exhaust-gas heat recovery); and fluid-power products (pumps, valves, motors and controls). We serve our global light vehicle, medium/heavy vehicle and off-highway markets through four business units - Light Vehicle Driveline Technologies (Light Vehicle), Commercial Vehicle Driveline Technologies (Commercial Vehicle), Off-Highway Drive and Motion Technologies (Off-Highway) and Power Technologies, which is the center of excellence for sealing and thermal-management technologies that span all customers in our on-highway and off-highway markets. We have a diverse customer base and geographic footprint which minimizes our exposure to individual market and segment declines. In 2017, 51% of our sales came from North American operations and 49% from operations throughout the rest of the world. Our sales by operating segment were Light Vehicle - 44%, Commercial Vehicle - 20%, Off-Highway - 21% and Power Technologies - 15%.\nOperational and Strategic Initiatives\nOur enterprise strategy builds on our strong technology foundation and leverages our resources across the organization while maintaining a customer centric focus, expanding our global markets, and accelerating the commercialization of new technology as we evolve into the era of vehicle electrification.\nCentral to our strategy is leveraging our core operations by sharing our capabilities, technology, assets and knowledge across the enterprise, leading to improved execution and increased customer satisfaction. Through streamlining and rationalizing our manufacturing activities we have significantly improved our profitability and margins, and we believe additional opportunities remain to further optimize our manufacturing footprint and improve our cost performance. Leveraging investments across multiple end markets and making disciplined, value enhancing acquisitions will allow us to bring product to market faster, grow our top-line sales and enhance financial returns.\nStrengthening customer centricity and expanding global markets are key elements of our strategy that focus on market penetration. Foundational to growing the business is directing the entire organization to putting the customer at the center of our value system and shifting from transactional to relationship-based interactions. These relationships are built on a foundation of providing unparalleled technology with exceptional quality, delivery and value. With even stronger relationships we will be better positioned to support our customers' most important global and flagship programs and capitalize on future growth opportunities.\nWe continue to enhance and expand our global footprint, optimizing it to capture growth across all of our end markets. Specifically, our manufacturing and technology center footprint positions us to support customers globally - an important factor as many of our customers are increasingly focused on common solutions for global platforms. Our acquisition of the Brevini operations in 2017 (see Acquisitions section below) provided us with operational presence in eight additional countries, while also providing us with additional opportunities to leverage our global footprint to support the needs across all our businesses. Shortly following the acquisition, we were able to consolidate certain Brevini activities in China, allowing us to utilize an acquired facility to support our Power Technologies business in China.\nWhile growth opportunities are present in each region of the world, we have a primary focus on building our presence and local capability in the Asia Pacific region. Over the last few years, we have opened two new engineering facilities in the region, gear manufacturing facilities in India and Thailand, and are currently developing a new light vehicle assembly facility in China that is scheduled to commence operations in 2018.\nIn addition to Asia, we see further growth opportunity in Eastern Europe. A new gear manufacturing facility in Hungary is under construction and scheduled to commence operations in the first half of 2018. This will be our third facility in the country and will give us the capability to cost effectively manufacture gears, one of our core technologies, and efficiently service our customers within the region.\nThe final two elements of our enterprise strategy, commercializing new technology and accelerating hybridization and electrification, focus on opportunities for product expansion. Bringing new innovations to market as industry leading products will drive growth as our new products and technology provide our customers with cutting-edge solutions, address end user needs and capitalize on key market trends. An example is our industry leading electronically disconnecting all-wheel drive technology, which we believe is the most fuel efficient rapidly disconnecting system in the market, will be utilized on a Ford Motor Company global vehicle platform - opening up new commercial channels for us in the passenger car, crossover and sport utility vehicle markets. The above-referenced new assembly facility under construction in China will support this new program.\nInitiatives to capitalize on evolving hybridization and electrification vehicle trends are a core ingredient of our current strategy. In addition to our current technologies in battery cooling and fuel cells, this element of our strategy is leveraging our electronics controls expertise across all our business units and applications such as advanced vehicle hybridization and electrification initiatives. We are working with customers to develop new solutions for those markets where electrification will be adopted first such as hybrids, buses and urban delivery vehicles. These new solutions, which include advanced electric propulsion systems with fully integrated motors and controls, are included in our recently launched Spicer Electrified portfolio of products. Working with our joint venture partner, our latest integrated e-axle is scheduled to launch in the first quarter of 2018 in a bus application in China.\nThe development and implementation of our enterprise strategy is positioning Dana to grow profitably due to increased customer focus as we leverage our core capabilities, expand into new markets, develop and commercialize new technologies including for hybrid and electric vehicles.\nCapital Structure Initiatives\nIn addition to investing in our business, we plan to continue prioritizing the allocation of capital to reduce debt and maintain a strong financial position. In January 2018, we announced our intention to drive toward investment grade metrics as part of a balanced approach to our capital allocation priorities and our goal of further strengthening our balance sheet.\nShareholder return actions - When evaluating capital structure initiatives, we balance our growth opportunities and shareholder value initiatives with maintaining a strong balance sheet and access to capital. Our strong financial position has enabled us to simplify our capital structure while providing returns to our shareholders in the form of cash dividends and a reduction in the number of shares outstanding. Over the past five years, we returned $1,481 of cash to shareholders by redeeming all of our preferred stock and repurchasing common shares. From program inception in 2012 through December 31, 2017, we repurchased approximately 74 million shares, inclusive of the common share equivalent reduction resulting from redemption of preferred shares. With the availability under the previous authorization having expired, our Board of Directors authorized a new $100 share repurchase program which was effective January 2018 and expires at the end of 2019. We declared and paid quarterly common stock dividends over the past five years, raising the dividend from five cents to six cents per share in the second quarter of 2015. In recognition of our strong financial performance and confidence in our financial outlook, our Board approved an additional four cents per share increase in the quarterly dividend to ten cents per share in 2018.\nFinancing actions - We have taken advantage of the lower interest rate environment to complete refinancing transactions in each of the past four years that resulted in lower effective interest rates while extending maturities. In 2017, we completed a $400 2025 note offering and entered into a $275 floating rate term loan. The proceeds of these issuances were used to repay higher cost international debt and to repay $450 of 2021 notes. In connection with amending our credit agreement to effectuate the term loan, we also increased our revolving credit facility by $100, providing us with $600 of back-up liquidity through 2022. Additionally, in 2017 we commenced the process of terminating one of our U.S. pension plans. This action allows us to effectively eliminate pension obligations and the associated future funding risk associated with interest rate and other market developments. We expect the termination action to be completed in 2019.\nOther Initiatives\nAftermarket opportunities - We have a global group dedicated to identifying and developing aftermarket growth opportunities that leverage the capabilities within our existing businesses - targeting increased future aftermarket sales. In January 2016, we completed the acquisition of Magnum\u00ae Gaskets' (Magnum) aftermarket distribution business, providing us access to new customers for sealing products and an additional aftermarket channel for other products. Powered by recognized brands such as Dana\u00ae, Spicer\u00ae, Victor Reinz\u00ae, Glaser\u00ae, GWB\u00ae, Thompson\u00ae, Tru-Cool\u00ae, SVL\u00ae, and Transejes\u2122, Dana delivers a broad range of aftermarket solutions - including genuine, all makes, and value lines - servicing passenger, commercial and off-highway vehicles across the globe.\nSelective acquisitions - Our acquisition focus is principally directed at bolt-on\u201d or adjacent acquisition opportunities that have a strategic fit with our existing core businesses, particularly opportunities that support our enterprise strategy and enhance the value proposition of our product offerings. Any potential acquisition will be evaluated in the same manner we currently consider customer program opportunities and other uses of capital - with a disciplined financial approach designed to ensure profitable growth and increased shareholder value.\nAcquisitions\nUSM - Warren - On March 1, 2017, we completed the purchase of Warren Manufacturing LLC (USM - Warren), which holds certain assets and liabilities of the former Warren, Michigan production unit of U.S. Manufacturing Corporation (USM). With this transaction, we acquired proprietary tube-manufacturing processes and light-weighting intellectual property for axle tubes and shafts. Significant content was previously purchased from USM. Vertically integrating this content strengthens the supply chain for several of our most strategic customers. The new product and process technologies for light-weighting will assist our customers in achieving their sustainability and fuel efficiency goals. The USM - Warren acquisition added $96 of sales and $12 of adjusted EBITDA in 2017. The results of operations of the USM - Warren business are reported within our Light Vehicle operating segment.\nWe paid $104 for this business at closing, including $25 to effectively settle trade payable obligations originating from product purchases Dana made from USM prior to the acquisition. No debt was assumed with this transaction which was funded using cash on hand. Post-closing purchase price adjustments for working capital and other items, which totaled less than $1, were received in this year's third quarter. Reference is made to Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for the allocation of purchase consideration to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nBFP and BPT - On February 1, 2017, we acquired 80% ownership interests in Brevini Fluid Power S.p.A. (BFP) and Brevini Power Transmission S.p.A. (BPT) from Brevini Group S.p.A. (Brevini). The acquisition expands our Off-Highway operating segment product portfolio to include technologies for tracked vehicles, doubling our addressable market for off-highway driveline systems and establishing Dana as the only off-highway solutions provider that can manage the power to both move the equipment and perform its critical work functions. This acquisition also brings a platform of technologies that can be leveraged in our light and commercial vehicle end markets, helping to accelerate our hybridization and electrification initiatives. The BFP and BPT acquisitions added $401 of sales and $40 of adjusted EBITDA in 2017. The results of operations of these businesses are reported within our Off-Highway operating segment.\nWe paid $181 at closing using cash on hand and assumed debt of $181 as part of the transaction. In December 2017, a purchase price reduction of $9 was agreed under the sale and purchase agreement provisions for determination of the net indebtedness and net working capital levels of BFP and BPT as of the closing date. In connection with the acquisition of BFP and BPT, Dana agreed to purchase certain real estate currently being leased by BPT from a Brevini affiliate for \u20ac25 by November 1, 2017. Purchase at this date did not occur due to document transfer requirements not having been fully satisfied. Receipt of the purchase price adjustment will occur concurrent with the completion of the real estate purchase during the first quarter of 2018. Reference is made to Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for the allocation of purchase consideration to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The terms of the agreement provide Dana the right to call Brevini's noncontrolling interests in BFP and BPT, and Brevini the right to put its noncontrolling interests in BFP and BPT to Dana, assuming Dana does not exercise its call rights, at dates and prices defined in the agreement.\nSIFCO - On December 23, 2016, we acquired strategic assets of the commercial vehicle steer axle systems and related forged components businesses of SIFCO. The acquisition enables us to enhance our vertically integrated supply chain, which will further improve our cost structure and customer satisfaction by leveraging SIFCO's extensive experience and knowledge of sophisticated forged components. In addition to strengthening our position as a central source for products that use forged and machined parts throughout the region, this acquisition enables us to better accommodate the local content requirements of our customers, which reduces their import and other region-specific costs.\nAs part of the acquisition, we added two manufacturing facilities and approximately 1,400 employees. The strategic assets were acquired by Dana free and clear of any liens, claims or encumbrances and without assumption of any legacy liabilities of SIFCO. We had sales of $86 in 2016 resulting from business conducted under the previous supply agreement with SIFCO. The additional business relationships obtained as a result of the acquisition generated incremental sales of $44 in 2017. The results of operations of the SIFCO related business are reported within our Commercial Vehicle operating segment.\nThe SIFCO purchase price was $70, with the payment of $10 of the purchase price deferred until December 2017 pending any claims under indemnification provisions of the purchase agreement. In December 2017, the parties to the SIFCO transaction entered into a settlement agreement. Under this agreement, $3 was paid to the seller with the remaining deferred\npurchase price of $7 being retained by Dana to settle indemnification claims. After the settlement of all indemnification claims, any remaining deferred purchase price will be paid to the seller. Reference is made to Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for the allocation of purchase consideration to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nMagnum - On January 29, 2016, we acquired the aftermarket distribution business of Magnum, a U.S.-based supplier of gaskets and sealing products for automotive and commercial vehicle applications, for a cash payment of $18. Assets acquired included trademarks and trade names, customer relationships and goodwill. The results of operations of Magnum are reported within our Power Technologies operating segment.\nDivestitures\nBrazil Suspension Components Operations - In December 2017, we entered into an agreement to divest our Brazil suspension components business (the disposal group). This business is non-core to our enterprise strategy and under-performing financially. As such, we agreed to divest the business for no consideration and contribute $10 of additional cash to the business prior to closing. Completion of the sale is expected in the first quarter of 2018 upon receipt of Brazilian antitrust approval. The disposal group was classified as held for sale at December 31, 2017. We recognized a pre-tax loss of $27 in the fourth quarter of 2017 to adjust the carrying value of the net assets to fair value and to recognize the liability for the additional cash required to be contributed to the business prior to closing. Reference is made to Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information, including the carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities of the disposal group held for sale at December 31, 2017. Sales of the business being divested approximated $23 in 2017. In connection with the divestiture of this business, we entered into a supply agreement whereby Dana will purchase specified components to satisfy customer requirements from the purchaser of the divested business at market prices.\nNippon Reinz - On November 30, 2016, we sold our 53.7% interest in Nippon Reinz Co. Ltd. (Nippon Reinz) to Nichias Corporation. Dana received net cash proceeds of $5 and recognized a pre-tax loss of $3 on the divestiture of Nippon Reinz, inclusive of the derecognition of the related noncontrolling interest. Nippon Reinz had sales of $42 in 2016 through the transaction date.\nDana Companies - On December 30, 2016, we completed the divestiture of Dana Companies, LLC (DCLLC), a consolidated wholly-owned limited liability company that was established as part of our reorganization in 2008 to hold and manage personal injury asbestos claims retained by the reorganized Dana Corporation, which was merged into DCLLC. The assets of DCLLC at time of sale included cash and marketable securities along with the rights to insurance coverage in place to satisfy a significant portion of its liabilities. We received net cash proceeds of $29 at closing on December 30, 2016, with $3 retained by the purchaser subject to the satisfaction of certain future conditions. We recognized a pre-tax loss of $77 in 2016 upon completion of the transaction. We received payment of the retained $3 in the second quarter of 2017 and recognized such amount as income. Following completion of the sale, Dana has no obligation with respect to current or future asbestos claims. The sale of this business also enhanced our available liquidity since the net proceeds from the sale are available for use in our core businesses.\nVenezuela Operations - In December 2014, we entered into an agreement to divest our operations in Venezuela (the disposal group) to an unaffiliated company for no consideration. We completed the divestiture in January 2015. In connection with the divestiture, we entered into a supply and technology agreement whereby Dana will supply product and technology to the operations at competitive market prices. Dana has no obligations to otherwise provide support to the operations. The disposal group was classified as held for sale at December 31, 2014, and we recognized a net charge of $77 - an $80 loss to adjust the carrying value of the net assets to fair value less cost to sell, with a reduction of $3 for the noncontrolling interest share of the loss. These assets and liabilities were presented as held for sale on our December 31, 2014 balance sheet. Upon completion of the divestiture of the disposal group in January 2015, we recognized a gain of $5 on the derecognition of the noncontrolling interest in a former Venezuelan subsidiary in other income (expense), net. We also credited other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) attributable to the parent for $10 and OCI attributable to noncontrolling interests for $1 to eliminate the unrecognized pension expense recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information. With the completion of the sale in January 2015, Dana has no remaining investment in Venezuela.\nStructural Products Business - In 2010, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our Structural Products business to Metalsa S.A. de C.V. (Metalsa) and reached a final agreement with the buyer on disputed issues in May 2014. Prior to the third quarter of 2012, Structural Products was reported as an operating segment of continuing operations. With the cessation of the retained operations in the third quarter of 2012, we began reporting the activities relating to the Structural Products business as discontinued operations. Legal and other costs incurred in 2014 to settle a customer complaint and the\nremaining disputes with Metalsa and insurance recoveries in 2015 related to previously outstanding claims have extended the reporting of discontinued operations.\nSegments\nWe manage our operations globally through four operating segments. Our Light Vehicle and Power Technologies segments primarily support light vehicle original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) with products for light trucks, SUVs, CUVs, vans and passenger cars. The Commercial Vehicle segment supports the OEMs of on-highway commercial vehicles (primarily trucks and buses), while our Off-Highway segment supports OEMs of off-highway vehicles (primarily wheeled vehicles used in construction, mining and agricultural applications).\nTrends in Our Markets\nGlobal Vehicle Production\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

</tr>\n</table>\nNorth America\nLight vehicle markets - Improving economic conditions during the past few years have contributed to increased light vehicle sales and production levels in North America. Overall economic conditions in North America continue to be relatively favorable with improving employment levels and upward trending consumer confidence. After increasing by about 1% in 2016 from 2015, the North America light vehicle market begun to show signs of weakening demand levels this past year as strong sales levels the past few years have significantly reduced the built-up demand to replace older vehicles. As such, 2017 light vehicle sales declined about 2% from 2016. Within the light vehicle segment, passenger car sales declined around 5% in 2016, and another 9% in 2017. In part due to comparatively low fuel prices when compared with recent years, demand for light trucks and SUVs continued to be strong, increasing about 7% in 2016 and 4% in 2017. Many of our customer programs are focused in the full frame light truck segment. Sales in this segment increased 6% in 2016 and another 3% in 2017. Production levels were generally reflective of light vehicle sales. Production of 17.8 million light vehicles in 2016 was 2% higher than 2015, with 2017 light vehicle production coming in at approximately 17.1 million units - down 4% from 2016. Light vehicle engine production was impacted more by the developments in the passenger car segment, with production in 2017 declining about 7% versus\n2016 after increasing 3% year-over-year in 2016. In the key full frame light truck segment, production levels in 2017 increased about 3% compared to 2016 following an increase of 7% in 2016 from the preceding year. Days' supply of total light vehicles in the U.S. at the end of December the past three years has been around 61 to 62 days. In the full frame light truck segment, days supply in inventory at December 31, 2017 approximated 64 days, down slightly from 65 days at December 31, 2016 and up from 62 days at the end of December 2015.\nLight truck markets are expected to remain relatively strong given the positive North America economic environment that is expected to drive continued growth in manufacturing and construction activities in 2018. Rising interest rates, less pent-up demand, higher levels of consumer debt and declining used car prices may constrict demand. We expect Dana sales will continue to benefit from strong market demand for key vehicles that we supply which launched within the past two years. Our current outlook for 2018 has full frame light truck production at 4.0 to 4.3 million vehicles, comparable to down 8% with 2017 production of about 4.3 million vehicles. We expect light vehicle engine production in 2018 to be 14.8 to 15.1 million units, comparable to up slightly compared to this past year.\nMedium/heavy vehicle markets - The commercial vehicle market is similarly impacted by many of the same macroeconomic developments impacting the light vehicle market. Strong production levels in the heavy truck segment in 2014 and first half of 2015 led to more trucks than required to meet freight demand. As a consequence, production levels in 2016 were scaled back. Class 8 heavy truck production in 2016 declined 29% from 2015, while Classes 5-7 medium truck build was relatively comparable. The North American economy gaining strength in 2017 has led to increased freight-hauling demand and a strengthening order book for new Class 8 trucks. During 2017, heavy duty Class 8 truck production was up approximately 12% while medium duty Classes 5-7 truck production was up 6% compared with 2016.\nClass 8 order levels increased significantly during the second half of 2017, positioning 2018 to be a strong production year. With the strong Class 8 order book and an expectation that the North America economic environment will continue to be strong in 2018, our outlook for 2018 Class 8 production in North America is 290,000 to 310,000 trucks, a level which is up about 14 to 22% compared with the 2017 build level. In the medium duty segment, we expect full year 2018 production to be in the range of 245,000 to 255,000 vehicles, comparable to up 4% from 2017.\nMarkets Outside of North America\nLight vehicle markets - Signs of an improved overall European economy have been evident, albeit mixed at times, during the past few years. While improving modestly in 2015 and 2016, signs of a strengthening economic climate were evident in 2017. Reflective of an improved economic environment, light vehicle engine production was up about 3% in both 2016 and 2017 and light truck production was higher by 9 to 10% in each of the past two years. The United Kingdom's decision to withdraw from the European Union, along with political developments in other European countries, continues to cast an element of uncertainty around continued economic improvement in the region. At present, we expect overall stable to improving economic conditions across the entire region in 2018. Our full year 2018 outlook expects an increase in light truck and light vehicle engine production of around 3 to 6% from 2017. The economic climate in many South American markets the past few years has been weak, volatile and challenging. After significant production declines in 2014 and 2015, there were signs that demand levels had bottomed out in 2016. Production levels in 2017 were reflective of an improving market, with light vehicle engine production up 14% and light truck production up 26% compared to 2016. At present, we expect further economic recovery in the region in 2018. Our full year 2018 outlook has light truck production increasing 5 to 21% from 2017, with light vehicle engine production up 10 to 14% compared to this past year. The Asia Pacific markets have been relatively strong the past few years. Light truck production increased 8% in 2015 and was up another 14% in 2016, while light vehicle engine production increased 2% in 2015 and another 7% in 2016. Further production increases occurred this past year, with 2017 light truck production up 7% and light vehicle engine build up 4%. Our full year 2018 outlook for the Asia Pacific light vehicle markets is for continued strong production levels, with the light truck segment up 1 to 5% from 2017 and light engine production being comparable to up 2%.\nMedium/heavy vehicle markets - Some of the same factors referenced above that affected light vehicle markets outside of North America similarly affected the medium/heavy markets. A strengthening European market the past three years contributed to medium/heavy truck production increasing 9% in 2015, 7% in 2016 and another 5% in 2017. Our 2018 full year outlook anticipates continued strong production at levels relatively comparable with 2017. A weakening South America economic climate beginning in 2014 led to medium/heavy truck production declining 47% in 2015 and another 20% in 2016. As with the light vehicle markets, improving economic conditions in the region led to medium/heavy truck production in 2017 being up about 28% from the preceding year. We expect that continued economic recovery in 2018 will contribute to comparable to higher medium/truck production in 2018. As such, our 2018 outlook currently anticipates comparable to higher production of around 12% when compared to 2017. A stronger than expected China market and an improving India market contributed to increases in medium/heavy truck production in the Asia Pacific region of about 20% in 2016 and another 23% in 2017 when\ncompared with the preceding year. This past year's strong demand was driven in part by impending regulations in China that limit axle load and weight which accelerated buying during the second half of 2016 and into 2017 prior to the new regulations becoming effective. With some pre-buy in China in 2017 likely reducing 2018 purchases, our 2018 production outlook expects aggregate production in the region to be comparable to down 9% from 2017.\nOff-Highway Markets - Our off-highway business has a large presence outside of North America, with approximately 75% of its sales coming from Europe and 15% from South America and Asia Pacific combined. We serve several segments of the diverse off-highway market, including construction, agriculture, mining and material handling. Our largest markets are the construction/mining and agricultural equipment segments which have been relatively weak over the past few years. Global demand in the agriculture market was down about 11% in 2014, 7% in 2015 and 5% in 2016. The construction/mining segment weakened about 4% in 2014, 11% in 2015 and 3% in 2016. These markets began to rebound in 2017 along with general economic recovery in several global markets, and in particular the European markets where this segment has a significant presence. During 2017, global production levels in the construction/mining and agriculture segments increased by about 8% and 2%. Consistent with expectations for improving global economic conditions, we expect that off-highway market demand will increase in 2018. Our 2018 outlook has production in the construction/mining segment increasing about 1 to 7% and the agriculture segment being down 1% to up 5% from 2017.\nForeign Currency\nWith 55% of our sales coming from outside the U.S., international currency movements can have a significant effect on our sales and results of operations. The euro zone countries, Brazil, Thailand, Mexico and China accounted for approximately 44%, 8%, 8%, 7% and 7% of our non-U.S. sales in 2017. Although sales in Argentina and South Africa are each less than 5% of our non-U.S. sales, exchange rate movements of those countries have been volatile and significantly impacted sales from time to time. Translation of our international activities at average exchange rates in 2015 as compared to average rates in 2014 reduced sales by $516, with $268 attributable to a weaker euro and $91 to a weaker Brazilian real. In 2016, weaker international currencies reduced sales by another $173. A weaker Argentine peso, British pound, Mexican peso, South African rand and Brazilian real reduced sales by $70, $23, $19, $18 and $11, while the euro was relatively stable in 2016. International currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar in 2017, increasing 2017 sales by $54. A stronger euro, Brazilian real, Thai baht and South African rand more than offset a weaker Argentine peso. Based on our current sales and exchange rate outlook for 2018, we expect overall stability in international currencies with a modest reduction to sales. At sales levels in our current outlook for 2018, a 5% movement on the euro would impact our annual sales by approximately $100. A 5% change on the Brazilian real, Thai baht, Mexican peso and Chinese yuan rates would impact our annual sales in each of those countries by approximately $10 to $20.\nInternational Markets\nThe United Kingdom's decision to exit the European Union (\"Brexit\") has provided some uncertainty and potential volatility around European currencies, along with uncertain effects of future trade and other cross-border activities of the United Kingdom with the European Union and other countries. Similarly, with new government leadership in the U.S. assuming control in early 2017, there is added uncertainly around future economic and trade policy and its potential impact on the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies as well as its direct impact on trade with other countries.\nThe Brazil market is an important market for our Commercial Vehicle segment, representing about 19% of this segment's 2017 sales. Our medium/heavy truck sales in Brazil account for approximately 77% of our total sales in the country. Reduced market demand resulting from the weak economic environment in Brazil in 2015 led to production levels in the light vehicle and medium/heavy duty truck markets that were lower by about 22% and 44% from 2014. Continued weakness in 2016 resulted in further reductions in medium/heavy truck production of about 20% and a light vehicle production decline of around 10%. As a consequence, sales by our operations in Brazil for 2016 approximated $200, down from about $500 in 2014. In response to the challenging economic conditions in this country, we implemented restructuring and other cost reduction actions and reduced costs to the extent practicable. As discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we completed a transaction in December 2016 that provided us with the underlying assets and personnel supporting our pre-existing business with a supplier along with some incremental business. With this transaction, we have enhanced our competitive position in the market and should benefit significantly in future years as the Brazilian markets rebound. The Brazilian economy has rebounded in 2017, leading to increased medium/heavy truck and light truck production of more than 25% from 2016. Further economic improvement and increased production is expected in 2018.\nCommodity Costs\nThe cost of our products may be significantly impacted by changes in raw material commodity prices, the most important to us being those of various grades of steel, aluminum, copper and brass. The effects of changes in commodity prices are reflected directly in our purchases of commodities and indirectly through our purchases of products such as castings, forgings, bearings and component parts that include commodities. Most of our major customer agreements provide for the sharing of significant commodity price changes with those customers. Where such formal agreements are not present, we have historically been successful implementing price adjustments that largely compensate for the inflationary impact of material costs. Material cost changes will customarily have some impact on our financial results as customer pricing adjustments typically lag commodity price changes.\nOur costs in 2017 and 2016 increased on a year-over-year basis by approximately $70 and $8 due to higher commodity costs, while lower commodity prices reduced year-over-year costs in 2015 by $10. During 2017, material recovery actions increased sales by $57 while other pricing actions reduced sales by $46, yielding a net year-over-year sales increase of $11. Material cost recovery and pricing actions increased sales by $10 in 2016 and $1 in 2015.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nIn December 2017, the U.S. introduced broad ranging tax reform with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Act\") legislation. Among the tax reforms was a reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Historically, we've recognized deferred tax assets for items providing future reductions of taxable income. These deferred tax assets are valued based on the corporate tax rate expected to be available when the deductions are taken. With enactment of the lower corporate tax rate in 2017, we've taken a charge to tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reduce the value of these assets. The effect of the rate reduction on deferred tax assets in combination with other provisions of the Act resulted in a net non-cash increase in 2017 income tax expense of $186. Among the tax reform provisions was a transitional U.S. tax, or toll charge, assessed on undistributed earnings of foreign operations. We were able to utilize existing tax attributes to offset this transitional tax liability. As such, adoption of the Act's provisions did not give rise to any cash taxes.\nBeyond 2017, the lower corporate tax rate will benefit our results of operations in the form of reduced tax expense. Although the reduced tax rate will benefit earnings, there is not likely to be a corresponding reduction of cash taxes. We have net operating loss carryforwards that are utilized to offset U.S. cash tax obligations, likely over the next several years. With implementation of a territorial tax system and exclusion of foreign subsidiary dividends from taxation in the U.S., we believe the Act will provide some greater flexibility to repatriate future earnings of our foreign operations.\nSales, Earnings and Cash Flow Outlook\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\nOutlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales\n</td> <td>$7,500 - $7,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$910 - $960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>652\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>~7.5% of Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>406\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>~4.0% of Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free Cash Flow\n</td> <td>~3.5% of Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>146\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures discussion below for definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measures. We have not provided a reconciliation of our adjusted EBITDA outlook to the most comparable GAAP measure of net income. Providing net income guidance is potentially misleading and not practical given the difficulty of projecting event driven transactional and other non-core operating items that are included in net income, including restructuring actions, asset impairments and certain income tax adjustments. The accompanying reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with the most comparable GAAP measures for the historical periods presented are indicative of the reconciliations that will be prepared upon completion of the periods covered by the non-GAAP guidance.\nWe experienced declines in total sales in 2015 and 2016 due to weaker international currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. For these two years combined, currency translation effects reduced sales by $689. Adjusted for currency and divestiture effects, sales in these years were relatively comparable, with new customer programs largely offsetting the impacts of overall weaker end user demand across our global businesses. We experienced uneven end user markets, with some being relatively strong and\nothers somewhat weak, and the conditions across the regions of the world differing quite dramatically. In 2017, international currencies were relatively stable, providing a $54 benefit to sales. The increase in 2017 sales of 24% was driven primarily by acquisitions and stronger market demand. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added $500 of sales, while stronger market demand and contributions from new customer programs increased sales by $829 - an organic increase of 14%. Our 2018 sales outlook is $7,500 to $7,700, with the sales growth coming principally from our new business backlog that is expected to contribute about $300 to 2018 sales. A full year of sales from our 2017 acquisitions and net pick-up in overall market demand is expected to also contribute increased sales in 2018, while we expect currency effects to again be relatively stable with this past year.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin as a percent of sales remained relatively constant at around 11% in 2016 and 2015 despite certain markets being weak and volatile. We continue to focus on margin improvement through right sizing and rationalizing our manufacturing operations, leveraging resources across the global organization, implementing other cost reduction initiatives and ensuring that customer programs are competitively priced. We achieved Adjusted EBITDA margin growth in 2017 as we benefited from the operating leverage attributable to increased sales volumes, while at the same time digesting and integrating several acquisitions. At our current sales outlook for 2018, we expect full year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA to approximate $910 to $960. Margin in 2018 is expected to exceed 12%, as we benefit from higher margin net new business, improve cost performance and realize synergies from the integration of our recent acquisitions, more than offsetting the increased investment we expect to make in 2018 to support our electrification strategy initiatives.\nWe have generated positive free cash flow in recent years while increasing capital spending to support organic business growth through launching new business with customers. Free cash flow in 2015 declined from the previous year due to lower earnings and increased capital spend to support new program launches, with lower cash taxes and restructuring payments providing a partial offset. Reduced free cash flow in 2016 was primarily attributable to our continued success in being awarded significant new customer programs. Although many of the recent program wins were not scheduled to begin production until 2018, certain of these programs required capital investment beginning in 2016. As such, cash used for capital investments in 2016 was $62 higher than in 2015. As planned, an elevated level of capital spending at around 5.5% of sales continued into 2017 to support new customer programs. Despite an increase in capital spending of $71 in 2017, free cash increased by $99, primarily from a stronger earnings performance which contributed to increased operating cash flows of $170. With the required capital to support new programs beginning to dissipate and return to more typical levels over the next couple years. We expect capital spend in 2018 will be around 4% of sales. Operating cash flows in 2018 are expected to again be around 7.5% of sales. A continued growth in earnings is expected to benefit 2018 operating cash flows along with a reduced amount of one-time transaction-related cash expenditures that were incurred in 2017 to facilitate acquisitions completed this past year. Partially offsetting the benefit from higher earnings and lower transaction expenditures is an expected higher level of cash taxes and working capital investment. With a comparable level of operating cash flows relative to sales in 2018, the reduction in capital spending is expected to provide free cash flow of about 3.5% of sales - an increase of about $100 from the 2.2% of sales generated in 2017.\nAmong our Operational and Strategic Initiatives are increased focus on and investment in product technology - delivering products and technology that are key to bringing solutions to issues of paramount importance to our customers. Our success on this front is measured, in part, by our sales backlog - net new business received that will be launching in the future and adding to our base annual sales. This backlog excludes replacement business and represents incremental sales associated with new programs for which we have received formal customer awards. At December 31, 2017, our sales backlog of net new business for the 2018 through 2020 period was $800, a 7% increase from the $750 three-year sales backlog that existed at the end of 2016. The increased three-year sales backlog at December 31, 2017 reflects continued new business wins, as the expected impact of revised market volumes and currency effects were minimal.\nConsolidated

Stronger international currencies increased sales by $54. The acquisitions of BFP, BPT, SIFCO, USM - Warren and Magnum in 2016 and 2017 generated a year-over-year increase in sales of $542, with the divestiture of Nippon Reinz resulting in a reduction of $42. The organic sales increase of $829 resulted primarily from stronger light truck markets, strengthening global off-highway demand, stronger medium/heavy truck markets in Europe and South America, and contributions from new business.\nThe North America sales increase from acquisitions in 2017 relates primarily to the USM - Warren purchase, with a lesser amount being added by the BFP, BPT and Magnum transactions. The organic sales increase of 14% was driven principally by stronger production levels on certain of our key light truck programs, with stronger medium/heavy truck production and off-highway demand levels also providing some contribution.\nExcluding currency effects and the increase in sales of $294 attributable to the BFP and BPT acquisitions, 2017 sales in Europe were 13% higher than in 2016. Stronger off-highway market demands were a primary driver of the organic sales increase, although each of our operating segments experienced increased organic sales, primarily from higher production/demand levels.\nIn South America, 2017 sales benefited from a stronger Brazil real, however, that was largely offset by a weaker Argentina peso. The acquisition-related sales increase resulted from the SIFCO and BPT acquisitions. Excluding these effects, sales were\nup 31% from 2016. The organic sales increase in the region was driven largely by stronger 2017 production levels, with light truck and medium/heavy truck production each up more than 25% from the preceding year.\nAsia Pacific sales in 2017 were 17% higher than 2016. Sales increased by $67 from the BPT and BFP acquisitions, more than offsetting the $42 reduction attributable to the Nippon-Reinz divestiture. Sales in this region also benefited from a stronger India rupee and Thailand baht. The organic sales increase of 11% in this region was due primarily to stronger light vehicle production levels and off-highway market demand, along with contributions from new customer programs.\nCost of sales and gross margin - Cost of sales for 2017 increased $1,165, or 23%, when compared to 2016. Similar to the factors affecting sales, the increase was primarily due to higher overall sales volumes and the inclusion of acquired businesses. Cost of sales attributed to net acquisitions, which included $14 of incremental cost assigned to inventory as part of business combination accounting, amounted to $423, or 84.8% of the sales of those businesses. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures, cost of sales as a percent of sales declined from 85.5% of sales in 2016 to 85.3% of sales in 2017 - a reduction of 20 basis points. This reduction in cost of sales as a percent of sales was largely attributable to better fixed cost absorption on the higher production volume. Cost of sales also benefited from material cost savings of approximately $67 and a reduction in warranty expense of $8. The benefit from higher production levels and other items was partially offset by increased material commodity prices of $70, start-up/launch costs of $30 and engineering and development expense of $24.\nGross margin of $1,062 for 2017 increased $218 from 2016. Gross margin as a percent of sales was 14.7% in 2017, 20 basis points higher than in 2016. Acquisitions net of divestitures added $76 of gross margin. The margin improvement as a percent of sales was driven principally by the cost of sales factors referenced above.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) - SG&A expenses in 2017 were $511 (7.1% of sales) as compared to $406 (7.0% of sales) in 2016. SG&A attributed to net acquisitions was $73. Excluding the increase associated with acquisitions and divestitures, SG&A expenses as a percent of sales were 6.5% of sales, 50 basis points lower than the same period of 2016. The $32 year-over-year increase exclusive of net acquisitions was principally due to an increase in salary and benefits expenses of $41 primarily relating to increased compensation expense resulting from better performance in relation to incentive targets in 2017. Selling costs and other discretionary spending were $9 lower than in 2016.\nAmortization of intangibles - The increase of $3 in amortization expense was primarily attributable to amortization of the intangibles acquired in the acquisitions completed in late 2016 and the first quarter of 2017.\nRestructuring charges, net - During 2017, we approved additional plans to implement certain headcount reduction initiatives in our Off-Highway business as part of the BPT and BFP acquisition integration, resulting in the recognition of $14, primarily for severance and benefits costs, during 2017. Including costs associated with the newly approved actions during 2017 and costs associated with previously announced initiatives, net of the reversal described below, restructuring expense during 2017 was $14. During the fourth quarter of 2017, in response to better-than-expected market recovery in our Off-Highway business in Europe, management re-evaluated the economic conditions of our global Off-Highway business and determined that a portion of the previously approved 2016 restructuring program is no longer economically prudent. This change in facts and circumstances led to the decision to reverse $8 of previously accrued liabilities. Restructuring charges of $36 in 2016 included $14 of costs attributable to headcount reductions in our Off-Highway segment and $10 for headcount reductions in our Brazil Commercial Vehicle business that were taken in connection with our acquisition of the SIFCO business. The remaining amount was attributable to the planned closure of our Commercial Vehicle manufacturing facility in Glasgow, Kentucky, headcount reduction actions at our corporate facilities in the U.S. and employee separation and exit costs associated with previously announced actions.\nLoss on disposal group held for sale - Reference is made to Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of the pending divestiture of our Brazil suspension components business.\nLoss on sale of subsidiaries - Reference is made to Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of the 2016 divestitures of DCLLC and Nippon Reinz.\nOther income (expense), net - The following table shows the major components of other income (expense), net.\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Government grants and incentives\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange loss\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Strategic transaction expenses\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance and other recoveries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of marketable securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts attributable to previously divested/closed operations\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe higher level of strategic transaction expenses in 2017 is primarily attributable to costs incurred in connection with acquiring and integrating the BFP, BPT and USM businesses beginning in the first quarter of 2017. Amounts attributable to previously divested/closed operations in 2017 includes the receipt of the remaining proceeds on our December 2016 divestiture of DCLLC. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information. In 2016, DCLLC received a recovery of $8 of costs previously incurred on behalf of other participants in a consortium that existed to administer certain legacy personal injury claims and realized gains of $7 from the sale of portfolio investments.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt - As discussed in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we redeemed $100 of our September 2021 Notes, repaid indebtedness of our BPT and BFP subsidiaries and repaid certain bank debt in Brazil during the second quarter of 2017, and we redeemed the remaining $350 of our September 2021 Notes in this year's third quarter. We incurred redemption premiums of $15 in connection with these repayments and wrote off $4 of previously deferred financing costs associated with the debt that was extinguished. In the second quarter of 2016, we redeemed our February 2021 Notes, incurring a redemption premium of $12, and also restructured our domestic revolving credit facility. In connection with these transactions, we wrote off $5 of previously deferred financing costs.\nInterest income and interest expense - Interest income was $11 in 2017 and $13 in 2016. Interest expense was $102 in 2017 and $113 in 2016. A lower average interest rate on borrowings was partially offset by higher average debt levels in 2017. Average debt levels were higher in 2017 in part due to debt of $181 assumed in connection with the acquisition of BFP and BPT. As discussed in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we completed several financing transactions since May 2016 which in combination with cross-currency swaps effectively resulted in euro-denominated obligations at lower interest rates. Average effective interest rates, inclusive of amortization of debt issuance costs, approximated 5.5% and 6.5% in 2017 and 2016.\nIncome tax expense (benefit) - Income taxes were an expense of $283 in 2017 and a benefit of $424 in 2016. With the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act occurring in December 2017 in the U.S., provisions of this tax reform legislation were required to be recognized in 2017. The most significant 2017 impact of this legislation was the reduction of net deferred tax assets to reflect expected realization at the lower U.S. corporate tax rate of 21% rather than the previous rate of 35%. The net impact of recognizing the required elements of the new tax reform legislation was an increase in tax expense of $186. During 2017, continued improvement in our profit outlook enabled us to release $27 of valuation allowances on state deferred tax assets. In 2016, we determined that most of the valuation allowances against U.S. deferred taxes were no longer required. Release of these valuation allowances resulted in a $501 income tax benefit. Additionally, developments in Brazil led to our assessment that an allowance against certain deferred taxes in that country was appropriate, and we recognized tax expense of $25 to establish this valuation allowance. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II for further disclosures around these items.\nExcluding the effects of the items referenced in the preceding paragraph, our effective tax rates were 33% in 2017 and 24% in 2016. These rates vary from the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% in these periods primarily due to valuation allowances in several countries and lower statutory tax rates outside the U.S. In 2016, a benefit of $58 for a reduction of accrued taxes on earnings of foreign operations resulting from legal entity restructuring and a revised determination as to permanent reinvestment contributed to a lower effective tax rate. These benefits were offset by tax expense of $17 on dividends and other income attributable to foreign operations, $30 of expense recognized to establish provisions associated with uncertain tax positions and $11 of amortization of a prepaid tax asset that was written off to retained earnings on January 1, 2017 in connection with the adoption of new guidance relating to intra-entity transfers. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II for further disclosure around the adoption of the new intra-entity transfer guidance.\nIn countries where our history of operating losses does not allow us to satisfy the more likely than not\u201d criterion for\nrecognition of deferred tax assets, we have generally recognized no income tax on the pre-tax income or losses as valuation allowance adjustments offset the associated tax effects. Following the release of valuation allowances on our U.S. deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2016, tax effects relating to U.S. income in 2017 are no longer being offset by adjustments to the valuation allowance. We believe that it is reasonably possible that a valuation allowance of up to $8 related to a subsidiary in Argentina will be released in the next twelve months.\nEquity in earnings of affiliates - Net earnings from equity investments was $19 in 2017 compared with $14 in 2016. Equity in earnings from BSFB was $9 in 2017 and $7 in 2016. Equity in earnings from DDAC was $9 in 2017, inclusive of a $4 charge for asset transfer and conversion of certain assets, and $7 in 2016.\nNoncontrolling interests net income - The reduced level of earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests is generally attributable to reduced earnings of the consolidated operations that are less than wholly-owned. The reduction in 2017 was due, in part, to increased tax expense in 2017 associated with planned legal entity restructuring. The redeemable noncontrolling interest relates to the acquisition of BFP and BPT in the first quarter of 2017 on which we have call options as described more fully in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nSegment Results of Operations (2017 versus 2016)\nLight Vehicle\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\nEBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\nEBITDA\nMargin\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Volume and mix\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Performance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Currency effects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLight Vehicle sales in 2017, exclusive of currency and the increased sales from the acquisition of USM - Warren on March 1 of this year, were 18% higher than 2016. The volume-related sales increase was driven primarily by stronger production levels, content increases and favorable model mix on certain of our significant full frame light truck programs in North America, resulting in sales growth that exceeded overall higher 2017 North America full frame light truck production of 3%. Sales in this segment also benefited from increased production levels in Europe, South America and Asia Pacific and new customer programs, including the transfer of a program previously supported by our Commercial Vehicle segment that moved to Light Vehicle in mid-2016 when the axle used to support the program was replaced with an axle produced by the Light Vehicle segment. This program increased Light Vehicle 2017 sales by approximately $50. Customer pricing and cost recovery impacts increased sales by $14.\nLight Vehicle segment EBITDA increased by $80 in 2017. Higher sales volumes provided a benefit of $92, while the acquisition of USM - Warren contributed $12. The year-over-year performance-related earnings reduction in 2017 was driven by $37 of increased commodity costs and $30 of incremental new program start-up and launch-related costs. Partially offsetting these higher costs were pricing and material recovery actions that increased segment EBITDA by $14 and material cost initiatives that provided increased savings of $32. The remaining performance-related reduction of $1 was attributable to higher engineering investment and increased incentive compensation net of other earnings improvement actions.\nCommercial Vehicle\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\nEBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\nEBITDA\nMargin\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Volume and mix\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Performance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Currency effects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCurrency effects which increased sales in 2017 were primarily due to a stronger euro and Brazilian real. The increased sales from acquisition in 2017 relate to the purchase of SIFCO business late in 2016, as described above. After adjusting for the effects of currency and acquisitions, sales in our Commercial Vehicle segment increased 7% in 2017. The volume-related increase was primarily attributable to higher production levels in North America, where Class 8 production was up 12% and Classes 5-7 production was up 6%. Also contributing to the higher sales volume were production increases of 28% in South America and 5% in Europe. Partially offsetting the increased production levels was the transfer of a program having sales of about $50 to the Light Vehicle segment which began supplying the axle for the program in mid-2016.\nCommercial Vehicle segment EBITDA increased by $20 in 2017. Although sales benefited from currency translation, segment EBITDA was negatively impacted by currency transaction losses. Higher sales volumes increased 2017 earnings by $20. The performance-related improvement in segment EBITDA resulted primarily from pricing and material recovery actions which provided a benefit of $12, a reduction in warranty expense of $8 and material cost savings actions of $12, more than offsetting increases in material commodity costs of $14 and in incentive compensation and other costs of $12.\nOff-Highway\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\nEBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\nEBITDA\nMargin\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Volume and mix\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Performance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Currency effects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe operations of the BFP and BPT businesses acquired on February 1, 2017 added $401 to this segment's sales in 2017. Currency effects provided higher sales of $19, principally due to a stronger euro compared to 2016. After adjusting for these two items, sales in 2017 were higher by 21%, reflecting significantly higher global end-market demand.\nOff-Highway 2017 segment EBITDA increased by $83, with the BFP and BPT operations contributing $40 and higher sales volumes providing an increase of $41. Year-over-year performance-related earnings in 2017 were reduced by increased engineering and development expenses of $14, lower pricing, net of material recovery, of $10, and higher commodity costs of $6. Substantially offsetting these reductions to earnings were material cost savings of $13 and improved earnings from restructuring and other cost savings actions..\nPower Technologies\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\nEBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\nEBITDA\nMargin\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Volume and mix\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Divestiture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Performance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Currency effects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPower Technologies primarily serves the light vehicle market but also sells product to the medium/heavy truck and off-highway markets. Net of currency effects and the reduction in sales resulting from the Nippon Reinz divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2016, sales in 2017 increased 7%, primarily due to overall stronger market demand and new customer programs.\nSegment EBITDA increased by $10 in 2017, with higher sales volumes providing an earnings benefit of $26 and the divestiture of Nippon Reinz reducing earnings by $5. A reduction of $12 in year-over-year third performance-related earnings was driven by higher commodity costs of $13, customer pricing reductions of $5 and other net cost increases of $4.

2015. Weaker international currencies decreased sales by $173. The acquisition of Magnum earlier this year added sales of $7, with the divestiture of Nippon Reinz at the end of November 2016 reducing sales by $3. A volume-related organic sales decrease of $75 resulted primarily from weaker global Off-Highway demand, lower commercial vehicle production in North America and Brazil and lower sales with a major North America commercial vehicle customer, partially offset by stronger overall light vehicle volume levels in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific and contributions from new customer programs. Cost recovery pricing actions increased sales by $10.\nThe North America organic sales reduction of 2% was driven principally by a decline in Class 8 production of about 30%, reduced sales levels with a major commercial vehicle customer and weaker Off-Highway demand. These effects were partially offset by growth in full frame light truck production of around 7%, an increase in light vehicle engine build of 4% and higher sales from new customer programs.\nExcluding currency effects, principally from a weaker South African rand and British pound, our 2016 sales in Europe were 4% lower than in 2015. Weaker Off-Highway demand was the primary driver of this reduction in sales, with increased light vehicle engine and light truck production providing a partial offset.\nSouth America sales in 2016 were impacted by weaker currencies in Argentina and Brazil. Excluding these effects, sales were up 11% from 2015. The organic sales increase in the region was driven largely by pricing actions, primarily recovery of inflationary cost increases in Argentina and contributions from new customer programs. These increases were partially offset by medium/heavy truck production levels being around 20% lower.\nAsia Pacific sales in 2016 were relatively comparable to those in the preceding year. Weaker currencies in Thailand, India and China contributed to the currency-related sales reduction. The 3% organic sales increase resulted primarily from increased production levels in the region along with new customer programs.\nCost of sales and gross margin - Cost of sales declined $229, or 4%, in 2016 when compared to 2015. Similar to the factors affecting sales, the reduction was primarily due to currency effects and lower overall sales volumes. Cost of sales as a percent of 2016 sales was 50 basis points lower than in the previous year. Underabsorption of costs as a result of lower sales volumes increased cost of sales as a percent of sales. Cost of sales in 2016 was also higher due to increases in engineering and product development costs of $13 and material commodity prices of $8 and incremental start-up/launch costs of $8. More than offsetting the margin impact of these increases were savings from lower material costs of $67 and avoidance of supplier transition costs in our Commercial Vehicle segment of $14 in 2015, and a decline in environmental remediation expense of $6.\nGross margin of $844 for 2016 decreased $5 from 2015. Gross margin as a percent of sales was 14.5% in 2016, 50 basis points higher than in 2015. Margin improvement was driven principally by the cost of sales factors referenced above.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) - SG&A expenses in 2016 were $406 (7.0% of sales) as compared to $391 (6.5% of sales) in 2015. Salary and benefits expenses in 2016 were $9 higher than in 2015, while selling and other discretionary spending increased $6, due in part to execution of certain strategic project initiatives.\nAmortization of intangibles - The reduction of $6 in amortization of intangibles was primarily attributable to certain customer related intangibles becoming fully amortized.\nRestructuring charges, net - Restructuring charges of $36 in 2016 included a fourth-quarter expense of $10 in conjunction with the SIFCO acquisition, as described above, to eliminate certain positions in our Brazil Commercial Vehicle business to align with expected market demand. Third-quarter 2016 expense included $14 for separation costs in connection with headcount reduction actions in our Off-Highway segment that were approved as a result of continuing weak demand levels in this business at that time. The remaining $12 of restructuring expense in 2016 relates to the closure of our Commercial Vehicle manufacturing facility in Glasgow, Kentucky, headcount reduction actions at our corporate facilities in the U.S., other headcount reductions in Brazil and employee separation and exit costs associated with previously announced headcount reduction and facility closure actions. Restructuring charges of $15 in 2015 were primarily attributable to headcount reductions in our Commercial Vehicle business in Brazil which were significantly impacted by lower demand levels, along with costs associated with previously announced restructuring actions.\nLoss on sale of subsidiaries - Reference is made to Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of the fourth-quarter 2016 divestitures of DCLLC and Nippon Reinz.\nImpairment of long-lived assets - Reference is made to Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for discussion of charges recognized in connection with an impairment of long-lived assets attributable to an exclusive supply relationship with a South American supplier.\nOther income, net - The following table shows the major components of other income, net.\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Government grants and incentives\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange loss\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on derecognition of noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Strategic transaction expenses\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance and other recoveries\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of marketable securities\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts attributable to previously divested/closed operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2015, foreign exchange losses were primarily driven by the impact the strengthening U.S. dollar had on our Mexican peso and euro forward contracts. Upon completion of the divestiture of our operations in Venezuela in January 2015, we recognized a $5 gain on the derecognition of the noncontrolling interest in one of our former Venezuelan subsidiaries. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II for additional information. The increase in strategic transaction expenses in 2016 is primarily attributable to an increased level of inorganic growth opportunities that were being pursued, including the SIFCO acquisition that closed in December 2016 and the BFP and BPT acquisitions that closed in February 2017. Additionally, we incurred transactional costs in connection with the divestitures of DCLLC and Nippon Reinz. See Notes 2 and 3 for additional information. During 2016, we received a recovery of $8 of costs previously incurred on behalf of other participants in a consortium that existed to administer certain legacy personal injury claims. During 2015, we reached a settlement with an insurance carrier for the recovery of previously incurred legal costs.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt - During the second quarter of 2016, we redeemed our February 2021 Notes and incurred a redemption premium of $12. We also restructured our domestic revolving credit facility. In connection with these actions, we wrote off $5 of previously deferred financing costs. The prior year expense was attributable to the call premium and write-off of previously deferred financing costs associated with the redemption of $15 of our February 2019 Notes in the first quarter of 2015.\nInterest income and interest expense - Interest income was $13 in both 2016 and 2015. Interest expense was $113 in both 2016 and 2015. A lower average interest rate on borrowings was offset by higher average debt levels in 2016. As discussed in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II, Dana Financing Luxembourg S.\u00e0 r.l. issued $375 of its June 2026 Notes on May 27, 2016 and we redeemed $350 of our February 2021 Notes on June 23, 2016. In conjunction with the issuance of the June 2026 Notes, we entered into two 10-year fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps which have the effect of economically converting the June 2026 Notes to euro-denominated debt at a fixed rate of 5.140%. Average effective interest rates, inclusive of amortization of debt issuance costs, approximated 6.5% and 6.6% in 2016 and 2015.\nIncome tax expense (benefit) - Income taxes were a benefit of $424 in 2016, whereas we had a tax expense of $82 in 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined that most of the valuation allowances against U.S. deferred taxes were no longer required. Release of these valuation allowances resulted in a $501 income tax benefit. Additionally, developments in Brazil led to our determination that an allowance against certain deferred taxes in that country was appropriate, and we recognized tax expense of $25 to establish this valuation allowance. During 2015, we completed an intercompany transfer of an affiliate's stock and certain operating assets. In connection with this transaction, we released $66 of valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets and recognized $23 of tax expense related to the stock sale and $2 of amortization of a prepaid tax asset created as part of the transaction. Amortization of the prepaid tax asset in 2016 was $11. In 2015, we also established a valuation allowance of $15 against the deferred tax assets of a subsidiary in Brazil. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II for further disclosures around these valuation allowance adjustments.\nThe effective income tax rates vary from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to valuation allowances in several countries, nondeductible expenses, different statutory rates outside the U.S. and withholding taxes. Contributing to the lower effective rate in 2016 were benefits of $58 for a reduction of accrued taxes on earnings of foreign operations resulting from legal entity restructuring and a revised determination as to permanent reinvestment. Partially offsetting this benefit was tax expense of $17 on dividends and other income attributable to foreign operations, and $30 of expense recognized to establish provisions associated with uncertain tax positions. Excluding the effects of the items described above, the effective tax rate was 24% in 2016 and 37% in 2015. In 2016, jurisdictions with effective tax rates less than the U.S. tax rate of 35% decreased the overall effective rate. In 2015, jurisdictions with valuation allowances had lower pre-tax income, which increased the effective rate.\nIn the U.S. and certain other countries, where our history of operating losses did not allow us to satisfy the more likely than not\u201d criterion for recognition of deferred tax assets, we have generally recognized no income tax on the pre-tax income or losses in these jurisdictions as valuation allowance adjustments offset the associated tax effects. With the release of valuation allowances on our U.S. deferred tax assets in 2016, the future impact of valuation allowance adjustments will be less significant, resulting in tax expense that will be more reflective of a customary global effective tax rate.\nEquity in earnings (losses) of affiliates - Net earnings from equity investments was $14 in 2016 and a net loss of $34 in 2015. Equity in earnings from Bendix Spicer Foundation Brake, LLC (BSFB) were $7 in 2016 and $11 in 2015. Our share of Dongfeng Dana Axle Co., Ltd. (DDAC) operating results were $7 in 2016 and a loss of $7 in 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we determined that we had an other-than-temporary decrease in the carrying value of our DDAC investment and recorded a $39 impairment charge. See Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nIncome from discontinued operations - Income (loss) from discontinued operations activity relates to our Structural Products business. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nNoncontrolling interests net income - As more fully discussed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, the first quarter of 2015 included $9 for correction of previously reported noncontrolling interests net income.\nSegment Results of Operations (2016 versus 2015)\nLight Vehicle\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\nEBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\nEBITDA\nMargin\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Volume and mix\n</td> <td>235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Performance\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Currency effects\n</td> <td>(141\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLight Vehicle sales in 2016 were reduced by currency translation effects, primarily as a result of a weaker Mexico peso, Argentina peso, Thailand baht, South Africa rand and British pound sterling. Sales, exclusive of currency effects, were 11% higher than in 2015. The volume-related increases were driven primarily by stronger production levels. North America full frame light truck production in 2016 was up 7%, while light truck production in Europe and Asia Pacific was stronger by 9% and 12% compared to 2015. Sales in this segment also benefited from new customer programs, including $45 relating to a program previously supported by our Commercial Vehicle segment that moved to Light Vehicle in 2016 when the axle used to support the program was replaced with an axle produced by the Light Vehicle segment. Cost recovery actions, including inflationary cost recovery in Argentina, were the primary drivers of the sales increase categorized as performance.\nLight Vehicle segment EBITDA of $279 in 2016 was $17 higher than in the same period of 2015. Higher sales volumes from overall stronger production levels and new business provided a benefit of $37, while weaker international currencies reduced segment EBITDA by $16. The year-over-year performance-related earnings reduction was driven partly by an increase in material commodity costs of $16, higher warranty costs of $7, start-up and launch-related costs of $10, an increase in engineering and product development expense, net of customer recoveries, of $9 and inflationary and other cost increases of $17. Partially offsetting these factors which reduced segment EBITDA were cost recovery pricing actions of $31 and savings from material cost initiatives of $24.\nCommercial Vehicle\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\nEBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\nEBITDA\nMargin\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Volume and mix\n</td> <td>(265\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Performance\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Currency effects\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCurrency effects which reduced sales in 2016 were primarily due to a year-over-year weaker Brazil real and Mexico peso. After adjusting for the effects of currency, 2016 sales in our Commercial Vehicle segment decreased 17% compared to 2015. The volume-related reduction was primarily attributable to lower sales in North America where Class 8 production was down about 30%, a program having sales of $45 was transfered to the Light Vehicle segment who began supplying the axle for the program, and our share of sales with a major customer declined. Weaker end market demand in Brazil also contributed to lower sales volumes, with 2016 medium/heavy truck production being down about 20%.\nCommercial Vehicle segment EBITDA of $96 was $4 lower than in 2015. Lower sales volumes reduced 2016 segment EBITDA by $52. Largely offsetting the effects of lower volume was improved year-over-year performance-related segment EBITDA of $52, resulting from material cost savings of $15, avoidance of supplier transition costs of $14 incurred in 2015, a decline in warranty expense of $8, pricing actions of $3 and other net cost reductions of $12.\nOff-Highway\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\nEBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\nEBITDA\nMargin\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Volume and mix\n</td> <td>(110\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Performance\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Currency effects\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCurrency-adjusted 2016 sales were down 12% compared to 2015, primarily from lower global end-market demand.\nOff-Highway segment EBITDA of $129 in 2016 was down $18 from 2015.

Although performance-related segment EBITDA in 2016 benefited by $17 from lower material commodity costs and other material cost savings, those benefits were more than offset by $13 of pricing actions, higher engineering and development expense of $4 and other net cost increases of $6.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe have defined adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, equity grant expense, restructuring expense and other adjustments not related to our core operations (gain/loss on debt extinguishment, pension settlements, divestitures, impairment, etc.). Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of our ability to maintain and continue to invest in our operations and provide shareholder returns. We use adjusted EBITDA in assessing the effectiveness of our business strategies, evaluating and pricing potential acquisitions and as a factor in making incentive compensation decisions. In addition to its use by management, we also believe adjusted EBITDA is a measure widely used by securities analysts, investors and others to evaluate financial performance of our company relative to other Tier 1 automotive suppliers. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for earnings before income taxes, net income or other results reported in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA.\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(424\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>292\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>174\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Restructuring charges, net\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other*\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>652\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*\n</td> <td>Other includes stock compensation expense, strategic transaction expenses, gain on derecognition of noncontrolling interest, distressed supplier costs, amounts attributable to previously divested/closed operations, acquisition related inventory adjustments, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on sale of subsidiaries and other items.

We believe this measure is useful to investors in evaluating the operational cash flow of the company inclusive of the spending required to maintain the operations. Free cash flow is neither intended to represent nor be an alternative to the measure of net cash provided by operating activities reported under GAAP. Free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nThe following table reconciles net cash flows provided by operating activities to free cash flow.\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>406\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>(393\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(322\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(260\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>146\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents to liquidity, a non-GAAP measure, at December 31, 2017:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>603\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Less: Deposits supporting obligations\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available cash\n</td> <td>596\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additional cash availability from Revolving Facility\n</td> <td>578\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketable securities\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liquidity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash deposits are maintained to provide credit enhancement for certain agreements and are reported as part of cash and cash equivalents.

Several countries have local regulatory requirements that significantly restrict the ability of our operations to repatriate this cash. Beyond these restrictions, there are practical limitations on repatriation of cash from certain subsidiaries because of the resulting tax withholdings and subsidiary by-law restrictions which could limit our ability to access cash and other assets.\nThe principal sources of liquidity available for our future cash requirements are expected to be (i) cash flows from operations, (ii) cash and cash equivalents on hand and (iii) borrowings from our Revolving Facility. We believe that our overall liquidity and operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for capital expenditures, working capital, debt obligations, common stock repurchases and other commitments during the next twelve months. While uncertainty surrounding the current economic environment could adversely impact our business, based on our current financial position, we believe it is unlikely that any such effects would preclude us from maintaining sufficient liquidity.\nIn April 2017, Dana Financing Luxembourg S.\u00e0 r.l. completed the issuance of $400 of its April 2025 Notes. Net proceeds of the offering totaled $394. The proceeds from the offering were used to repay indebtedness of our BPT and BFP subsidiaries, repay indebtedness of a wholly-owned subsidiary in Brazil, redeem $100 of our September 2021 Notes and for general corporate purposes. The September 2021 Notes were redeemed on April 4, 2017 at a price equal to 104.031% plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nOn August 17, 2017, we entered into an amended credit and guaranty agreement comprised of a $275 term facility (the Term Facility) and a $600 revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility) both of which mature on August 17, 2022. On September 14, 2017, we drew the entire amount available under the Term Facility. Net proceeds from the Term Facility draw totaled $274. The proceeds from the Term Facility, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem the remaining $350 of our September 2021 Notes at a price equal to 102.688% plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility but we had utilized $22 for letters of credit. We had availability at December 31, 2017 under the Revolving Facility of $578 after deducting the outstanding letters of credit.\nAt December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the covenants of our financing agreements. Under the Revolving Facility and our senior notes, we are required to comply with certain incurrence-based covenants customary for facilities of these types. The incurrence-based covenants in the Revolving Facility permit us to, among other things, (i) issue foreign subsidiary indebtedness, (ii) incur general secured indebtedness subject to a pro forma first lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 1.50:1.00 in the case of first lien debt and a pro forma secured net leverage ratio of 2.50:1.00 in the case of other secured debt and (iii) incur additional unsecured debt subject to a pro forma total net leverage ratio not to exceed 3.50:1.00. We may also make dividend payments in respect of our common stock as well as certain investments and acquisitions subject to a pro forma total net leverage ratio of 2.75:1.00. In addition, the Revolving Facility is subject to a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a first lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 2.00:1.00. The indentures governing the senior notes include other incurrence-based covenants that may subject us to additional specified limitations.\nIn December 2017, our Board of Directors approved a new $100 common stock share repurchase program, which expires on December 31, 2019. We plan to repurchase shares utilizing available excess cash either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The stock repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, available growth opportunities and other considerations.\nFrom time to time, depending upon market, pricing and other conditions, as well as our cash balances and liquidity, we may seek to acquire our senior notes or other indebtedness or our common stock through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine (or as may be provided for in the indentures governing the notes), for cash, securities or other consideration. There can be no assurance that we will pursue any such transactions in the future, as the pursuit of any alternative will depend upon numerous factors such as market conditions, our financial performance and the limitations applicable to such transactions under our\nfinancing and governance documents.\nCash Flow\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used for changes in working capital\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(51\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(41\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other cash provided by operations\n</td> <td>562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>447\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>406\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(581\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(365\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(258\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>(120\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(88\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(403\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(147\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(69\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(255\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table above summarizes our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nOperating activities - Exclusive of working capital, other cash provided by operations was $562 during 2017 compared to $435 during 2016 and $447 during 2015. The increase in 2017 is principally due to an increased level of operating earnings in 2017. Partially offsetting the higher operating earnings was an increased cash use of $20 for acquisition-related costs, including costs incurred to complete the transactions and post-acquisition related integration costs. The decrease during 2016 was primarily attributable to a year-over-year increase in cash paid for interest of $15 and cash paid on the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts and swaps of $7, partially offset by higher operating earnings.\nWorking capital used cash of $8 in 2017, $51 in 2016 and $41 in 2015. Cash of $141 was used to finance increased receivables in 2017, with cash of $86 having been required in 2016 and receivables remaining unchanged in 2015. Higher inventories consumed cash of $146 in 2017, $13 in 2016 and $28 in 2015. Increases in accounts payable and other net liabilities provided cash of $279 in 2017 and $48 in 2016 while decreases in accounts payable and other net liabilities used cash of $13 in 2015. The higher level of cash used to finance increased receivables and inventory, and the partial offset resulting from higher levels of accounts payable and other liabilities, in 2017 is due primarily to the stronger volume levels experienced this past year. Exclusive of acquisitions, sales increased 15% in 2017, predominantly on the strength of stronger market demand and new customer programs. In addition to higher volume levels, the cash generated in 2017 from increased levels of accounts payable and other liabilities was also reflective of changes in payment practices and lengthening of payment terms with suppliers. The continued focus on receivable collections and inventory management combined with extending supplier terms and modifying payment practices, enabled us to use less cash overall for working capital in 2017 than 2016 despite the higher sales levels. The use of cash in 2016 for receivables reflected increased sales levels in November and December compared to 2015. Except for this increase in receivables in 2016, there were no significant uses or sources of cash from working capital components in 2016 and 2015 as organic sales levels were relatively comparable with the preceding years.\nInvesting activities - Expenditures for property plant and equipment were $393, $322, and $260 in 2017, 2016 and 2015. The higher level of capital spending the past two years has resulted from our increased new business sales backlog, reflecting our success with being awarded new customer programs. Additionally, two of our largest customer programs requiring new investment launched within the past two years. During 2017, we paid $106, net of cash acquired, to purchase an 80% ownership interest in BFP and BPT, and we used cash of $78 to acquire the USM - Warren business. During 2016, we paid $18 to acquire the aftermarket distribution business of Magnum and $60 to acquire the strategic assets of SIFCO's commercial vehicle steer axle systems and related forged components businesses. In 2016, we received net proceeds of $5 and $29 related to the sale of our Nippon Reinz and DCLLC subsidiaries. During all three years, purchases of marketable securities were largely funded by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities.\nFinancing activities - During 2017, our European subsidiary, Dana Financing Luxembourg S.\u00e0 r.l., completed the issuance of $400 of its April 2025 Notes and paid financing costs of $6 related to the notes. We paid financing costs of $3 related to our Term Facility and Revolving Facility and drew the entire $275 available under the Term Facility. We redeemed all $450 of our September 2021 Notes at a $14 premium, repaid indebtedness of a wholly-owned subsidiary in Brazil at a premium of $1 and repaid indebtedness of our BPT and BFP subsidiaries. In 2016, Dana Financing Luxembourg S.\u00e0 r.l. completed the issuance of $375 of its June 2026 Notes and paid financing costs of $7 related to the notes. We paid financing costs of $3 to enter our Revolving Facility and a premium of $12 to redeem all of our February 2021 Notes. Also during 2016, we made scheduled repayments of $32 and took out $66 of additional long-term debt at international locations. During 2015, we redeemed $55 of our February 2019 Notes at a $2 premium. We used cash of $81 and $311 to repurchase common shares under our share repurchase program in 2016 and 2015. We used $35, $35 and $37 for dividend payments to common stockholders in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Distributions to noncontrolling interests totaled $12, $17 and $9 in 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn connection with the divestiture of our Structural Products business in 2010, leases covering three U.S. facilities were assigned to a U.S. affiliate of the new owner, Metalsa S.A. de C.V. (Metalsa). Under the terms of the sale agreement, we guarantee the affiliate's performance under the leases, which run through June 2025, including approximately $6 of annual payments. In the event of a required payment by Dana as guarantor, we are entitled to pursue full recovery from Metalsa of the amounts paid under the guarantee and to take possession of the leased property.\nContractual Obligations\nWe are obligated to make future cash payments in fixed amounts under various agreements.

Based on information available to us at the present time, we do not believe that any liabilities beyond the amounts already accrued that may result from these contingencies will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to use estimates and make judgments and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. Considerable judgment is often involved in making these determinations. Critical estimates are those that\nrequire the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and the accompanying notes. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on a regular basis. We believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate. However, the use of different assumptions could result in significantly different results and actual results could differ from those estimates. The following discussion of accounting estimates is intended to supplement the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies presented as Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nIncome taxes - Accounting for income taxes is complex, in part because we conduct business globally and therefore file income tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the income tax provision, uncertain tax positions, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is provided when, in our judgment based upon available information, it is more likely than not that a portion of such deferred tax assets will not be realized. To make this assessment, we consider the historical and projected future taxable income or loss by tax jurisdiction. We consider all components of comprehensive income and weight the positive and negative evidence, putting greater reliance on objectively verifiable historical evidence than on projections of future profitability that are dependent on actions that have not taken place as of the assessment date. We also consider changes to historical profitability of actions that occurred through the date of assessment and objectively verifiable effects of material forecasted events that would have a sustained effect on future profitability, as well as the effect on historical profits of nonrecurring events. We also incorporate the changes to historical and prospective income from tax planning strategies expected to be implemented.\nTax reform legislation in the U.S. was signed into law in December 2017 with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Act\"). This legislation represents a fundamental and dramatic shift in U.S. taxation, with many provisions of the Act differing significantly from previous U.S. tax law. With enactment occurring late in 2017, companies with calendar reporting years have not had extensive time to analyze the impacts of the legislation. Applying the effects of a lower corporate tax rate to deferred tax assets and liabilities, evaluating the one-time transition tax on undistributed earnings of foreign operations, examining the implications of changes to net operating loss and other credit carryforwards and considering other provisions of the Act in a relatively compressed time frame necessitates significant estimation and judgment. Following the guidance of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, we have made reasonable estimates of the Act's provisions and have recorded a non-cash charge to fourth quarter tax expense of $186 to reflect these effects. This provisional estimate could be impacted based on further analysis of the Act's requirements. Given the Act's broad and complex changes, further clarification, interpretation and regulatory guidance could affect the assumptions we used in making our reasonable estimate. As we continue to assess the Act's provisions, any adjustments to our provisional estimate will be reported as a component of income tax expense in 2018 and disclosed in the period when any such adjustments have been determined.\nPrior to 2016, we carried a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the U.S. While our U.S. operations have experienced improved profitability in recent years, our analysis of the income of the U.S. operations, as adjusted for changes in historical results due to developments through 2015, demonstrated historical losses as of December 31, 2015. Additionally, there were considerable uncertainties in the U.S. in certain of our end markets. Therefore, we had not achieved a level of sustained profitability that would, in our judgment, support a release of the valuation allowance prior to 2016. With our improved level of profitability and forecast, we determined in the fourth quarter of 2016 that a valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets for federal tax purposes was no longer required, and we recognized a tax benefit of $501 for the release of valuation allowance. At December 31, 2016, we had retained a valuation allowance of $137 against deferred tax assets in the U.S. primarily related to state operating loss carryforwards and other credits which did not meet the more likely than not criterion for release of valuation allowance. Based on our 2017 financial performance and our financial outlook, we determined that a release of $27 in 2017 was appropriate.\nIn the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain. We are regularly under audit by the various applicable tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, we believe that we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns and that our annual tax provisions include amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year. See additional discussion of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nRetiree benefits - Accounting for pension benefits and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost to the time period each employee works. These plan expenses and obligations are dependent on assumptions developed by us in consultation with our outside advisers such as actuaries and other consultants and are generally calculated independently of funding requirements. The assumptions used, including inflation, discount rates, investment returns, life expectancies, turnover rates, retirement rates, future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates, have a significant impact on plan expenses and obligations. These assumptions are\nregularly reviewed and modified when appropriate based on historical experience, current trends and the future outlook. Changes in one or more of the underlying assumptions could result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements in any given period. If actual experience differs from expectations, our financial position and results of operations in future periods could be affected.\nMortality rates are based in part on the company's plan experience and actuarial estimates. The inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators, while retirement and turnover rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. Health care cost trend rates are developed based on our actual historical claims experience, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. For our largest plans, discount rates are based upon the construction of a yield curve which is developed based on a subset of high-quality fixed-income investments (those with yields between the 40th and 90th percentiles). The projected cash flows are matched to this yield curve and a present value developed which is then calibrated to develop a single equivalent discount rate. Pension benefits are funded through deposits with trustees that satisfy, at a minimum, the applicable funding regulations. For our largest defined benefit pension plans, expected investment rates of return are based on input from the plans' investment advisers and actuary regarding our expected investment portfolio mix, historical rates of return on those assets, projected future asset class returns, the impact of active management and long-term market conditions and inflation expectations. We believe that the long-term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation and we regularly review the actual asset allocation to periodically re-balance the investments to the targeted allocation when appropriate. OPEB and the majority of our non-U.S. pension benefits are funded as they become due.\nActuarial gains or losses may result from changes in assumptions or when actual experience is different from that which was expected. Under the applicable standards, those gains and losses are not required to be immediately recognized in our results of operations as income or expense, but instead are deferred as part of AOCI and amortized into our results of operations over future periods.\nU.S. retirement plans\nOur U.S. defined benefit pension plans comprise 82% of our consolidated defined benefit pension obligations at December 31, 2017. These plans are frozen and no service-related costs are being incurred. Changes in our net obligations are principally attributable to changing discount rates and the performance of plan assets. In part to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in unfunded pension obligations, our Board of Directors approved in October 2017 the termination of a U.S. defined benefit pension plan. At December 31, 2017, this plan had benefit obligations of $1,064 and assets of $900. The benefit obligations have been valued at the amount expected to be required to settle the obligations utilizing assumptions regarding the portion of obligations expected to be settled through participant acceptance of lump sum payments or annuities and the cost to purchase annuities. Increasing the plan's obligations to reflect the expected settlement value resulted in an actuarial loss of $69 that was charged to OCI in 2017. Ultimate plan termination is subject to regulatory approval and to prevailing market conditions and other considerations, including interest rates and annuity pricing. In the event that approvals are received and we proceed with effecting termination of the plan, settlement of the obligations is expected to occur in the first half of 2019. For our other pension plans, benefit obligations are valued using discount rates established annually in consultation with our outside actuarial advisers using the same yield curve approach described above. Rising discount rates decrease the present value of future pension obligations - a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease our U.S. pension liability by about $41. As indicated above, when establishing the expected long-term rate of return on our U.S. pension plan assets, we consider historical performance and forward looking return estimates reflective of our portfolio mix and investment strategy. Based on the most recent analysis of projected portfolio returns, we concluded that the use of a 6.0% expected return in 2018 is appropriate for our U.S. pension plans where termination is not anticipated. With the asset portfolio of the plan being terminated having a larger proportion of cash and fixed income investments, a rate of return of 4.1% through the expected settlement date in the first half of 2019 was considered appropriate. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for information about the investing and allocation objectives related to our U.S. pension plan assets.\nThe Society of Actuaries (SOA) issued new mortality improvement scales in the fourth quarter of 2017, marking the fourth consecutive year for revised guidance. In developing MP-2017, the SOA considered actual experience through 2014 and preliminary data for 2015. When it issued MP-2014, the SOA had projected improvement from the beginning of 2008 after analyzing historical data through 2007. In connection with selecting our assumptions in 2014, we had compared actual experience for years after 2007 to the improvement projected in MP-2014, along with other information, before concluding that a 0.75% long-term improvement rate (LTIR) for periods beginning with 2014 was appropriate and assuming that the LTIR would be attained by 2020, sooner than the period assumed in MP-2014. We reviewed the data in MP-2017 and concluded that the adjustments made in the past are also appropriate with respect to the latest guidance, resulting in the adoption of MP-2017 modified to reflect an LTIR of 0.75% being achieved by 2026. Adopting the modified MP-2017 scale did not have a material effect on our pension obligations.\nIn 2016, we began using a full yield curve approach to estimate the service (where applicable) and interest components of the annual cost of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The new method estimates interest and service expense using the specific spot rates, from the yield curve, that relate to projected cash flows. Prior to 2016, we had estimated interest and service expense using the discount rate underlying the calculation of the related projected benefit obligation at the end of the preceding year. That rate was a weighted-average rate derived from the corresponding yield curve. The full yield curve approach, which we believe is more precise, reduced interest expense for our pension plans in the U.S. by approximately $14 in 2016 and $11 in 2017. The determination of the projected benefit obligation at year end is unchanged, however, so the actuarial gain or loss is affected by the amount of the change in interest and service expense.\nAt December 31, 2017, we have $559 of unrecognized losses relating to our U.S. pension plans. Actuarial gains and losses, which are primarily the result of changes in the discount rate and other assumptions and differences between actual and expected asset returns, are deferred in AOCI and amortized to expense following the corridor approach. We use the average remaining service period of active participants unless almost all of the plan's participants are inactive, in which case we use the average remaining life expectancy of inactive participants. The plan being terminated has deferred actuarial losses of $369 at December 31, 2017. The unrecognized actuarial losses of this plan that remain when the obligations are settled in 2019 will be recognized as expense at that time.\nActuarial gains and losses can also impact required cash contributions. Based on the current funded status of our U.S. plans, there are no minimum contribution requirements for 2018. For the U.S. plan being terminated, to effectuate the expected settlement in 2019, Dana will be required to fund any plan obligations in excess of assets. Based on the plan obligation settlement assumptions and asset values at December 31, 2017, the unfunded plan obligations are $164. The actual cash requirement at settlement will vary from this amount based on the actual cost of annuities and participant settlement elections relative to those assumed for year-end 2017 valuation and the actual return on assets compared to the 4.1% expected annual rate of return.\nSee Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional discussion of our pension and OPEB obligations.\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets - Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually as of October 31 for all of our reporting units, and more frequently if events or circumstances warrant such a review. We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We also utilize market valuation models which require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to our assets and businesses. We use our internal forecasts, which we update quarterly, to make our cash flow projections. These forecasts are based on our knowledge of our customers' production forecasts, our assessment of market growth rates, net new business, material and labor cost estimates, cost recovery agreements with customers and our estimate of savings expected from our restructuring activities.\nThe most likely factors that would significantly impact our forecasts are changes in customer production levels and loss of significant portions of our business. We believe that the assumptions and estimates used in the assessment of the goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 31, 2017 were reasonable. Aside from the goodwill recorded in connection with the Magnum and SJT Forjaria Ltda. acquisitions, we believe there is a significant excess of fair value over the carrying value of the related assets at December 31, 2017.\nLong-lived assets with definite lives - We perform impairment assessments on our property, plant and equipment and our definite-lived intangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. When indications are present, we compare the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate to the carrying amounts of such assets. We utilize the cash flow projections discussed above for property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangibles. We group the assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the undiscounted future cash flows using the life of the primary assets. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not recoverable from future cash flows and exceed their fair value, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets to their fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows, third party appraisals or other methods that provide appropriate estimates of value. Determining whether a triggering event has occurred, performing the impairment analysis and estimating the fair value of the assets require numerous assumptions and a considerable amount of management judgment.\nInvestments in affiliates - We had aggregate investments in affiliates of $163 at December 31, 2017 and $150 at December 31, 2016. We monitor our investments in affiliates for indicators of other-than-temporary declines in value on an ongoing basis\nin accordance with GAAP. If we determine that an other-than temporary decline in value has occurred, we recognize an impairment loss, which is measured as the difference between the recorded carrying value and the fair value of the investment. Fair value is generally determined using the discounted cash flows (an income approach) or guideline public company (a market approach) methods. A deterioration in industry conditions and decline in the operating results of our non-consolidated affiliates could result in the impairment of our investments. During 2015, we recorded a $39 impairment charge related to our investment in DDAC. See Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information.\nWarranty - Costs related to product warranty obligations are estimated and accrued at the time of sale with a charge against cost of sales. Warranty accruals are evaluated and adjusted as appropriate based on occurrences giving rise to potential warranty exposure and associated experience. Warranty accruals and adjustments require significant judgment, including a determination of our involvement in the matter giving rise to the potential warranty issue or claim, our contractual requirements, estimates of units requiring repair and estimates of repair costs. If actual experience differs from expectations, our financial position and results of operations in future periods could be affected.\nContingency reserves - We have numerous other loss exposures, such as product liability and warranty claims and matters involving litigation. Establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment regarding risk of exposure and ultimate liability. Product liability and warranty claims are generally estimated based on historical experience and the estimated costs associated with specific events giving rise to potential field campaigns or recalls. In the case of legal contingencies, estimates are made of the likely outcome of legal proceedings and potential exposure where reasonably determinable based on the information presently known to us. New information and other developments in these matters could materially affect our recorded liabilities.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of the company, discussing its global presence and diversified customer base, as well as operational and strategic initiatives aimed at customer centricity, global market expansion, and product development for hybrid and electric vehicles.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Dollars in millions)\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8.\nManagement Overview\nWe are a global provider of high-technology products to virtually every major vehicle and engine manufacturer in the world. We also serve the stationary industrial market. Our technologies include drive and motion products (axles, driveshafts, planetary hub drives, power-transmission products, tire-management products and transmissions); sealing solutions (gaskets, seals, heat shields and fuel-cell plates); thermal-management technologies (transmission and engine oil cooling, battery and electronics cooling and exhaust-gas heat recovery); and fluid-power products (pumps, valves, motors and controls). We serve our global light vehicle, medium/heavy vehicle and off-highway markets through four business units - Light Vehicle Driveline Technologies (Light Vehicle), Commercial Vehicle Driveline Technologies (Commercial Vehicle), Off-Highway Drive and Motion Technologies (Off-Highway) and Power Technologies, which is the center of excellence for sealing and thermal-management technologies that span all customers in our on-highway and off-highway markets. We have a diverse customer base and geographic footprint which minimizes our exposure to individual market and segment declines. In 2017, 51% of our sales came from North American operations and 49% from operations throughout the rest of the world. Our sales by operating segment were Light Vehicle - 44%, Commercial Vehicle - 20%, Off-Highway - 21% and Power Technologies - 15%.\nOperational and Strategic Initiatives\nOur enterprise strategy builds on our strong technology foundation and leverages our resources across the organization while maintaining a customer centric focus, expanding our global markets, and accelerating the commercialization of new technology as we evolve into the era of vehicle electrification.\nCentral to our strategy is leveraging our core operations by sharing our capabilities, technology, assets and knowledge across the enterprise, leading to improved execution and increased customer satisfaction. Through streamlining and rationalizing our manufacturing activities we have significantly improved our profitability and margins, and we believe additional opportunities remain to further optimize our manufacturing footprint and improve our cost performance. Leveraging investments across multiple end markets and making disciplined, value enhancing acquisitions will allow us to bring product to market faster, grow our top-line sales and enhance financial returns.\nStrengthening customer centricity and expanding global markets are key elements of our strategy that focus on market penetration. Foundational to growing the business is directing the entire organization to putting the customer at the center of our value system and shifting from transactional to relationship-based interactions. These relationships are built on a foundation of providing unparalleled technology with exceptional quality, delivery and value. With even stronger relationships we will be better positioned to support our customers' most important global and flagship programs and capitalize on future growth opportunities.\nWe continue to enhance and expand our global footprint, optimizing it to capture growth across all of our end markets. Specifically, our manufacturing and technology center footprint positions us to support customers globally - an important factor as many of our customers are increasingly focused on common solutions for global platforms. Our acquisition of the Brevini operations in 2017 (see Acquisitions section below) provided us with operational presence in eight additional countries, while also providing us with additional opportunities to leverage our global footprint to support the needs across all our businesses. Shortly following the acquisition, we were able to consolidate certain Brevini activities in China, allowing us to utilize an acquired facility to support our Power Technologies business in China.\nWhile growth opportunities are present in each region of the world, we have a primary focus on building our presence and local capability in the Asia Pacific region. Over the last few years, we have opened two new engineering facilities in the region, gear manufacturing facilities in India and Thailand, and are currently developing a new light vehicle assembly facility in China that is scheduled to commence operations in 2018.\nIn addition to Asia, we see further growth opportunity in Eastern Europe. A new gear manufacturing facility in Hungary is under construction and scheduled to commence operations in the first half of 2018. This will be our third facility in the country and will give us the capability to cost effectively manufacture gears, one of our core technologies, and efficiently service our customers within the region.\nThe final two elements of our enterprise strategy, commercializing new technology and accelerating hybridization and electrification, focus on opportunities for product expansion. Bringing new innovations to market as industry leading products will drive growth as our new products and technology provide our customers with cutting-edge solutions, address end user needs and capitalize on key market trends. An example is our industry leading electronically disconnecting all-wheel drive technology, which we believe is the most fuel efficient rapidly disconnecting system in the market, will be utilized on a Ford Motor Company global vehicle platform - opening up new commercial channels for us in the passenger car, crossover and sport utility vehicle markets. The above-referenced new assembly facility under construction in China will support this new program.\nInitiatives to capitalize on evolving hybridization and electrification vehicle trends are a core ingredient of our current strategy. In addition to our current technologies in battery cooling and fuel cells, this element of our strategy is leveraging our electronics controls expertise across all our business units and applications such as advanced vehicle hybridization and electrification initiatives. We are working with customers to develop new solutions for those markets where electrification will be adopted first such as hybrids, buses and urban delivery vehicles. These new solutions, which include advanced electric propulsion systems with fully integrated motors and controls, are included in our recently launched Spicer Electrified portfolio of products. Working with our joint venture partner, our latest integrated e-axle is scheduled to launch in the first quarter of 2018 in a bus application in China.\nThe development and implementation of our enterprise strategy is positioning Dana to grow profitably due to increased customer focus as we leverage our core capabilities, expand into new markets, develop and commercialize new technologies including for hybrid and electric vehicles.\nCapital Structure Initiatives\nIn addition to investing in our business, we plan to continue prioritizing the allocation of capital to reduce debt and maintain a strong financial position. In January 2018, we announced our intention to drive toward investment grade metrics as part of a balanced approach to our capital allocation priorities and our goal of further strengthening our balance sheet.\nShareholder return actions - When evaluating capital structure initiatives, we balance our growth opportunities and shareholder value initiatives with maintaining a strong balance sheet and access to capital. Our strong financial position has enabled us to simplify our capital structure while providing returns to our shareholders in the form of cash dividends and a reduction in the number of shares outstanding. Over the past five years, we returned $1,481 of cash to shareholders by redeeming all of our preferred stock and repurchasing common shares. From program inception in 2012 through December 31, 2017, we repurchased approximately 74 million shares, inclusive of the common share equivalent reduction resulting from redemption of preferred shares. With the availability under the previous authorization having expired, our Board of Directors authorized a new $100 share repurchase program which was effective January 2018 and expires at the end of 2019. We declared and paid quarterly common stock dividends over the past five years, raising the dividend from five cents to six cents per share in the second quarter of 2015. In recognition of our strong financial performance and confidence in our financial outlook, our Board approved an additional four cents per share increase in the quarterly dividend to ten cents per share in 2018.\nFinancing actions - We have taken advantage of the lower interest rate environment to complete refinancing transactions in each of the past four years that resulted in lower effective interest rates while extending maturities. In 2017, we completed a $400 2025 note offering and entered into a $275 floating rate term loan. The proceeds of these issuances were used to repay higher cost international debt and to repay $450 of 2021 notes. In connection with amending our credit agreement to effectuate the term loan, we also increased our revolving credit facility by $100, providing us with $600 of back-up liquidity through 2022. Additionally, in 2017 we commenced the process of terminating one of our U.S. pension plans. This action allows us to effectively eliminate pension obligations and the associated future funding risk associated with interest rate and other market developments. We expect the termination action to be completed in 2019.\nOther Initiatives\nAftermarket opportunities - We have a global group dedicated to identifying and developing aftermarket growth opportunities that leverage the capabilities within our existing businesses - targeting increased future aftermarket sales. In January 2016, we completed the acquisition of Magnum\u00ae Gaskets' (Magnum) aftermarket distribution business, providing us access to new customers for sealing products and an additional aftermarket channel for other products. Powered by recognized brands such as Dana\u00ae, Spicer\u00ae, Victor Reinz\u00ae, Glaser\u00ae, GWB\u00ae, Thompson\u00ae, Tru-Cool\u00ae, SVL\u00ae, and Transejes\u2122, Dana delivers a broad range of aftermarket solutions - including genuine, all makes, and value lines - servicing passenger, commercial and off-highway vehicles across the globe.\nSelective acquisitions - Our acquisition focus is principally directed at bolt-on\u201d or adjacent acquisition opportunities that have a strategic fit with our existing core businesses, particularly opportunities that support our enterprise strategy and enhance the value proposition of our product offerings. Any potential acquisition will be evaluated in the same manner we currently consider customer program opportunities and other uses of capital - with a disciplined financial approach designed to ensure profitable growth and increased shareholder value.\nAcquisitions\nUSM - Warren - On March 1, 2017, we completed the purchase of Warren Manufacturing LLC (USM - Warren), which holds certain assets and liabilities of the former Warren, Michigan production unit of U.S. Manufacturing Corporation (USM). With this transaction, we acquired proprietary tube-manufacturing processes and light-weighting intellectual property for axle tubes and shafts. Significant content was previously purchased from USM. Vertically integrating this content strengthens the supply chain for several of our most strategic customers. The new product and process technologies for light-weighting will assist our customers in achieving their sustainability and fuel efficiency goals. The USM - Warren acquisition added $96 of sales and $12 of adjusted EBITDA in 2017. The results of operations of the USM - Warren business are reported within our Light Vehicle operating segment.\nWe paid $104 for this business at closing, including $25 to effectively settle trade payable obligations originating from product purchases Dana made from USM prior to the acquisition. No debt was assumed with this transaction which was funded using cash on hand. Post-closing purchase price adjustments for working capital and other items, which totaled less than $1, were received in this year's third quarter. Reference is made to Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for the allocation of purchase consideration to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nBFP and BPT - On February 1, 2017, we acquired 80% ownership interests in Brevini Fluid Power S.p.A. (BFP) and Brevini Power Transmission S.p.A. (BPT) from Brevini Group S.p.A. (Brevini). The acquisition expands our Off-Highway operating segment product portfolio to include technologies for tracked vehicles, doubling our addressable market for off-highway driveline systems and establishing Dana as the only off-highway solutions provider that can manage the power to both move the equipment and perform its critical work functions. This acquisition also brings a platform of technologies that can be leveraged in our light and commercial vehicle end markets, helping to accelerate our hybridization and electrification initiatives. The BFP and BPT acquisitions added $401 of sales and $40 of adjusted EBITDA in 2017. The results of operations of these businesses are reported within our Off-Highway operating segment.\nWe paid $181 at closing using cash on hand and assumed debt of $181 as part of the transaction. In December 2017, a purchase price reduction of $9 was agreed under the sale and purchase agreement provisions for determination of the net indebtedness and net working capital levels of BFP and BPT as of the closing date. In connection with the acquisition of BFP and BPT, Dana agreed to purchase certain real estate currently being leased by BPT from a Brevini affiliate for \u20ac25 by November 1, 2017. Purchase at this date did not occur due to document transfer requirements not having been fully satisfied. Receipt of the purchase price adjustment will occur concurrent with the completion of the real estate purchase during the first quarter of 2018. Reference is made to Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for the allocation of purchase consideration to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The terms of the agreement provide Dana the right to call Brevini's noncontrolling interests in BFP and BPT, and Brevini the right to put its noncontrolling interests in BFP and BPT to Dana, assuming Dana does not exercise its call rights, at dates and prices defined in the agreement.\nSIFCO - On December 23, 2016, we acquired strategic assets of the commercial vehicle steer axle systems and related forged components businesses of SIFCO. The acquisition enables us to enhance our vertically integrated supply chain, which will further improve our cost structure and customer satisfaction by leveraging SIFCO's extensive experience and knowledge of sophisticated forged components. In addition to strengthening our position as a central source for products that use forged and machined parts throughout the region, this acquisition enables us to better accommodate the local content requirements of our customers, which reduces their import and other region-specific costs.\nAs part of the acquisition, we added two manufacturing facilities and approximately 1,400 employees. The strategic assets were acquired by Dana free and clear of any liens, claims or encumbrances and without assumption of any legacy liabilities of SIFCO. We had sales of $86 in 2016 resulting from business conducted under the previous supply agreement with SIFCO. The additional business relationships obtained as a result of the acquisition generated incremental sales of $44 in 2017. The results of operations of the SIFCO related business are reported within our Commercial Vehicle operating segment.\nThe SIFCO purchase price was $70, with the payment of $10 of the purchase price deferred until December 2017 pending any claims under indemnification provisions of the purchase agreement. In December 2017, the parties to the SIFCO transaction entered into a settlement agreement. Under this agreement, $3 was paid to the seller with the remaining deferred\npurchase price of $7 being retained by Dana to settle indemnification claims. After the settlement of all indemnification claims, any remaining deferred purchase price will be paid to the seller. Reference is made to Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for the allocation of purchase consideration to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nMagnum - On January 29, 2016, we acquired the aftermarket distribution business of Magnum, a U.S.-based supplier of gaskets and sealing products for automotive and commercial vehicle applications, for a cash payment of $18. Assets acquired included trademarks and trade names, customer relationships and goodwill. The results of operations of Magnum are reported within our Power Technologies operating segment.\nDivestitures\nBrazil Suspension Components Operations - In December 2017, we entered into an agreement to divest our Brazil suspension components business (the disposal group). This business is non-core to our enterprise strategy and under-performing financially. As such, we agreed to divest the business for no consideration and contribute $10 of additional cash to the business prior to closing. Completion of the sale is expected in the first quarter of 2018 upon receipt of Brazilian antitrust approval. The disposal group was classified as held for sale at December 31, 2017. We recognized a pre-tax loss of $27 in the fourth quarter of 2017 to adjust the carrying value of the net assets to fair value and to recognize the liability for the additional cash required to be contributed to the business prior to closing. Reference is made to Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information, including the carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities of the disposal group held for sale at December 31, 2017. Sales of the business being divested approximated $23 in 2017. In connection with the divestiture of this business, we entered into a supply agreement whereby Dana will purchase specified components to satisfy customer requirements from the purchaser of the divested business at market prices.\nNippon Reinz - On November 30, 2016, we sold our 53.7% interest in Nippon Reinz Co. Ltd. (Nippon Reinz) to Nichias Corporation. Dana received net cash proceeds of $5 and recognized a pre-tax loss of $3 on the divestiture of Nippon Reinz, inclusive of the derecognition of the related noncontrolling interest. Nippon Reinz had sales of $42 in 2016 through the transaction date.\nDana Companies - On December 30, 2016, we completed the divestiture of Dana Companies, LLC (DCLLC), a consolidated wholly-owned limited liability company that was established as part of our reorganization in 2008 to hold and manage personal injury asbestos claims retained by the reorganized Dana Corporation, which was merged into DCLLC. The assets of DCLLC at time of sale included cash and marketable securities along with the rights to insurance coverage in place to satisfy a significant portion of its liabilities. We received net cash proceeds of $29 at closing on December 30, 2016, with $3 retained by the purchaser subject to the satisfaction of certain future conditions. We recognized a pre-tax loss of $77 in 2016 upon completion of the transaction. We received payment of the retained $3 in the second quarter of 2017 and recognized such amount as income. Following completion of the sale, Dana has no obligation with respect to current or future asbestos claims. The sale of this business also enhanced our available liquidity since the net proceeds from the sale are available for use in our core businesses.\nVenezuela Operations - In December 2014, we entered into an agreement to divest our operations in Venezuela (the disposal group) to an unaffiliated company for no consideration. We completed the divestiture in January 2015. In connection with the divestiture, we entered into a supply and technology agreement whereby Dana will supply product and technology to the operations at competitive market prices. Dana has no obligations to otherwise provide support to the operations. The disposal group was classified as held for sale at December 31, 2014, and we recognized a net charge of $77 - an $80 loss to adjust the carrying value of the net assets to fair value less cost to sell, with a reduction of $3 for the noncontrolling interest share of the loss. These assets and liabilities were presented as held for sale on our December 31, 2014 balance sheet. Upon completion of the divestiture of the disposal group in January 2015, we recognized a gain of $5 on the derecognition of the noncontrolling interest in a former Venezuelan subsidiary in other income (expense), net. We also credited other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) attributable to the parent for $10 and OCI attributable to noncontrolling interests for $1 to eliminate the unrecognized pension expense recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information. With the completion of the sale in January 2015, Dana has no remaining investment in Venezuela.\nStructural Products Business - In 2010, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our Structural Products business to Metalsa S.A. de C.V. (Metalsa) and reached a final agreement with the buyer on disputed issues in May 2014. Prior to the third quarter of 2012, Structural Products was reported as an operating segment of continuing operations. With the cessation of the retained operations in the third quarter of 2012, we began reporting the activities relating to the Structural Products business as discontinued operations. Legal and other costs incurred in 2014 to settle a customer complaint and the\nremaining disputes with Metalsa and insurance recoveries in 2015 related to previously outstanding claims have extended the reporting of discontinued operations.\nSegments\nWe manage our operations globally through four operating segments. Our Light Vehicle and Power Technologies segments primarily support light vehicle original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) with products for light trucks, SUVs, CUVs, vans and passenger cars. The Commercial Vehicle segment supports the OEMs of on-highway commercial vehicles (primarily trucks and buses), while our Off-Highway segment supports OEMs of off-highway vehicles (primarily wheeled vehicles used in construction, mining and agricultural applications).\nTrends in Our Markets\nGlobal Vehicle Production\n\nNorth America\nLight vehicle markets - Improving economic conditions during the past few years have contributed to increased light vehicle sales and production levels in North America. Overall economic conditions in North America continue to be relatively favorable with improving employment levels and upward trending consumer confidence. After increasing by about 1% in 2016 from 2015, the North America light vehicle market begun to show signs of weakening demand levels this past year as strong sales levels the past few years have significantly reduced the built-up demand to replace older vehicles. As such, 2017 light vehicle sales declined about 2% from 2016. Within the light vehicle segment, passenger car sales declined around 5% in 2016, and another 9% in 2017. In part due to comparatively low fuel prices when compared with recent years, demand for light trucks and SUVs continued to be strong, increasing about 7% in 2016 and 4% in 2017. Many of our customer programs are focused in the full frame light truck segment. Sales in this segment increased 6% in 2016 and another 3% in 2017. Production levels were generally reflective of light vehicle sales. Production of 17.8 million light vehicles in 2016 was 2% higher than 2015, with 2017 light vehicle production coming in at approximately 17.1 million units - down 4% from 2016. Light vehicle engine production was impacted more by the developments in the passenger car segment, with production in 2017 declining about 7% versus\n2016 after increasing 3% year-over-year in 2016. In the key full frame light truck segment, production levels in 2017 increased about 3% compared to 2016 following an increase of 7% in 2016 from the preceding year. Days' supply of total light vehicles in the U.S. at the end of December the past three years has been around 61 to 62 days. In the full frame light truck segment, days supply in inventory at December 31, 2017 approximated 64 days, down slightly from 65 days at December 31, 2016 and up from 62 days at the end of December 2015.\nLight truck markets are expected to remain relatively strong given the positive North America economic environment that is expected to drive continued growth in manufacturing and construction activities in 2018. Rising interest rates, less pent-up demand, higher levels of consumer debt and declining used car prices may constrict demand. We expect Dana sales will continue to benefit from strong market demand for key vehicles that we supply which launched within the past two years. Our current outlook for 2018 has full frame light truck production at 4.0 to 4.3 million vehicles, comparable to down 8% with 2017 production of about 4.3 million vehicles. We expect light vehicle engine production in 2018 to be 14.8 to 15.1 million units, comparable to up slightly compared to this past year.\nMedium/heavy vehicle markets - The commercial vehicle market is similarly impacted by many of the same macroeconomic developments impacting the light vehicle market. Strong production levels in the heavy truck segment in 2014 and first half of 2015 led to more trucks than required to meet freight demand. As a consequence, production levels in 2016 were scaled back. Class 8 heavy truck production in 2016 declined 29% from 2015, while Classes 5-7 medium truck build was relatively comparable. The North American economy gaining strength in 2017 has led to increased freight-hauling demand and a strengthening order book for new Class 8 trucks. During 2017, heavy duty Class 8 truck production was up approximately 12% while medium duty Classes 5-7 truck production was up 6% compared with 2016.\nClass 8 order levels increased significantly during the second half of 2017, positioning 2018 to be a strong production year. With the strong Class 8 order book and an expectation that the North America economic environment will continue to be strong in 2018, our outlook for 2018 Class 8 production in North America is 290,000 to 310,000 trucks, a level which is up about 14 to 22% compared with the 2017 build level. In the medium duty segment, we expect full year 2018 production to be in the range of 245,000 to 255,000 vehicles, comparable to up 4% from 2017.\nMarkets Outside of North America\nLight vehicle markets - Signs of an improved overall European economy have been evident, albeit mixed at times, during the past few years. While improving modestly in 2015 and 2016, signs of a strengthening economic climate were evident in 2017. Reflective of an improved economic environment, light vehicle engine production was up about 3% in both 2016 and 2017 and light truck production was higher by 9 to 10% in each of the past two years. The United Kingdom's decision to withdraw from the European Union, along with political developments in other European countries, continues to cast an element of uncertainty around continued economic improvement in the region. At present, we expect overall stable to improving economic conditions across the entire region in 2018. Our full year 2018 outlook expects an increase in light truck and light vehicle engine production of around 3 to 6% from 2017. The economic climate in many South American markets the past few years has been weak, volatile and challenging. After significant production declines in 2014 and 2015, there were signs that demand levels had bottomed out in 2016. Production levels in 2017 were reflective of an improving market, with light vehicle engine production up 14% and light truck production up 26% compared to 2016. At present, we expect further economic recovery in the region in 2018. Our full year 2018 outlook has light truck production increasing 5 to 21% from 2017, with light vehicle engine production up 10 to 14% compared to this past year. The Asia Pacific markets have been relatively strong the past few years. Light truck production increased 8% in 2015 and was up another 14% in 2016, while light vehicle engine production increased 2% in 2015 and another 7% in 2016. Further production increases occurred this past year, with 2017 light truck production up 7% and light vehicle engine build up 4%. Our full year 2018 outlook for the Asia Pacific light vehicle markets is for continued strong production levels, with the light truck segment up 1 to 5% from 2017 and light engine production being comparable to up 2%.\nMedium/heavy vehicle markets - Some of the same factors referenced above that affected light vehicle markets outside of North America similarly affected the medium/heavy markets. A strengthening European market the past three years contributed to medium/heavy truck production increasing 9% in 2015, 7% in 2016 and another 5% in 2017. Our 2018 full year outlook anticipates continued strong production at levels relatively comparable with 2017. A weakening South America economic climate beginning in 2014 led to medium/heavy truck production declining 47% in 2015 and another 20% in 2016. As with the light vehicle markets, improving economic conditions in the region led to medium/heavy truck production in 2017 being up about 28% from the preceding year. We expect that", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Dollars in millions)\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8.\nManagement Overview\nWe are a global provider of high-technology products to virtually every major vehicle and engine manufacturer in the world. We also serve the stationary industrial market. Our technologies include drive and motion products (axles, driveshafts, planetary hub drives, power-transmission products, tire-management products and transmissions); sealing solutions (gaskets, seals, heat shields and fuel-cell plates); thermal-management technologies (transmission and engine oil cooling, battery and electronics cooling and exhaust-gas heat recovery); and fluid-power products (pumps, valves, motors and controls). We serve our global light vehicle, medium/heavy vehicle and off-highway markets through four business units - Light Vehicle Driveline Technologies (Light Vehicle), Commercial Vehicle Driveline Technologies (Commercial Vehicle), Off-Highway Drive and Motion Technologies (Off-Highway) and Power Technologies, which is the center of excellence for sealing and thermal-management technologies that span all customers in our on-highway and off-highway markets. We have a diverse customer base and geographic footprint which minimizes our exposure to individual market and segment declines. In 2017, 51% of our sales came from North American operations and 49% from operations throughout the rest of the world. Our sales by operating segment were Light Vehicle - 44%, Commercial Vehicle - 20%, Off-Highway - 21% and Power Technologies - 15%.\nOperational and Strategic Initiatives\nOur enterprise strategy builds on our strong technology foundation and leverages our resources across the organization while maintaining a customer centric focus, expanding our global markets, and accelerating the commercialization of new technology as we evolve into the era of vehicle electrification.\nCentral to our strategy is leveraging our core operations by sharing our capabilities, technology, assets and knowledge across the enterprise, leading to improved execution and increased customer satisfaction. Through streamlining and rationalizing our manufacturing activities we have significantly improved our profitability and margins, and we believe additional opportunities remain to further optimize our manufacturing footprint and improve our cost performance. Leveraging investments across multiple end markets and making disciplined, value enhancing acquisitions will allow us to bring product to market faster, grow our top-line sales and enhance financial returns.\nStrengthening customer centricity and expanding global markets are key elements of our strategy that focus on market penetration. Foundational to growing the business is directing the entire organization to putting the customer at the center of our value system and shifting from transactional to relationship-based interactions. These relationships are built on a foundation of providing unparalleled technology with exceptional quality, delivery and value. With even stronger relationships we will be better positioned to support our customers' most important global and flagship programs and capitalize on future growth opportunities.\nWe continue to enhance and expand our global footprint, optimizing it to capture growth across all of our end markets. Specifically, our manufacturing and technology center footprint positions us to support customers globally - an important factor as many of our customers are increasingly focused on common solutions for global platforms. Our acquisition of the Brevini operations in 2017 (see Acquisitions section below) provided us with operational presence in eight additional countries, while also providing us with additional opportunities to leverage our global footprint to support the needs across all our businesses. Shortly following the acquisition, we were able to consolidate certain Brevini activities in China, allowing us to utilize an acquired facility to support our Power Technologies business in China.\nWhile growth opportunities are present in each region of the world, we have a primary focus on building our presence and local capability in the Asia Pacific region. Over the last few years, we have opened two new engineering facilities in the region, gear manufacturing facilities in India and Thailand, and are currently developing a new light vehicle assembly facility in China that is scheduled to commence operations in 2018.\nIn addition to Asia, we see further growth opportunity in Eastern Europe. A new gear manufacturing facility in Hungary is under construction and scheduled to commence operations in the first half of 2018. This will be our third facility in the country and will give us the capability to cost effectively manufacture gears, one of our core technologies, and efficiently service our customers within the region.\nThe final two elements of our enterprise strategy, commercializing new technology and accelerating hybridization and electrification, focus on opportunities for product expansion. Bringing new innovations to market as industry leading products will drive growth as our new products and technology provide our customers with cutting-edge solutions, address end user needs and capitalize on key market trends. An example is our industry leading electronically disconnecting all-wheel drive technology, which we believe is the most fuel efficient rapidly disconnecting system in the market, will be utilized on a Ford Motor Company global vehicle platform - opening up new commercial channels for us in the passenger car, crossover and sport utility vehicle markets. The above-referenced new assembly facility under construction in China will support this new program.\nInitiatives to capitalize on evolving hybridization and electrification vehicle trends are a core ingredient of our current strategy. In addition to our current technologies in battery cooling and fuel cells, this element of our strategy is leveraging our electronics controls expertise across all our business units and applications such as advanced vehicle hybridization and electrification initiatives. We are working with customers to develop new solutions for those markets where electrification will be adopted first such as hybrids, buses and urban delivery vehicles. These new solutions, which include advanced electric propulsion systems with fully integrated motors and controls, are included in our recently launched Spicer Electrified portfolio of products. Working with our joint venture partner, our latest integrated e-axle is scheduled to launch in the first quarter of 2018 in a bus application in China.\nThe development and implementation of our enterprise strategy is positioning Dana to grow profitably due to increased customer focus as we leverage our core capabilities, expand into new markets, develop and commercialize new technologies including for hybrid and electric vehicles.\nCapital Structure Initiatives\nIn addition to investing in our business, we plan to continue prioritizing the allocation of capital to reduce debt and maintain a strong financial position. In January 2018, we announced our intention to drive toward investment grade metrics as part of a balanced approach to our capital allocation priorities and our goal of further strengthening our balance sheet.\nShareholder return actions - When evaluating capital structure initiatives, we balance our growth opportunities and shareholder value initiatives with maintaining a strong balance sheet and access to capital. Our strong financial position has enabled us to simplify our capital structure while providing returns to our shareholders in the form of cash dividends and a reduction in the number of shares outstanding. Over the past five years, we returned $1,481 of cash to shareholders by redeeming all of our preferred stock and repurchasing common shares. From program inception in 2012 through December 31, 2017, we repurchased approximately 74 million shares, inclusive of the common share equivalent reduction resulting from redemption of preferred shares. With the availability under the previous authorization having expired, our Board of Directors authorized a new $100 share repurchase program which was effective January 2018 and expires at the end of 2019. We declared and paid quarterly common stock dividends over the past five years, raising the dividend from five cents to six cents per share in the second quarter of 2015. In recognition of our strong financial performance and confidence in our financial outlook, our Board approved an additional four cents per share increase in the quarterly dividend to ten cents per share in 2018.\nFinancing actions - We have taken advantage of the lower interest rate environment to complete refinancing transactions in each of the past four years that resulted in lower effective interest rates while extending maturities. In 2017, we completed a $400 2025 note offering and entered into a $275 floating rate term loan. The proceeds of these issuances were used to repay higher cost international debt and to repay $450 of 2021 notes. In connection with amending our credit agreement to effectuate the term loan, we also increased our revolving credit facility by $100, providing us with $600 of back-up liquidity through 2022. Additionally, in 2017 we commenced the process of terminating one of our U.S. pension plans. This action allows us to effectively eliminate pension obligations and the associated future funding risk associated with interest rate and other market developments. We expect the termination action to be completed in 2019.\nOther Initiatives\nAftermarket opportunities - We have a global group dedicated to identifying and developing aftermarket growth opportunities that leverage the capabilities within our existing businesses - targeting increased future aftermarket sales. In January 2016, we completed the acquisition of Magnum\u00ae Gaskets' (Magnum) aftermarket distribution business, providing us access to new customers for sealing products and an additional aftermarket channel for other products. Powered by recognized brands such as Dana\u00ae, Spicer\u00ae, Victor Reinz\u00ae, Glaser\u00ae, GWB\u00ae, Thompson\u00ae, Tru-Cool\u00ae, SVL\u00ae, and Transejes\u2122, Dana delivers a broad range of aftermarket solutions - including genuine, all makes, and value lines - servicing passenger, commercial and off-highway vehicles across the globe.\nSelective acquisitions - Our acquisition focus is principally directed at bolt-on\u201d or adjacent acquisition opportunities that have a strategic fit with our existing core businesses, particularly opportunities that support our enterprise strategy and enhance the value proposition of our product offerings. Any potential acquisition will be evaluated in the same manner we currently consider customer program opportunities and other uses of capital - with a disciplined financial approach designed to ensure profitable growth and increased shareholder value.\nAcquisitions\nUSM - Warren - On March 1, 2017, we completed the purchase of Warren Manufacturing LLC (USM - Warren), which holds certain assets and liabilities of the former Warren, Michigan production unit of U.S. Manufacturing Corporation (USM). With this transaction, we acquired proprietary tube-manufacturing processes and light-weighting intellectual property for axle tubes and shafts. Significant content was previously purchased from USM. Vertically integrating this content strengthens the supply chain for several of our most strategic customers. The new product and process technologies for light-weighting will assist our customers in achieving their sustainability and fuel efficiency goals. The USM - Warren acquisition added $96 of sales and $12 of adjusted EBITDA in 2017. The results of operations of the USM - Warren business are reported within our Light Vehicle operating segment.\nWe paid $104 for this business at closing, including $25 to effectively settle trade payable obligations originating from product purchases Dana made from USM prior to the acquisition. No debt was assumed with this transaction which was funded using cash on hand. Post-closing purchase price adjustments for working capital and other items, which totaled less than $1, were received in this year's third quarter. Reference is made to Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for the allocation of purchase consideration to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nBFP and BPT - On February 1, 2017, we acquired 80% ownership interests in Brevini Fluid Power S.p.A. (BFP) and Brevini Power Transmission S.p.A. (BPT) from Brevini Group S.p.A. (Brevini). The acquisition expands our Off-Highway operating segment product portfolio to include technologies for tracked vehicles, doubling our addressable market for off-highway driveline systems and establishing Dana as the only off-highway solutions provider that can manage the power to both move the equipment and perform its critical work functions. This acquisition also brings a platform of technologies that can be leveraged in our light and commercial vehicle end markets, helping to accelerate our hybridization and electrification initiatives. The BFP and BPT acquisitions added $401 of sales and $40 of adjusted EBITDA in 2017. The results of operations of these businesses are reported within our Off-Highway operating segment.\nWe paid $181 at closing using cash on hand and assumed debt of $181 as part of the transaction. In December 2017, a purchase price reduction of $9 was agreed under the sale and purchase agreement provisions for determination of the net indebtedness and net working capital levels of BFP and BPT as of the closing date. In connection with the acquisition of BFP and BPT, Dana agreed to purchase certain real estate currently being leased by BPT from a Brevini affiliate for \u20ac25 by November 1, 2017. Purchase at this date did not occur due to document transfer requirements not having been fully satisfied. Receipt of the purchase price adjustment will occur concurrent with the completion of the real estate purchase during the first quarter of 2018. Reference is made to Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for the allocation of purchase consideration to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The terms of the agreement provide Dana the right to call Brevini's noncontrolling interests in BFP and BPT, and Brevini the right to put its noncontrolling interests in BFP and BPT to Dana, assuming Dana does not exercise its call rights, at dates and prices defined in the agreement.\nSIFCO - On December 23, 2016, we acquired strategic assets of the commercial vehicle steer axle systems and related forged components businesses of SIFCO. The acquisition enables us to enhance our vertically integrated supply chain, which will further improve our cost structure and customer satisfaction by leveraging SIFCO's extensive experience and knowledge of sophisticated forged components. In addition to strengthening our position as a central source for products that use forged and machined parts throughout the region, this acquisition enables us to better accommodate the local content requirements of our customers, which reduces their import and other region-specific costs.\nAs part of the acquisition, we added two manufacturing facilities and approximately 1,400 employees. The strategic assets were acquired by Dana free and clear of any liens, claims or encumbrances and without assumption of any legacy liabilities of SIFCO. We had sales of $86 in 2016 resulting from business conducted under the previous supply agreement with SIFCO. The additional business relationships obtained as a result of the acquisition generated incremental sales of $44 in 2017. The results of operations of the SIFCO related business are reported within our Commercial Vehicle operating segment.\nThe SIFCO purchase price was $70, with the payment of $10 of the purchase price deferred until December 2017 pending any claims under indemnification provisions of the purchase agreement. In December 2017, the parties to the SIFCO transaction entered into a settlement agreement. Under this agreement, $3 was paid to the seller with the remaining deferred\npurchase price of $7 being retained by Dana to settle indemnification claims. After the settlement of all indemnification claims, any remaining deferred purchase price will be paid to the seller. Reference is made to Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for the allocation of purchase consideration to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nMagnum - On January 29, 2016, we acquired the aftermarket distribution business of Magnum, a U.S.-based supplier of gaskets and sealing products for automotive and commercial vehicle applications, for a cash payment of $18. Assets acquired included trademarks and trade names, customer relationships and goodwill. The results of operations of Magnum are reported within our Power Technologies operating segment.\nDivestitures\nBrazil Suspension Components Operations - In December 2017, we entered into an agreement to divest our Brazil suspension components business (the disposal group). This business is non-core to our enterprise strategy and under-performing financially. As such, we agreed to divest the business for no consideration and contribute $10 of additional cash to the business prior to closing. Completion of the sale is expected in the first quarter of 2018 upon receipt of Brazilian antitrust approval. The disposal group was classified as held for sale at December 31, 2017. We recognized a pre-tax loss of $27 in the fourth quarter of 2017 to adjust the carrying value of the net assets to fair value and to recognize the liability for the additional cash required to be contributed to the business prior to closing. Reference is made to Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information, including the carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities of the disposal group held for sale at December 31, 2017. Sales of the business being divested approximated $23 in 2017. In connection with the divestiture of this business, we entered into a supply agreement whereby Dana will purchase specified components to satisfy customer requirements from the purchaser of the divested business at market prices.\nNippon Reinz - On November 30, 2016, we sold our 53.7% interest in Nippon Reinz Co. Ltd. (Nippon Reinz) to Nichias Corporation. Dana received net cash proceeds of $5 and recognized a pre-tax loss of $3 on the divestiture of Nippon Reinz, inclusive of the derecognition of the related noncontrolling interest. Nippon Reinz had sales of $42 in 2016 through the transaction date.\nDana Companies - On December 30, 2016, we completed the divestiture of Dana Companies, LLC (DCLLC), a consolidated wholly-owned limited liability company that was established as part of our reorganization in 2008 to hold and manage personal injury asbestos claims retained by the reorganized Dana Corporation, which was merged into DCLLC. The assets of DCLLC at time of sale included cash and marketable securities along with the rights to insurance coverage in place to satisfy a significant portion of its liabilities. We received net cash proceeds of $29 at closing on December 30, 2016, with $3 retained by the purchaser subject to the satisfaction of certain future conditions. We recognized a pre-tax loss of $77 in 2016 upon completion of the transaction. We received payment of the retained $3 in the second quarter of 2017 and recognized such amount as income. Following completion of the sale, Dana has no obligation with respect to current or future asbestos claims. The sale of this business also enhanced our available liquidity since the net proceeds from the sale are available for use in our core businesses.\nVenezuela Operations - In December 2014, we entered into an agreement to divest our operations in Venezuela (the disposal group) to an unaffiliated company for no consideration. We completed the divestiture in January 2015. In connection with the divestiture, we entered into a supply and technology agreement whereby Dana will supply product and technology to the operations at competitive market prices. Dana has no obligations to otherwise provide support to the operations. The disposal group was classified as held for sale at December 31, 2014, and we recognized a net charge of $77 - an $80 loss to adjust the carrying value of the net assets to fair value less cost to sell, with a reduction of $3 for the noncontrolling interest share of the loss. These assets and liabilities were presented as held for sale on our December 31, 2014 balance sheet. Upon completion of the divestiture of the disposal group in January 2015, we recognized a gain of $5 on the derecognition of the noncontrolling interest in a former Venezuelan subsidiary in other income (expense), net. We also credited other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) attributable to the parent for $10 and OCI attributable to noncontrolling interests for $1 to eliminate the unrecognized pension expense recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information. With the completion of the sale in January 2015, Dana has no remaining investment in Venezuela.\nStructural Products Business - In 2010, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our Structural Products business to Metalsa S.A. de C.V. (Metalsa) and reached a final agreement with the buyer on disputed issues in May 2014. Prior to the third quarter of 2012, Structural Products was reported as an operating segment of continuing operations. With the cessation of the retained operations in the third quarter of 2012, we began reporting the activities relating to the Structural Products business as discontinued operations. Legal and other costs incurred in 2014 to settle a customer complaint and the\nremaining disputes with Metalsa and insurance recoveries in 2015 related to previously outstanding claims have extended the reporting of discontinued operations.\nSegments\nWe manage our operations globally through four operating segments. Our Light Vehicle and Power Technologies segments primarily support light vehicle original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) with products for light trucks, SUVs, CUVs, vans and passenger cars. The Commercial Vehicle segment supports the OEMs of on-highway commercial vehicles (primarily trucks and buses), while our Off-Highway segment supports OEMs of off-highway vehicles (primarily wheeled vehicles used in construction, mining and agricultural applications).\nTrends in Our Markets\nGlobal Vehicle Production\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

</tr>\n</table>\nNorth America\nLight vehicle markets - Improving economic conditions during the past few years have contributed to increased light vehicle sales and production levels in North America. Overall economic conditions in North America continue to be relatively favorable with improving employment levels and upward trending consumer confidence. After increasing by about 1% in 2016 from 2015, the North America light vehicle market begun to show signs of weakening demand levels this past year as strong sales levels the past few years have significantly reduced the built-up demand to replace older vehicles. As such, 2017 light vehicle sales declined about 2% from 2016. Within the light vehicle segment, passenger car sales declined around 5% in 2016, and another 9% in 2017. In part due to comparatively low fuel prices when compared with recent years, demand for light trucks and SUVs continued to be strong, increasing about 7% in 2016 and 4% in 2017. Many of our customer programs are focused in the full frame light truck segment. Sales in this segment increased 6% in 2016 and another 3% in 2017. Production levels were generally reflective of light vehicle sales. Production of 17.8 million light vehicles in 2016 was 2% higher than 2015, with 2017 light vehicle production coming in at approximately 17.1 million units - down 4% from 2016. Light vehicle engine production was impacted more by the developments in the passenger car segment, with production in 2017 declining about 7% versus\n2016 after increasing 3% year-over-year in 2016. In the key full frame light truck segment, production levels in 2017 increased about 3% compared to 2016 following an increase of 7% in 2016 from the preceding year. Days' supply of total light vehicles in the U.S. at the end of December the past three years has been around 61 to 62 days. In the full frame light truck segment, days supply in inventory at December 31, 2017 approximated 64 days, down slightly from 65 days at December 31, 2016 and up from 62 days at the end of December 2015.\nLight truck markets are expected to remain relatively strong given the positive North America economic environment that is expected to drive continued growth in manufacturing and construction activities in 2018. Rising interest rates, less pent-up demand, higher levels of consumer debt and declining used car prices may constrict demand. We expect Dana sales will continue to benefit from strong market demand for key vehicles that we supply which launched within the past two years. Our current outlook for 2018 has full frame light truck production at 4.0 to 4.3 million vehicles, comparable to down 8% with 2017 production of about 4.3 million vehicles. We expect light vehicle engine production in 2018 to be 14.8 to 15.1 million units, comparable to up slightly compared to this past year.\nMedium/heavy vehicle markets - The commercial vehicle market is similarly impacted by many of the same macroeconomic developments impacting the light vehicle market. Strong production levels in the heavy truck segment in 2014 and first half of 2015 led to more trucks than required to meet freight demand. As a consequence, production levels in 2016 were scaled back. Class 8 heavy truck production in 2016 declined 29% from 2015, while Classes 5-7 medium truck build was relatively comparable. The North American economy gaining strength in 2017 has led to increased freight-hauling demand and a strengthening order book for new Class 8 trucks. During 2017, heavy duty Class 8 truck production was up approximately 12% while medium duty Classes 5-7 truck production was up 6% compared with 2016.\nClass 8 order levels increased significantly during the second half of 2017, positioning 2018 to be a strong production year. With the strong Class 8 order book and an expectation that the North America economic environment will continue to be strong in 2018, our outlook for 2018 Class 8 production in North America is 290,000 to 310,000 trucks, a level which is up about 14 to 22% compared with the 2017 build level. In the medium duty segment, we expect full year 2018 production to be in the range of 245,000 to 255,000 vehicles, comparable to up 4% from 2017.\nMarkets Outside of North America\nLight vehicle markets - Signs of an improved overall European economy have been evident, albeit mixed at times, during the past few years. While improving modestly in 2015 and 2016, signs of a strengthening economic climate were evident in 2017. Reflective of an improved economic environment, light vehicle engine production was up about 3% in both 2016 and 2017 and light truck production was higher by 9 to 10% in each of the past two years. The United Kingdom's decision to withdraw from the European Union, along with political developments in other European countries, continues to cast an element of uncertainty around continued economic improvement in the region. At present, we expect overall stable to improving economic conditions across the entire region in 2018. Our full year 2018 outlook expects an increase in light truck and light vehicle engine production of around 3 to 6% from 2017. The economic climate in many South American markets the past few years has been weak, volatile and challenging. After significant production declines in 2014 and 2015, there were signs that demand levels had bottomed out in 2016. Production levels in 2017 were reflective of an improving market, with light vehicle engine production up 14% and light truck production up 26% compared to 2016. At present, we expect further economic recovery in the region in 2018. Our full year 2018 outlook has light truck production increasing 5 to 21% from 2017, with light vehicle engine production up 10 to 14% compared to this past year. The Asia Pacific markets have been relatively strong the past few years. Light truck production increased 8% in 2015 and was up another 14% in 2016, while light vehicle engine production increased 2% in 2015 and another 7% in 2016. Further production increases occurred this past year, with 2017 light truck production up 7% and light vehicle engine build up 4%. Our full year 2018 outlook for the Asia Pacific light vehicle markets is for continued strong production levels, with the light truck segment up 1 to 5% from 2017 and light engine production being comparable to up 2%.\nMedium/heavy vehicle markets - Some of the same factors referenced above that affected light vehicle markets outside of North America similarly affected the medium/heavy markets. A strengthening European market the past three years contributed to medium/heavy truck production increasing 9% in 2015, 7% in 2016 and another 5% in 2017. Our 2018 full year outlook anticipates continued strong production at levels relatively comparable with 2017. A weakening South America economic climate beginning in 2014 led to medium/heavy truck production declining 47% in 2015 and another 20% in 2016. As with the light vehicle markets, improving economic conditions in the region led to medium/heavy truck production in 2017 being up about 28% from the preceding year. We expect that"}
