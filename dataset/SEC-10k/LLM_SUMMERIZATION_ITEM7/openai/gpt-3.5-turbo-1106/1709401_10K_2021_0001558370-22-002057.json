Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nObjective\nThe purpose of the following discussion and analysis is to provide material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations from management's perspective, including to describe and explain key trends, events and other factors that impacted our reported results and that are reasonably likely to impact our future performance.\nAs such, the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that is biologically engineering red blood cells or RBCs, to develop an entirely new class of cellular medicines called Red Cell Therapeutics, or RCTs, for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. Based on our vision that human red blood cells are the foundation of the next significant innovation in medicine, we have developed a programmable and highly versatile platform, which we call the RED PLATFORM, to biologically engineer and culture allogeneic cellular therapies that enable multiple applications, or modalities. We believe that the advantage of the platform is that once a modality is validated, as we have demonstrated with our lead product candidate RTX-240 for the treatment of advanced cancers, we increase the likelihood that all the programs within that modality will work, underscoring the broad potential of the RED PLATFORM to help patients.\nIn 2021, we demonstrated strong execution across our pipeline of RCTs. During the year, we presented initial clinical data from our Phase 1 trial with RTX-240 in patients with relapsed refractory solid tumors, which we believe provides clinical validation for our RED platform. Over the course of the year, we advanced enrollment in all our Phase 1studies for RTX-240 in solid tumors and AML, as well as our second program, RTX-321 in patients with HPV 16-positive tumors. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we received IND clearance for our third oncology program, RTX-224, our second broad immune agonist. In January 2022, we began dosing patients in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of RTX-224 for the treatment of patients with certain relapsed/refractory or locally advanced solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer, cutaneous melanoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, urothelial (bladder) carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer.\nAt our Investor Day in December 2021, we shared preclinical proof of concept data, demonstrating tolerance induction and the potential for bystander suppression in two stringent type 1 diabetes preclinical models. These findings are potentially translatable beyond type 1 diabetes to multiple autoimmune diseases, including our priority target indications such as multiple sclerosis and celiac disease.\nIn 2021, we continued to advance our manufacturing capabilities and achieved significant manufacturing milestones, including increased cells produced per batch in 50L bioreactors by four times that of 2020 and providing uninterrupted clinical supply for three Phase 1 arms of the RTX-240 clinical trial and for the Phase 1 RTX-321 trial. We have the potential to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities and plan to stage additional investments based on future needs and in preparation for potential pivotal trial and eventual commercialization.\nHighlights of our clinical product candidates, RTX-240, RTX-321and RTX-224 are described further below.\nBroad Immune Stimulation for the Treatment of Cancer\nRTX-240\nIn March 2021, we announced initial clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of RTX-240 in advanced solid tumors that we believe provides clinical validation of the RED PLATFORM's potential ability to engineer red blood cells to mimic the human immune system and stimulate adaptive and innate immunity to generate clinical responses in cancer patients with refractory disease. RTX-240 is an allogeneic, off-the-shelf cellular therapy product candidate that is engineered to simultaneously present hundreds of thousands of copies of the costimulatory molecule 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) and IL-15TP (trans-presentation of IL-15 on IL-15R\u03b1) in their native forms. RTX-240 is designed to broadly stimulate the immune system by activating and expanding both NK and CD8+ memory T cells to generate a potent anti-tumor response.\nThe data reported in March 2021 included initial safety (n=16) and efficacy (n=15) data from the RTX-240 Phase 1/2 clinical trial in relapsed/refractory or locally advanced solid tumors. These data were also presented at the American Association for Cancer Research Virtual Annual Meeting in April 2021. Five dose cohorts were completed at the time of the data cutoff on February 28, 2021, and the data analysis was based on RECIST v1.1. criteria. We observed the following:\nTable 357: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>no treatment-related Grade 3 or Grade 4 adverse events or dose limiting toxicities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 358: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>most common treatment-related Grade 1/2 adverse events were fatigue, chills, nausea, decreased appetite and arthralgias. There was a single Grade 1 event of liver toxicity; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 359: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>two responses were observed in the study including a confirmed partial response, or PR, in a patient with metastatic anal cancer, and an unconfirmed PR in a patient with metastatic uveal melanoma. Both patients' diseases had progressed on prior anti PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 therapy, respectively; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 360: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>stable disease, or SD, was observed in six patients, including four patients with stable disease for at least 12 weeks in non-small cell lung cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 361: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>pharmacodynamic effects showed the activation and/or expansion of the key NK and/or T cells types in all patients (n=16). </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFurther, preliminary data from the single agent solid tumor arm of our RTX-240 Phase 1 study that we reported in March 2021 showed early evidence of favorable immune-permissive changes in the tumor microenvironment, or TME, in three out of four patient biopsies, including increased expression of PD-L1 and/or increased ratio of M1/M2 macrophages after treatment with RTX-240, suggesting single-agent RTX-240 is able to induce changes in the TME that have been associated with response to checkpoint inhibition.\nAs a result of no dose-limiting toxicities, or DLTs, and a clear NK cell number dose response and other pharmacodynamic effects, we are continuing to dose escalate the single-agent RTX-240 solid tumor trial and expect to report clinical results for this trial, along with an integrated clinical development plan during the first quarter of 2022.\nIn March 2021, we presented preliminary trafficking data from the first acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, patient in the Phase 1 arm of the ongoing RTX-240 clinical trial for the treatment of relapsed/refractory AML, showing accumulation of activated, granzyme B-positive NK and T cells in the bone marrow, which is the site of disease in AML. We plan to report additional results from this arm of the ongoing RTX-240 clinical trial during the first quarter of 2022.\nIn June 2021, we began dosing patients in the arm of our RTX-240 clinical trial that is evaluating RTX-240 as a combination therapy with pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory or locally advanced solid tumors. We believe that RTX-240, with its mechanism of action as a broad immune agonist, may have synergy with\nimmune checkpoint inhibition and could potentially overcome resistance to PD-1 inhibition. We expect to report initial clinical results from this arm of the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical of RTX-240 during the second half of 2022.\nIn July 2021, the paper entitled Anti-Tumor Effects of RTX-240: An Engineered Red Blood Cell Expressing 4-1BB Ligand and Interleukin-15\u201d was published in the peer-reviewed journal Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy. The publication highlights preclinical findings and demonstrates that, consistent with the data reported in March 2021, RTX-240 activates and expands CD8+ T cells and NK cells in vitro and in vivo generating potent anti-tumor activity in both a colorectal and melanoma model.\nRTX-224\nRTX-224 is an allogeneic cellular therapy that is engineered to express hundreds of thousands of copies of 4-1BBL and interleukin-12, or IL-12, on the cell surface. RTX-224 is designed as a broad immune agonist of both adaptive and innate responses, designed to activate CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, activate and expand NK cells, and promote antigen presentation. It is expected to produce a broad and potent anti-tumor T cell response and an innate immune response and have anti-tumor activity in those tumor types with known sensitivity to T cell killing, including tumor types with high mutational burden, PD-L1 expression and known responsiveness to checkpoint inhibitors. The combination of IL-12 and 4-1BBL has the potential to broadly induce an immune response in patients with solid tumors and may serve as the bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems.\nIn November 2021, we presented preclinical data for RTX-224 at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer's 36th Annual Meeting, showing that RTX-224 activated immune cells in the spleen and blood, leading to their trafficking into the tumor microenvironment to deliver an anti-tumor effect in our preclinical models.\nThe IND for RTX-224 was cleared in 2021, and, in January 2022, we began dosing patients in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of RTX-224 for the treatment of patients with certain relapsed/refractory or locally advanced solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer, cutaneous melanoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, urothelial (bladder) carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer.\nAntigen-Specific Immune Stimulation for the Treatment of Cancer\nRTX-321\nRTX-321 is an allogeneic, off-the-shelf artificial antigen presenting cells, or aAPC, therapy product candidate that is engineered to induce a tumor-specific immune response by expanding antigen-specific T cells. RTX-321 expresses hundreds of thousands of copies of an HPV 16 peptide antigen bound to major histocompatibility complex class I proteins, the costimulatory molecule 4-1BBL and the cytokine IL-12 on the cell surface to mimic human T cell-APC interactions. In our Investigational New Drug, or IND, application filing, we included frozen drug substance for the first\ntime as part of the manufacturing process, allowing for a truly off-the-shelf cellular therapy product candidate with a potential shelf life of several years.\nIn May 2021, a peer-reviewed manuscript about RTX-321 was published in Nature Communications, highlighting preclinical findings demonstrating that the surrogate model of RTX-321 induced a broad immune response, epitope spreading and memory formation in preclinical studies.\nWe began dosing patients in the Phase 1 clinical trial of RTX-321 in April 2021. As of January 2022, there have been no DLTs observed and we are therefore continuing to dose escalate the trial. We expect to report initial results from the trial during the second half of 2022.\nAntigen-Specific Immune Tolerance for the Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases\nRTX-T1D (Type 1 Diabetes)\nIn December 2021, we shared preclinical proof of concept data, demonstrating tolerance induction and the potential for bystander suppression in two stringent type 1 diabetes preclinical models. Specifically, we established efficacy in the BDC2.5 adoptive transfer model with data showing that an RTX-T1D surrogate reversed established inflammation and induced two types of regulatory T cells, resulting in protection against re-challenge. Moreover, the data showed that repeated dosing could extend duration of disease protection to 5 months (the endpoint of the study). We also showed early efficacy in the non-obese diabetic mouse, or NOD, preclinical model. Results at 25 weeks showed that a mouse surrogate of RTX-T1D that delivered only two antigens delayed disease. As disease in NOD mice is caused by many autoantigens, these results demonstrate the potential for bystander suppression. These findings are potentially translatable beyond type 1 diabetes to multiple autoimmune diseases, including other Rubius' high priority target indications such as multiple sclerosis and celiac disease.\nWe intend to present these results in a peer-reviewed setting and expect to provide details of our development timeline later in 2022.\nManufacturing\nUsing our RED PLATFORM, we are utilizing our universal engineering and manufacturing processes to advance a broad pipeline of RCT product candidates into clinical trials in cancer and autoimmune diseases. Common design and manufacturing elements of our RCTs should enable us to achieve significant advantages in product development.\nTo more efficiently develop new RCTs designed to treat different diseases, we have modified one of our initial manufacturing steps in which we add a gene or genes of interest that encode biotherapeutic proteins within the cell or on the cell surface. Using this approach, we have expressed more than 1,000 different therapeutic proteins since platform inception. This programmable process allows for the repeated generation of product candidates and enables us to leverage common CMC and toxicology data packages across our therapies.\nRecognizing the importance of controlling our own manufacturing capabilities to produce consistent and reproducible product at greater scale, we acquired, renovated and operationalized a manufacturing facility in Smithfield, RI, that is currently providing cGMP supply for our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials: RTX-240 in advanced solid tumors, RTX-240 in relapsed/refractory AML, RTX-240 in combination with pembrolizumab, RTX-321 in HPV 16-positive cancers and RTX-224 in advanced solid tumors.\nWe have industrialized the production of RCTs by developing and scaling up a manufacturing process by which hematopoietic progenitor cells are expanded, then biologically engineered and subsequently differentiated into erythroid cells (RCTs) that express biotherapeutic proteins within the cell or on the cell surface. The RED PLATFORM allows us to generate a wide variety of allogeneic, ready-to-use RCT product candidates with a universal and proprietary process.\nIn 2021, we achieved the following manufacturing milestones:\nTable 362: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>increased cells produced per batch in 50L bioreactors by four times that of 2020, enabling uninterrupted clinical supply for three Phase 1 arms of the RTX-240 clinical trial and for the Phase 1 RTX-321 trial; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 363: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>introduced frozen drug substance for RTX-321 and RTX-224, potentially enabling inventory storage for more than two years. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditional accomplishments include:\nTable 364: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>greater than 90% lot success rate for RTX-240 and RTX-321 clinical supply; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 365: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>hundreds of doses administered across all three arms of our RTX-240 Phase 1/2 trial and our RTX-321 Phase 1 trial; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 366: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>high transduction efficiency, with greater than 90% of cells transduced with therapeutic proteins; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 367: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>highly consistent protein expression (dual or triple). </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have the potential to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities and plan to stage additional investments based on future needs and in preparation for potential pivotal trial and eventual commercialization.\nSince our inception, we have focused substantially all of our resources on building our proprietary RED PLATFORM, establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research and development activities, developing our manufacturing process and manufacturing drug product material, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. To date, we have funded our operations with proceeds from the sale of preferred stock and issuance of debt and with proceeds from our public offerings.\nOn July 20, 2018, we completed our IPO pursuant to which we issued and sold 12,055,450 shares of common stock, inclusive of 1,572,450 shares pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. We received proceeds of $254.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs. In August 2019, we entered into a Distribution Agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Jefferies LLC and SVB Leerink LLC with respect to an at-the-market, or ATM, offering program under which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock, having aggregate gross proceeds of up to $100.0 million. We have not yet sold any shares of our common stock under the ATM offering program. In March 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering, or the March 2021 Offering, pursuant to which we issued and sold 6,896,552 shares of common stock. We received proceeds of $187.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate any product revenue or product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. We reported net losses of $196.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $167.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $677.0 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our expenses and capital requirements will increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if, and as, we:\nTable 368: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>conduct clinical trials for our product candidates and to the extent we continue to experience delays, setbacks or disruptions to our preclinical studies, clinical trials or clinical supply chain due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 369: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>further develop our RED PLATFORM; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 370: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>continue to discover and develop additional product candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 371: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 372: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>hire additional clinical, scientific, manufacturing and commercial personnel; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 373: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>expand in-house manufacturing capabilities, including through the operation and any future renovation or expansion of our manufacturing facility; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 374: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>establish a commercial manufacturing source and secure supply chain capacity sufficient to provide commercial quantities of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 375: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 376: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 377: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 378: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts, as well as to continue to support the requirements of a public company. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing and distribution. Further, we expect to continue to incur costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public and private equity financings, debt financings, borrowings under our credit facility, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution and licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain funding, we plan to implement an operating plan that scales back our operations and focuses our available capital on a reduced number of activities and programs, which we believe will enable the continued advancement of certain of our research and development programs and the preservation of our technology platform. These actions could adversely affect our business prospects.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $225.8 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2023. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nImpact of the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic\nSince March of 2020 and throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented various precautionary measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, partners and prospective clinical trial participants, to comply with applicable national, state and local governmental orders, proclamations and/or directives in effect at any time aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19 and to minimize disruption to our operations. Such measures have included, at\ncertain times, the elimination of business travel, shifting to remote work wherever possible and implementing rotating laboratory work schedules to reduce the number of people onsite at our facilities, advance ordering of certain raw materials impacted by delays in the global supply chain, as well as working with our external partners and clinical sites to utilize virtual clinical trial site training and monitoring, minimizing patient visits and instituting telemedicine to minimize patient exposure. We will continue to use these and other precautionary measures as required until such time as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including any subsequent outbreak whether or not due to emerging variants thereof, is contained.\nWhile the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted manufacturing, supply chain and clinical trial activities worldwide, including those of our suppliers, vendors and clinical trial sites, these disruptions did not significantly impact our results of operations during 2020 or 2021. The ultimate impact on our operations, however, is unknown and will depend on future developments, such as the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic, among others, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. In particular, global developments concerning COVID-19, including the identification of new strains of coronavirus, and the magnitude of interventions to contain the spread of viruses, such as government-mandated quarantines, shelter-in-place mandates, restrictions on travel, shutdowns for non-essential businesses, requirements regarding social distancing, impact of government-imposed restrictions on the global supply chain, including through use of the Defense Production Act, distribution of vaccines and other public health safety measures, will determine the impact of the pandemic on our business. We are continuing to monitor the latest developments regarding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. However, any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time and may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent Developments\nDuring 2021, we strengthened our leadership team by appointing Dannielle Appelhans as Chief Operating Officer. Ms. Appelhans brings significant experience in building organizations as they evolve from early- to late-stage development, with a particular focus on clinical and commercial manufacturing and scaling supply chains. Additionally, Dr. Laurance Turka has been promoted to chief scientific officer and head of research & translational medicine. Joining Rubius Therapeutics as chief scientific officer in January 2020, Dr. Turka is an internationally recognized physician-scientist in autoimmunity and translational immunology with a distinguished career working in academia and, more recently, in the biotechnology industry where he has built a portfolio of novel therapies targeting immune cells.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval or license or collaboration agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales, payments from collaboration or license agreements that we may enter into with third parties, or any combination thereof.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development and manufacturing of our product candidates, which include:\nTable 379: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 380: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates and research programs, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and contract research organizations, or CROs; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 381: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>the cost of developing and scaling our manufacturing process and manufacturing drug products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including those produced in our manufacturing facility as well as components that are produced under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and any contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, that we may engage; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 382: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>laboratory supplies and research materials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 383: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 384: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>payments made under third-party licensing agreements. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nOur direct research, manufacturing and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis for clinical candidates. These consist mostly of fees, reimbursed materials, testing and other costs paid to consultants, contractors, CMOs and CROs, as well as the cost of materials incurred for internal manufacturing. In addition, starting in the first quarter of 2020, we allocate the cost of operating our manufacturing facility to research and development program costs, consisting of associated personnel costs, other than stock-based compensation expense, and manufacturing facility costs, including depreciation. We do not allocate costs associated with our platform development, early stage research and shared research and development, including associated personnel costs, laboratory supplies, non-manufacturing facilities expenses and other indirect costs, to research and development programs, because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and our technology platform and, as such, are not separately classified.\nProduct candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially over time in connection with our planned preclinical and clinical development activities in the future. At this time, we cannot accurately estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the following:\nTable 385: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 386: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 387: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>our ability to raise the additional funds necessary to complete preclinical and clinical development of and commercialize our drug candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 388: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we may enter into collaboration arrangements; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 389: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 390: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 391: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>the successful initiation and completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or any comparable foreign regulatory authority; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 392: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 393: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>the receipt and related terms of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 394: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>the availability of specialty raw materials for use in production of our product candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 395: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>our ability to consistently manufacture our product candidates for use in clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 396: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>our ability to operate a manufacturing facility, or secure manufacturing supply through relationships with third parties; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 397: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 398: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 399: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>the commercialization of our product candidates, if and when approved; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 400: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>obtaining and maintaining third-party insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 401: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>the acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 402: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>competition with other products; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 403: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>a continued acceptable safety profile of our therapies following approval. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs, as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting and audit services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses may increase in the future as we continue to build infrastructure to support the expansion of our research activities, development of our product candidates and any expanded compliance requirements.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our invested cash balances.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest owed on outstanding borrowings under our Loan Agreement (as defined below), as well as amortization of debt discount.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists of miscellaneous income and expense unrelated to our core operations.\nIncome Taxes\nSince our inception, we have not recorded any income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or for our research and development tax credits generated, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of our net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards and tax credits will not be realized. As of December 31, 2021, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $534.2 million and $534.8 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income. The federal NOLs include $37.2 million, which expire at various dates through 2037, and $497.0 million, which carryforward indefinitely. The state NOLs expire at various dates through 2041. As of December 31, 2021, we also had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $22.7 million and $15.6 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2034 and 2026, respectively. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe

and development expenses were $141.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $116.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in direct costs related to our rare disease program of $5.0 million was due to the decision in March 2020 to deprioritize development of our rare disease programs and discontinue the RTX-134 Phase 1b clinical trial. The increase in direct costs of $28.7 million in our lead cancer programs, including RTX-240 and RTX-321, was principally related to costs incurred for the three arms of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of RTX-240, including CRO costs and internal manufacturing costs, costs incurred for our Phase 1 clinical trial of RTX-321 in patients with advanced HPV 16-positive cancers as well as start-up costs related to our Phase 1 clinical trial of RTX-224. The reduction in contract research and development and laboratory supplies and research materials of $0.7 million and $4.9 million, respectively, was mostly due to the shift from pilot-scale manufacturing activities to manufacturing activities to support the technical development of clinical candidates included in program expenses. The increase in stock-compensation expense of $4.3 million was driven by an increase in the market price of our common stock resulting in a higher valuation of options granted in 2021. Personnel-related costs increased $2.4 million due to headcount additions to support our expanded operations. Finally, facility related and other costs increased by $0.7 million due to increases in building operating costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nTable 406: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel-related\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 13,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 12,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,847\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,370)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional and consultant fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,638\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility related and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,573\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 53,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 50,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,688\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $53.0 million, compared to $50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in general and administrative expenses of $2.7 million was primarily the result of additional personnel-related expenses of $1.8 million resulting from rising headcount in our general and administrative function, including recruitment costs, to support our expanded operations. In addition, the increase in professional and consultant fees of $1.6 million was driven by additional patent costs as we expand our patent portfolio and the increase in facility-related and other expenses of $1.6 million was largely due to higher building operating costs and non-capitalized software costs. These increases were offset by a reduction in stock-based compensation expense of $2.4 million due principally to stock option awards that fully vested during the third quarter of 2021.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest income decreased due to lower prevailing interest rates.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in interest expense was principally due to higher outstanding borrowings and a higher interest rate in connection with our Loan Agreement (as defined below).\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net was $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in other income, net was due to the monetization of certain tax credits during the period.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table summarizes our

million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $112.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in direct costs related to our rare disease program of $19.0 million was due to costs incurred in connection with our Phase 1b clinical trial of RTX-134 in patients with phenylketonuria, which was discontinued in March 2020. The increase in direct costs of $36.6 million in our lead cancer programs, including RTX-240 and RTX-321, was principally related to costs incurred for our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of RTX-240 for the treatment of solid tumors, including clinical CRO and internal manufacturing costs, as well as to costs incurred for preclinical, IND-enabling activities and clinical startup costs for RTX-321. The decrease in contract research and development of $4.6 million was due to the advancement of discovery research to support IND-enabling activities. The decline in laboratory supplies and research materials of $4.2 million was primarily due to the shift in pilot-scale manufacturing activities to support the technical development of clinical candidates. The reduction in stock-compensation expense of $1.0 million was driven by a reduction in the market price of our common stock resulting in a lower valuation of options granted during 2020. The decrease in personnel-related costs and facility related and other costs of $4.2 million was principally due to the allocation of the costs to operate our manufacturing facility to research and development program costs starting in the first quarter of 2020, as well as a reduction in onsite activities in connection with our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nTable 409: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel related\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 12,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 10,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,563\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,618)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional and consultant fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (899)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility related and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (887)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 50,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 57,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (6,841)\n</td> </tr>\n</table> General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $50.3 million, compared to $57.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in general and administrative expenses of $6.8 million was primarily the result of a reduction in stock-based compensation expense of $6.6 million due principally to restricted stock awards that fully vested in January 2020. In addition, the decrease in professional and consultant fees of $0.9 million was driven by reduced spending on business support initiatives. The increase in personnel-related costs of $1.6 million was due to the timing of executive management hiring, as well as executive recruiting costs and compensation. The decrease in facility-related and other expenses of $0.9 million was largely driven by decreased spending for business support initiatives and a reduction in onsite activities in connection with our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest income decreased due to reduced invested balances as cash was used to fund operations, as well as reduced interest rates.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in interest expense was principally due to higher outstanding borrowings in connection with our Loan Agreement (as defined below).\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income, net was $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other income, net primarily increased as a result of income earned from a sublease agreement that commenced February 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any product candidates for several years, if at all. To date, we have funded our operations with proceeds from the sale of preferred stock, with the issuance of debt, with proceeds from our IPO and, most recently, with proceeds from our March 2021 Offering, described further below. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $225.8 million. In July 2018, we completed our IPO, pursuant to which we issued and sold 12,055,450 shares of common stock, inclusive of 1,572,450 shares pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. We received proceeds of $254.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs. In December 2018, we entered into a loan and security agreement, which was amended in June 2021, which provides for aggregate borrowings of up to $75.0 million. As of December 31, 2021, $75.0 million is outstanding under the agreement and principal payments commence in July 2024. In March 2021, we completed the March 2021 Offering, pursuant to which we issued and sold 6,896,552 shares of common stock. We received proceeds of $187.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:\nTable 410: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (145,122)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (127,648)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (110,444)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (132,635)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 198,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,291\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 134,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (732)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (215,788)\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Operating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, operating activities used $145.1 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $196.5 million, partially offset by net non-cash charges of $44.7 million, predominantly consisting of stock-based compensation expense. Net cash used in our operating assets and liabilities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 consisted of a $0.1 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, other long-term liabilities and operating lease liabilities, offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, other assets and operating lease, right-of-use asset of $6.6 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities used $127.6 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $167.7 million, partially offset by net non-cash charges of $40.0 million, predominantly consisting of stock-based compensation expense. Net cash used in our operating assets and liabilities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 consisted of a $6.5 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, other long-term liabilities and operating lease liabilities, offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, other assets and operating lease, right-of-use asset of $6.6 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities used $110.4 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $163.5 million, partially offset by net non-cash charges of $42.6 million, primarily consisting of stock-based compensation expense. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2019 provided cash of $10.4 million consisting primarily of a $5.5 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, a $5.0 million increase in operating lease, right-of-use asset, and a $2.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, offset by a $2.7 million decrease in operating lease liabilities.\nChanges in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and prepaid expenses and other current assets in all periods presented were generally due to growth in our business, the advancement of our research programs and the timing of vendor invoicing and payments.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by investing activities was $81.4 million, consisting of sales and maturities of investments of $85.0 million, offset by purchases of property, plant and equipment of $3.6 million. Our cash purchases of property, plant and equipment primarily relate to the purchase of computer and laboratory equipment installed in our manufacturing facility in Smithfield, Rhode Island and our laboratory space in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by investing activities was $100.4 million, consisting of sales and maturities of investments of $228.6 million, offset by net purchases of investments of $122.7 million and purchases of property, plant and equipment of $5.5 million. Our cash purchases of property, plant and equipment consisted of $2.9 million for purchases related to our manufacturing facility in Smithfield, Rhode Island, largely driven by payments for manufacturing equipment purchases and construction costs incurred in 2019, and $2.6 million for the purchase of computer and laboratory equipment installed in our manufacturing facility and our laboratory space in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $132.6 million, consisting of purchases of investments of $319.1 million and purchases of property, plant and equipment of $40.7 million, offset by sales and maturities of investments of $227.2 million. Our purchases of property, plant and equipment primarily consisted of $29.8 million related to the renovation and customization of our manufacturing facility in Smithfield, Rhode Island, and $8.5 million for the purchase of laboratory equipment as we expanded our discovery and technical development activities.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities of $198.5 million consisted primarily of proceeds of $187.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs, from the March 2021 Offering, as well as proceeds received from issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options and under the employee stock purchase plan of $11.0 million. Net cash used in financing activities includes $0.4 million of offering cost payments in connection with the March 2021 Offering and $0.2 million of debt issuance cost payments related to our Loan Agreement (as defined below) in June 2021.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities of $26.5 million consisted of $25.0 million proceeds received from borrowings under our Loan Agreement and $1.5 million proceeds received from issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities of $27.3 million consisted of $25.0 million proceeds received from borrowings under our Loan Agreement and $2.4 million proceeds received from issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nTable 411: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease commitments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 46,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 9,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 15,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 15,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,199\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 145,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 14,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 44,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 79,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,199\n</td> </tr>\n</table> (1)Amounts in table reflect payments due for our leases of office and laboratory space in Cambridge, Massachusetts under two operating lease agreements that expire in January 2027 and August 2028.\n(2)Amounts in table reflect the contractually required principal and interest payments payable under the Loan Agreement. For purposes of this table, the interest due under the Loan Agreement was calculated using an assumed interest rate of 8.86% per annum, which was the interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2021.\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, CMOs and other third parties for preclinical research studies, assay development, clinical trials, manufacturing and testing services. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable by us upon prior written notice. Payments due upon cancellation typically consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including noncancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation. These payments are not included in the table above as the amount and timing of such payments are not known.\nWe have also entered into a license agreement with the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, or WIBR, as amended, under which we have been granted an exclusive, sublicensable, nontransferable license under certain patent families related to the development of our RCTs, or the WIBR License. We are obligated to pay to WIBR low\nsingle-digit royalties based on annual net sales by us, our affiliates and our sublicensees of licensed products and licensed services that are covered by a valid claim of the licensed patent rights at the time and in the country of sale. Based on the progress we make in the advancement of products covered by the licensed patent rights, we are required to make aggregate milestone payments of up to $1.6 million upon the achievement of specified preclinical, clinical and regulatory milestones. In addition, we are required to pay to WIBR a percentage of the non-royalty payments that we receive from sublicensees of the patent rights licensed by WIBR. This percentage varies from low single-digit to low double-digit percentages and will be based upon the clinical stage of the product that is the subject of the sublicense. Royalties shall be paid by us on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, beginning on the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country until expiration of the last valid patent claim covering such licensed product in such country.\nWe have the right to terminate the WIBR License in its entirety, on a patent-by-patent or country-by-country basis, at will upon three months' notice to WIBR. WIBR may terminate the agreement upon breach of contract or in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation, insolvency or cessation of business related to the license. For additional information, see Business-Licenses.\u201d\nLoan and Security Agreements\nIn December 2018, or the Closing Date, we entered into a loan and security agreement, or, as amended, the Loan Agreement, with SLR Investment Corp. (formerly Solar Capital Ltd.) as collateral agent for the lenders party thereto for an aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million. The aggregate principal amount was funded in three tranches of term loans of $25.0 million each, on the Closing Date, in June 2019 and in June 2020.\nOn June 22, 2021, or the Amendment Closing Date, we entered into an amendment, or the Amendment, to our Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the Amendment, we and our lenders agreed to extend the interest-only period in respect of our borrowings under the Loan Agreement from December 21, 2021 until July 1, 2024. The parties also agreed to extend the final maturity date on which all of our outstanding obligations under the Loan Agreement become due to June 1, 2026 (from December 21, 2023 originally). An additional tranche in the amount of $35.0 million is available to us prior to the final maturity date, to be provided at the sole discretion of the lenders. Interest on the outstanding loan balance will accrue at a rate of 5.50%, plus the greater of 2.10% or the one-month U.S. LIBOR rate. Monthly principal payments will commence on July 1, 2024 and will be amortized over the following 24 months. Certain back-end fees are due to the lender at the time of final repayment based on the total funded term loans. The term loans are subject to a prepayment fee of 1.00% if prepayment occurs within the first year subsequent to the Amendment Closing Date, 0.50% in the second year and 0.25% in the third year through final maturity date.\nThe Loan Agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain either a certain minimum cash balance or a minimum market capitalization threshold. We were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of December 31, 2021. The Loan Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants and also includes customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of covenants, change of control and a material adverse change default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 4.00% per annum may be applied to the outstanding loan balances, and the lenders may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable. Borrowings under the Loan Agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets, other than our intellectual property.\nCommon Stock Sales Agreement\nOn August 1, 2019, we entered into a Distribution Agreement (the Distribution Agreement\u201d), with multiple sales agents, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell to or through the agents, from time to time, shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $100.0 million. Sales, if any, of the Company's shares of common stock will be made primarily in at-the-market\u201d offerings, as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The shares of common stock will be offered and sold pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 and a related prospectus supplement, both filed with the SEC on August 1, 2019. We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds from any sale of shares of the Company's common stock for working capital and\nother general corporate purposes. There have been no shares of the Company's common stock sold under the Distribution Agreement as of December 31, 2021.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase substantially in the future as we conduct the activities necessary to advance our product candidates through development. The timing and amount of our operating and capital expenditures will depend largely on:\nTable 412: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 413: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>the commencement, enrollment or results of the planned clinical trials of our product candidates or any future clinical trials we may conduct, or changes in the development status of our product candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 414: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>the timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 415: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including from any subsequent outbreak whether or not due to emerging variants thereof, on our operations; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 416: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>our decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 417: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>changes in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 418: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>developments concerning our key vendors; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 419: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>our ability to obtain materials to produce adequate product supply for any approved product or inability to do so at acceptable prices; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 420: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>the costs associated with the operation of our multi-suite manufacturing facility and the costs and timing of any future renovation or expansion of the facility; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 421: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>our ability to establish collaborations if needed; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 422: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 423: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>the legal patent costs involved in prosecuting patent applications and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property claims; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 424: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 425: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>unanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of our product candidates; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 426: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>the terms and timing of any collaboration, license or other arrangement, including the terms and timing of any milestone payments thereunder. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBefore consideration of management's plans described below, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2023. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public and private equity financings, debt financings, borrowings under our credit facility, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, investors' ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect investors' rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or drug candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to obtain funding, we will implement an operating plan that scales back our operations and focuses our available capital on a reduced number of activities and programs, which we believe will enable the continued advancement of certain of our research and development programs and the preservation of our technology platform. These actions could adversely affect our business prospects. Based on our current cash and cash equivalents, and after considering management's plans described above, we have the ability to fund our operating costs and working capital needs into the middle of 2023.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of the estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\nTable 427: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>vendors in connection with preclinical and assay development activities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 428: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>CMOs in connection with raw material acquisition; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 429: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>CROs in connection with clinical trials. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe base the expense recorded related to contract research and manufacturing on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CMOs and CROs that supply materials and conduct services. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe measure stock-based awards with service-based and performance-based vesting conditions granted to employees, directors and non-employees based on their fair value on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for options or the difference between the purchase price per share of the award, if any, and the fair value of our common stock for restricted common stock awards. Compensation expense for those awards is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We use the straight-line method to record the expense of awards with service-based vesting conditions. We use the graded-vesting method to record the expense of awards with both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions, commencing when achievement of the performance condition becomes probable.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our common stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our common stock options, and our expected dividend yield.\nWe measure the fair value of stock-based awards with market-based vesting conditions on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. When service-based vesting conditions also exist, we recognize stock-based compensation expense using the graded-vesting method over the longer of the derived service period from the market condition or the required service period. In accordance with accounting guidance for awards with market conditions, the stock-based compensation expense will be recognized over the appropriate period regardless of whether the award achieves the market condition and will only be adjusted to the extent the service condition is not met. When an award contains a market-based vesting condition and a performance-based vesting condition where both must be achieved to earn the award, we recognize stock-based compensation expense over the longer of the derived service period from the market condition or the period estimated for the performance-based vesting condition to be achieved. We begin recording stock-based compensation expense for this type of award when the achievement of the performance-based vesting condition becomes probable regardless of whether the market condition has been achieved.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nA description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows are disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company's activities, focusing on its Red Cell Therapeutics for cancer and autoimmune diseases. The company reported strong progress in its clinical trials, particularly with its lead product candidate RTX-240, demonstrating initial safety and efficacy data. The report also outlines the company's achievements in manufacturing capabilities, financial performance, and future funding requirements. The impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and its efforts to mitigate potential disruptions are also discussed. Additionally, the report outlines the company's increased expenses and the uncertain timing and costs associated with the development of its product candidates.", "item_7_tables": "", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nObjective\nThe purpose of the following discussion and analysis is to provide material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations from management's perspective, including to describe and explain key trends, events and other factors that impacted our reported results and that are reasonably likely to impact our future performance.\nAs such, the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that is biologically engineering red blood cells or RBCs, to develop an entirely new class of cellular medicines called Red Cell Therapeutics, or RCTs, for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. Based on our vision that human red blood cells are the foundation of the next significant innovation in medicine, we have developed a programmable and highly versatile platform, which we call the RED PLATFORM, to biologically engineer and culture allogeneic cellular therapies that enable multiple applications, or modalities. We believe that the advantage of the platform is that once a modality is validated, as we have demonstrated with our lead product candidate RTX-240 for the treatment of advanced cancers, we increase the likelihood that all the programs within that modality will work, underscoring the broad potential of the RED PLATFORM to help patients.\nIn 2021, we demonstrated strong execution across our pipeline of RCTs. During the year, we presented initial clinical data from our Phase 1 trial with RTX-240 in patients with relapsed refractory solid tumors, which we believe provides clinical validation for our RED platform. Over the course of the year, we advanced enrollment in all our Phase 1studies for RTX-240 in solid tumors and AML, as well as our second program, RTX-321 in patients with HPV 16-positive tumors. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we received IND clearance for our third oncology program, RTX-224, our second broad immune agonist. In January 2022, we began dosing patients in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of RTX-224 for the treatment of patients with certain relapsed/refractory or locally advanced solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer, cutaneous melanoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, urothelial (bladder) carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer.\nAt our Investor Day in December 2021, we shared preclinical proof of concept data, demonstrating tolerance induction and the potential for bystander suppression in two stringent type 1 diabetes preclinical models. These findings are potentially translatable beyond type 1 diabetes to multiple autoimmune diseases, including our priority target indications such as multiple sclerosis and celiac disease.\nIn 2021, we continued to advance our manufacturing capabilities and achieved significant manufacturing milestones, including increased cells produced per batch in 50L bioreactors by four times that of 2020 and providing uninterrupted clinical supply for three Phase 1 arms of the RTX-240 clinical trial and for the Phase 1 RTX-321 trial. We have the potential to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities and plan to stage additional investments based on future needs and in preparation for potential pivotal trial and eventual commercialization.\nHighlights of our clinical product candidates, RTX-240, RTX-321and RTX-224 are described further below.\nBroad Immune Stimulation for the Treatment of Cancer\nRTX-240\nIn March 2021, we announced initial clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of RTX-240 in advanced solid tumors that we believe provides clinical validation of the RED PLATFORM's potential ability to engineer red blood cells to mimic the human immune system and stimulate adaptive and innate immunity to generate clinical responses in cancer patients with refractory disease. RTX-240 is an allogeneic, off-the-shelf cellular therapy product candidate that is engineered to simultaneously present hundreds of thousands of copies of the costimulatory molecule 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) and IL-15TP (trans-presentation of IL-15 on IL-15R\u03b1) in their native forms. RTX-240 is designed to broadly stimulate the immune system by activating and expanding both NK and CD8+ memory T cells to generate a potent anti-tumor response.\nThe data reported in March 2021 included initial safety (n=16) and efficacy (n=15) data from the RTX-240 Phase 1/2 clinical trial in relapsed/refractory or locally advanced solid tumors. These data were also presented at the American Association for Cancer Research Virtual Annual Meeting in April 2021. Five dose cohorts were completed at the time of the data cutoff on February 28, 2021, and the data analysis was based on RECIST v1.1. criteria. We observed the following:\n \u25cf no treatment-related Grade 3 or Grade 4 adverse events or dose limiting toxicities; \n \u25cf most common treatment-related Grade 1/2 adverse events were fatigue, chills, nausea, decreased appetite and arthralgias. There was a single Grade 1 event of liver toxicity; \n \u25cf two responses were observed in the study including a confirmed partial response, or PR, in a patient with metastatic anal cancer, and an unconfirmed PR in a patient with metastatic uveal melanoma. Both patients' diseases had progressed on prior anti PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 therapy, respectively; \n \u25cf stable disease, or SD, was observed in six patients, including four patients with stable disease for at least 12 weeks in non-small cell lung cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer; and \n \u25cf pharmacodynamic effects showed the activation and/or expansion of the key NK and/or T cells types in all patients (n=16). \nFurther, preliminary data from the single agent solid tumor arm of our RTX-240 Phase 1 study that we reported in March 2021 showed early evidence of favorable immune-permissive changes in the tumor microenvironment, or TME, in three out of four patient biopsies, including increased expression of PD-L1 and/or increased ratio of M1/M2 macrophages after treatment with RTX-240, suggesting single-agent RTX-240 is able to induce changes in the TME that have been associated with response to checkpoint inhibition.\nAs a result of no dose-limiting toxicities, or DLTs, and a clear NK cell number dose response and other pharmacodynamic effects, we are continuing to dose escalate the single-agent RTX-240 solid tumor trial and expect to report clinical results for this trial, along with an integrated clinical development plan during the first quarter of 2022.\nIn March 2021, we presented preliminary trafficking data from the first acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, patient in the Phase 1 arm of the ongoing RTX-240 clinical trial for the treatment of relapsed/refractory AML, showing accumulation of activated, granzyme B-positive NK and T cells in the bone marrow, which is the site of disease in AML. We plan to report additional results from this arm of the ongoing RTX-240 clinical trial during the first quarter of 2022.\nIn June 2021, we began dosing patients in the arm of our RTX-240 clinical trial that is evaluating RTX-240 as a combination therapy with pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory or locally advanced solid tumors. We believe that RTX-240, with its mechanism of action as a broad immune agonist, may have synergy with\nimmune checkpoint inhibition and could potentially overcome resistance to PD-1 inhibition. We expect to report initial clinical results from this arm of the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical of RTX-240 during the second half of 2022.\nIn July 2021, the paper entitled Anti-Tumor Effects of RTX-240: An Engineered Red Blood Cell Expressing 4-1BB Ligand and Interleukin-15\u201d was published in the peer-reviewed journal Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy. The publication highlights preclinical findings and demonstrates that, consistent with the data reported in March 2021, RTX-240 activates and expands CD8+ T cells and NK cells in vitro and in vivo generating potent anti-tumor activity in both a colorectal and melanoma model.\nRTX-224\nRTX-224 is an allogeneic cellular therapy that is engineered to express hundreds of thousands of copies of 4-1BBL and interleukin-12, or IL-12, on the cell surface. RTX-224 is designed as a broad immune agonist of both adaptive and innate responses, designed to activate CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, activate and expand NK cells, and promote antigen presentation. It is expected to produce a broad and potent anti-tumor T cell response and an innate immune response and have anti-tumor activity in those tumor types with known sensitivity to T cell killing, including tumor types with high mutational burden, PD-L1 expression and known responsiveness to checkpoint inhibitors. The combination of IL-12 and 4-1BBL has the potential to broadly induce an immune response in patients with solid tumors and may serve as the bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems.\nIn November 2021, we presented preclinical data for RTX-224 at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer's 36th Annual Meeting, showing that RTX-224 activated immune cells in the spleen and blood, leading to their trafficking into the tumor microenvironment to deliver an anti-tumor effect in our preclinical models.\nThe IND for RTX-224 was cleared in 2021, and, in January 2022, we began dosing patients in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of RTX-224 for the treatment of patients with certain relapsed/refractory or locally advanced solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer, cutaneous melanoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, urothelial (bladder) carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer.\nAntigen-Specific Immune Stimulation for the Treatment of Cancer\nRTX-321\nRTX-321 is an allogeneic, off-the-shelf artificial antigen presenting cells, or aAPC, therapy product candidate that is engineered to induce a tumor-specific immune response by expanding antigen-specific T cells. RTX-321 expresses hundreds of thousands of copies of an HPV 16 peptide antigen bound to major histocompatibility complex class I proteins, the costimulatory molecule 4-1BBL and the cytokine IL-12 on the cell surface to mimic human T cell-APC interactions. In our Investigational New Drug, or IND, application filing, we included frozen drug substance for the first\ntime as part of the manufacturing process, allowing for a truly off-the-shelf cellular therapy product candidate with a potential shelf life of several years.\nIn May 2021, a peer-reviewed manuscript about RTX-321 was published in Nature Communications, highlighting preclinical findings demonstrating that the surrogate model of RTX-321 induced a broad immune response, epitope spreading and memory formation in preclinical studies.\nWe began dosing patients in the Phase 1 clinical trial of RTX-321 in April 2021. As of January 2022, there have been no DLTs observed and we are therefore continuing to dose escalate the trial. We expect to report initial results from the trial during the second half of 2022.\nAntigen-Specific Immune Tolerance for the Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases\nRTX-T1D (Type 1 Diabetes)\nIn December 2021, we shared preclinical proof of concept data, demonstrating tolerance induction and the potential for bystander suppression in two stringent type 1 diabetes preclinical models. Specifically, we established efficacy in the BDC2.5 adoptive transfer model with data showing that an RTX-T1D surrogate reversed established inflammation and induced two types of regulatory T cells, resulting in protection against re-challenge. Moreover, the data showed that repeated dosing could extend duration of disease protection to 5 months (the endpoint of the study). We also showed early efficacy in the non-obese diabetic mouse, or NOD, preclinical model. Results at 25 weeks showed that a mouse surrogate of RTX-T1D that delivered only two antigens delayed disease. As disease in NOD mice is caused by many autoantigens, these results demonstrate the potential for bystander suppression. These findings are potentially translatable beyond type 1 diabetes to multiple autoimmune diseases, including other Rubius' high priority target indications such as multiple sclerosis and celiac disease.\nWe intend to present these results in a peer-reviewed setting and expect to provide details of our development timeline later in 2022.\nManufacturing\nUsing our RED PLATFORM, we are utilizing our universal engineering and manufacturing processes to advance a broad pipeline of RCT product candidates into clinical trials in cancer and autoimmune diseases. Common design and manufacturing elements of our RCTs should enable us to achieve significant advantages in product development.\nTo more efficiently develop new RCTs designed to treat different diseases, we have modified one of our initial manufacturing steps in which we add a gene or genes of interest that encode biotherapeutic proteins within the cell or on the cell surface. Using this approach, we have expressed more than 1,000 different therapeutic proteins since platform inception. This programmable process allows for the repeated generation of product candidates and enables us to leverage common CMC and toxicology data packages across our therapies.\nRecognizing the importance of controlling our own manufacturing capabilities to produce consistent and reproducible product at greater scale, we acquired, renovated and operationalized a manufacturing facility in Smithfield, RI, that is currently providing cGMP supply for our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials: RTX-240 in advanced solid tumors, RTX-240 in relapsed/refractory AML, RTX-240 in combination with pembrolizumab, RTX-321 in HPV 16-positive cancers and RTX-224 in advanced solid tumors.\nWe have industrialized the production of RCTs by developing and scaling up a manufacturing process by which hematopoietic progenitor cells are expanded, then biologically engineered and subsequently differentiated into erythroid cells (RCTs) that express biotherapeutic proteins within the cell or on the cell surface. The RED PLATFORM allows us to generate a wide variety of allogeneic, ready-to-use RCT product candidates with a universal and proprietary process.\nIn 2021, we achieved the following manufacturing milestones:\n \u25cf increased cells produced per batch in 50L bioreactors by four times that of 2020, enabling uninterrupted clinical supply for three Phase 1 arms of the RTX-240 clinical trial and for the Phase 1 RTX-321 trial; and \n \u25cf introduced frozen drug substance for RTX-321 and RTX-224, potentially enabling inventory storage for more than two years. \nAdditional accomplishments include:\n \u25cf greater than 90% lot success rate for RTX-240 and RTX-321 clinical supply; \n \u25cf hundreds of doses administered across all three arms of our RTX-240 Phase 1/2 trial and our RTX-321 Phase 1 trial; \n \u25cf high transduction efficiency, with greater than 90% of cells transduced with therapeutic proteins; and \n \u25cf highly consistent protein expression (dual or triple). \nWe have the potential to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities and plan to stage additional investments based on future needs and in preparation for potential pivotal trial and eventual commercialization.\nSince our inception, we have focused substantially all of our resources on building our proprietary RED PLATFORM, establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research and development activities, developing our manufacturing process and manufacturing drug product material, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. To date, we have funded our operations with proceeds from the sale of preferred stock and issuance of debt and with proceeds from our public offerings.\nOn July 20, 2018, we completed our IPO pursuant to which we issued and sold 12,055,450 shares of common stock, inclusive of 1,572,450 shares pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. We received proceeds of $254.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs. In August 2019, we entered into a Distribution Agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Jefferies LLC and SVB Leerink LLC with respect to an at-the-market, or ATM, offering program under which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock, having aggregate gross proceeds of up to $100.0 million. We have not yet sold any shares of our common stock under the ATM offering program. In March 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering, or the March 2021 Offering, pursuant to which we issued and sold 6,896,552 shares of common stock. We received proceeds of $187.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate any product revenue or product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. We reported net losses of $196.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $167.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $677.0 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our expenses and capital requirements will increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if, and as, we:\n \u25cf conduct clinical trials for our product candidates and to the extent we continue to experience delays, setbacks or disruptions to our preclinical studies, clinical trials or clinical supply chain due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; \n \u25cf further develop our RED PLATFORM; \n \u25cf continue to discover and develop additional product candidates; \n \u25cf maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u25cf hire additional clinical, scientific, manufacturing and commercial personnel; \n \u25cf expand in-house manufacturing capabilities, including through the operation and any future renovation or expansion of our manufacturing facility; \n \u25cf establish a commercial manufacturing source and secure supply chain capacity sufficient to provide commercial quantities of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval; \n \u25cf acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; \n \u25cf seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; \n \u25cf establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval; and \n \u25cf add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts, as well as to continue to support the requirements of a public company. \nWe will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing and distribution. Further, we expect to continue to incur costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public and private equity financings, debt financings, borrowings under our credit facility, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution and licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain funding, we plan to implement an operating plan that scales back our operations and focuses our available capital on a reduced number of activities and programs, which we believe will enable the continued advancement of certain of our research and development programs and the preservation of our technology platform. These actions could adversely affect our business prospects.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $225.8 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2023. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nImpact of the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic\nSince March of 2020 and throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented various precautionary measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, partners and prospective clinical trial participants, to comply with applicable national, state and local governmental orders, proclamations and/or directives in effect at any time aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19 and to minimize disruption to our operations. Such measures have included, at\ncertain times, the elimination of business travel, shifting to remote work wherever possible and implementing rotating laboratory work schedules to reduce the number of people onsite at our facilities, advance ordering of certain raw materials impacted by delays in the global supply chain, as well as working with our external partners and clinical sites to utilize virtual clinical trial site training and monitoring, minimizing patient visits and instituting telemedicine to minimize patient exposure. We will continue to use these and other precautionary measures as required until such time as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including any subsequent outbreak whether or not due to emerging variants thereof, is contained.\nWhile the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted manufacturing, supply chain and clinical trial activities worldwide, including those of our suppliers, vendors and clinical trial sites, these disruptions did not significantly impact our results of operations during 2020 or 2021. The ultimate impact on our operations, however, is unknown and will depend on future developments, such as the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic, among others, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. In particular, global developments concerning COVID-19, including the identification of new strains of coronavirus, and the magnitude of interventions to contain the spread of viruses, such as government-mandated quarantines, shelter-in-place mandates, restrictions on travel, shutdowns for non-essential businesses, requirements regarding social distancing, impact of government-imposed restrictions on the global supply chain, including through use of the Defense Production Act, distribution of vaccines and other public health safety measures, will determine the impact of the pandemic on our business. We are continuing to monitor the latest developments regarding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. However, any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time and may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent Developments\nDuring 2021, we strengthened our leadership team by appointing Dannielle Appelhans as Chief Operating Officer. Ms. Appelhans brings significant experience in building organizations as they evolve from early- to late-stage development, with a particular focus on clinical and commercial manufacturing and scaling supply chains. Additionally, Dr. Laurance Turka has been promoted to chief scientific officer and head of research & translational medicine. Joining Rubius Therapeutics as chief scientific officer in January 2020, Dr. Turka is an internationally recognized physician-scientist in autoimmunity and translational immunology with a distinguished career working in academia and, more recently, in the biotechnology industry where he has built a portfolio of novel therapies targeting immune cells.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval or license or collaboration agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales, payments from collaboration or license agreements that we may enter into with third parties, or any combination thereof.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development and manufacturing of our product candidates, which include:\n \u25cf employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions; \n \u25cf expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates and research programs, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and contract research organizations, or CROs; \n \u25cf the cost of developing and scaling our manufacturing process and manufacturing drug products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including those produced in our manufacturing facility as well as components that are produced under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and any contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, that we may engage; \n \u25cf laboratory supplies and research materials; \n \u25cf facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance; and \n \u25cf payments made under third-party licensing agreements. \nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nOur direct research, manufacturing and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis for clinical candidates. These consist mostly of fees, reimbursed materials, testing and other costs paid to consultants, contractors, CMOs and CROs, as well as the cost of materials incurred for internal manufacturing. In addition, starting in the first quarter of 2020, we allocate the cost of operating our manufacturing facility to research and development program costs, consisting of associated personnel costs, other than stock-based compensation expense, and manufacturing facility costs, including depreciation. We do not allocate costs associated with our platform development, early stage research and shared research and development, including associated personnel costs, laboratory supplies, non-manufacturing facilities expenses and other indirect costs, to research and development programs, because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and our technology platform and, as such, are not separately classified.\nProduct candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially over time in connection with our planned preclinical and clinical development activities in the future. At this time, we cannot accurately estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the following:\n \u25cf the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities; \n \u25cf the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue; \n \u25cf our ability to raise the additional funds necessary to complete preclinical and clinical development of and commercialize our drug candidates; \n \u25cf the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we may enter into collaboration arrangements; \n \u25cf our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones; \n \u25cf our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements; \n \u25cf the successful initiation and completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or any comparable foreign regulatory authority; \n \u25cf the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations; \n \u25cf the receipt and related terms of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u25cf the availability of specialty raw materials for use in production of our product candidates; \n \u25cf our ability to consistently manufacture our product candidates for use in clinical trials; \n \u25cf our ability to operate a manufacturing facility, or secure manufacturing supply through relationships with third parties; \n \u25cf our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally; \n \u25cf our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u25cf the commercialization of our product candidates, if and when approved; \n \u25cf obtaining and maintaining third-party insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement; \n \u25cf the acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; \n \u25cf competition with other products; and \n \u25cf a continued acceptable safety profile of our therapies following approval. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs, as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting and audit services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses may increase in the future as we continue to build infrastructure to support the expansion of our research activities, development of our product candidates and any expanded compliance requirements.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our invested cash balances.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest owed on outstanding borrowings under our Loan Agreement (as defined below), as well as amortization of debt discount.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nObjective\nThe purpose of the following discussion and analysis is to provide material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations from management's perspective, including to describe and explain key trends, events and other factors that impacted our reported results and that are reasonably likely to impact our future performance.\nAs such, the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that is biologically engineering red blood cells or RBCs, to develop an entirely new class of cellular medicines called Red Cell Therapeutics, or RCTs, for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. Based on our vision that human red blood cells are the foundation of the next significant innovation in medicine, we have developed a programmable and highly versatile platform, which we call the RED PLATFORM, to biologically engineer and culture allogeneic cellular therapies that enable multiple applications, or modalities. We believe that the advantage of the platform is that once a modality is validated, as we have demonstrated with our lead product candidate RTX-240 for the treatment of advanced cancers, we increase the likelihood that all the programs within that modality will work, underscoring the broad potential of the RED PLATFORM to help patients.\nIn 2021, we demonstrated strong execution across our pipeline of RCTs. During the year, we presented initial clinical data from our Phase 1 trial with RTX-240 in patients with relapsed refractory solid tumors, which we believe provides clinical validation for our RED platform. Over the course of the year, we advanced enrollment in all our Phase 1studies for RTX-240 in solid tumors and AML, as well as our second program, RTX-321 in patients with HPV 16-positive tumors. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we received IND clearance for our third oncology program, RTX-224, our second broad immune agonist. In January 2022, we began dosing patients in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of RTX-224 for the treatment of patients with certain relapsed/refractory or locally advanced solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer, cutaneous melanoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, urothelial (bladder) carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer.\nAt our Investor Day in December 2021, we shared preclinical proof of concept data, demonstrating tolerance induction and the potential for bystander suppression in two stringent type 1 diabetes preclinical models. These findings are potentially translatable beyond type 1 diabetes to multiple autoimmune diseases, including our priority target indications such as multiple sclerosis and celiac disease.\nIn 2021, we continued to advance our manufacturing capabilities and achieved significant manufacturing milestones, including increased cells produced per batch in 50L bioreactors by four times that of 2020 and providing uninterrupted clinical supply for three Phase 1 arms of the RTX-240 clinical trial and for the Phase 1 RTX-321 trial. We have the potential to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities and plan to stage additional investments based on future needs and in preparation for potential pivotal trial and eventual commercialization.\nHighlights of our clinical product candidates, RTX-240, RTX-321and RTX-224 are described further below.\nBroad Immune Stimulation for the Treatment of Cancer\nRTX-240\nIn March 2021, we announced initial clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of RTX-240 in advanced solid tumors that we believe provides clinical validation of the RED PLATFORM's potential ability to engineer red blood cells to mimic the human immune system and stimulate adaptive and innate immunity to generate clinical responses in cancer patients with refractory disease. RTX-240 is an allogeneic, off-the-shelf cellular therapy product candidate that is engineered to simultaneously present hundreds of thousands of copies of the costimulatory molecule 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) and IL-15TP (trans-presentation of IL-15 on IL-15R\u03b1) in their native forms. RTX-240 is designed to broadly stimulate the immune system by activating and expanding both NK and CD8+ memory T cells to generate a potent anti-tumor response.\nThe data reported in March 2021 included initial safety (n=16) and efficacy (n=15) data from the RTX-240 Phase 1/2 clinical trial in relapsed/refractory or locally advanced solid tumors. These data were also presented at the American Association for Cancer Research Virtual Annual Meeting in April 2021. Five dose cohorts were completed at the time of the data cutoff on February 28, 2021, and the data analysis was based on RECIST v1.1. criteria. We observed the following:\n \u25cf no treatment-related Grade 3 or Grade 4 adverse events or dose limiting toxicities; \n \u25cf most common treatment-related Grade 1/2 adverse events were fatigue, chills, nausea, decreased appetite and arthralgias. There was a single Grade 1 event of liver toxicity; \n \u25cf two responses were observed in the study including a confirmed partial response, or PR, in a patient with metastatic anal cancer, and an unconfirmed PR in a patient with metastatic uveal melanoma. Both patients' diseases had progressed on prior anti PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 therapy, respectively; \n \u25cf stable disease, or SD, was observed in six patients, including four patients with stable disease for at least 12 weeks in non-small cell lung cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer; and \n \u25cf pharmacodynamic effects showed the activation and/or expansion of the key NK and/or T cells types in all patients (n=16). \nFurther, preliminary data from the single agent solid tumor arm of our RTX-240 Phase 1 study that we reported in March 2021 showed early evidence of favorable immune-permissive changes in the tumor microenvironment, or TME, in three out of four patient biopsies, including increased expression of PD-L1 and/or increased ratio of M1/M2 macrophages after treatment with RTX-240, suggesting single-agent RTX-240 is able to induce changes in the TME that have been associated with response to checkpoint inhibition.\nAs a result of no dose-limiting toxicities, or DLTs, and a clear NK cell number dose response and other pharmacodynamic effects, we are continuing to dose escalate the single-agent RTX-240 solid tumor trial and expect to report clinical results for this trial, along with an integrated clinical development plan during the first quarter of 2022.\nIn March 2021, we presented preliminary trafficking data from the first acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, patient in the Phase 1 arm of the ongoing RTX-240 clinical trial for the treatment of relapsed/refractory AML, showing accumulation of activated, granzyme B-positive NK and T cells in the bone marrow, which is the site of disease in AML. We plan to report additional results from this arm of the ongoing RTX-240 clinical trial during the first quarter of 2022.\nIn June 2021, we began dosing patients in the arm of our RTX-240 clinical trial that is evaluating RTX-240 as a combination therapy with pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory or locally advanced solid tumors. We believe that RTX-240, with its mechanism of action as a broad immune agonist, may have synergy with\nimmune checkpoint inhibition and could potentially overcome resistance to PD-1 inhibition. We expect to report initial clinical results from this arm of the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical of RTX-240 during the second half of 2022.\nIn July 2021, the paper entitled Anti-Tumor Effects of RTX-240: An Engineered Red Blood Cell Expressing 4-1BB Ligand and Interleukin-15\u201d was published in the peer-reviewed journal Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy. The publication highlights preclinical findings and demonstrates that, consistent with the data reported in March 2021, RTX-240 activates and expands CD8+ T cells and NK cells in vitro and in vivo generating potent anti-tumor activity in both a colorectal and melanoma model.\nRTX-224\nRTX-224 is an allogeneic cellular therapy that is engineered to express hundreds of thousands of copies of 4-1BBL and interleukin-12, or IL-12, on the cell surface. RTX-224 is designed as a broad immune agonist of both adaptive and innate responses, designed to activate CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, activate and expand NK cells, and promote antigen presentation. It is expected to produce a broad and potent anti-tumor T cell response and an innate immune response and have anti-tumor activity in those tumor types with known sensitivity to T cell killing, including tumor types with high mutational burden, PD-L1 expression and known responsiveness to checkpoint inhibitors. The combination of IL-12 and 4-1BBL has the potential to broadly induce an immune response in patients with solid tumors and may serve as the bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems.\nIn November 2021, we presented preclinical data for RTX-224 at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer's 36th Annual Meeting, showing that RTX-224 activated immune cells in the spleen and blood, leading to their trafficking into the tumor microenvironment to deliver an anti-tumor effect in our preclinical models.\nThe IND for RTX-224 was cleared in 2021, and, in January 2022, we began dosing patients in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of RTX-224 for the treatment of patients with certain relapsed/refractory or locally advanced solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer, cutaneous melanoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, urothelial (bladder) carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer.\nAntigen-Specific Immune Stimulation for the Treatment of Cancer\nRTX-321\nRTX-321 is an allogeneic, off-the-shelf artificial antigen presenting cells, or aAPC, therapy product candidate that is engineered to induce a tumor-specific immune response by expanding antigen-specific T cells. RTX-321 expresses hundreds of thousands of copies of an HPV 16 peptide antigen bound to major histocompatibility complex class I proteins, the costimulatory molecule 4-1BBL and the cytokine IL-12 on the cell surface to mimic human T cell-APC interactions. In our Investigational New Drug, or IND, application filing, we included frozen drug substance for the first\ntime as part of the manufacturing process, allowing for a truly off-the-shelf cellular therapy product candidate with a potential shelf life of several years.\nIn May 2021, a peer-reviewed manuscript about RTX-321 was published in Nature Communications, highlighting preclinical findings demonstrating that the surrogate model of RTX-321 induced a broad immune response, epitope spreading and memory formation in preclinical studies.\nWe began dosing patients in the Phase 1 clinical trial of RTX-321 in April 2021. As of January 2022, there have been no DLTs observed and we are therefore continuing to dose escalate the trial. We expect to report initial results from the trial during the second half of 2022.\nAntigen-Specific Immune Tolerance for the Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases\nRTX-T1D (Type 1 Diabetes)\nIn December 2021, we shared preclinical proof of concept data, demonstrating tolerance induction and the potential for bystander suppression in two stringent type 1 diabetes preclinical models. Specifically, we established efficacy in the BDC2.5 adoptive transfer model with data showing that an RTX-T1D surrogate reversed established inflammation and induced two types of regulatory T cells, resulting in protection against re-challenge. Moreover, the data showed that repeated dosing could extend duration of disease protection to 5 months (the endpoint of the study). We also showed early efficacy in the non-obese diabetic mouse, or NOD, preclinical model. Results at 25 weeks showed that a mouse surrogate of RTX-T1D that delivered only two antigens delayed disease. As disease in NOD mice is caused by many autoantigens, these results demonstrate the potential for bystander suppression. These findings are potentially translatable beyond type 1 diabetes to multiple autoimmune diseases, including other Rubius' high priority target indications such as multiple sclerosis and celiac disease.\nWe intend to present these results in a peer-reviewed setting and expect to provide details of our development timeline later in 2022.\nManufacturing\nUsing our RED PLATFORM, we are utilizing our universal engineering and manufacturing processes to advance a broad pipeline of RCT product candidates into clinical trials in cancer and autoimmune diseases. Common design and manufacturing elements of our RCTs should enable us to achieve significant advantages in product development.\nTo more efficiently develop new RCTs designed to treat different diseases, we have modified one of our initial manufacturing steps in which we add a gene or genes of interest that encode biotherapeutic proteins within the cell or on the cell surface. Using this approach, we have expressed more than 1,000 different therapeutic proteins since platform inception. This programmable process allows for the repeated generation of product candidates and enables us to leverage common CMC and toxicology data packages across our therapies.\nRecognizing the importance of controlling our own manufacturing capabilities to produce consistent and reproducible product at greater scale, we acquired, renovated and operationalized a manufacturing facility in Smithfield, RI, that is currently providing cGMP supply for our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials: RTX-240 in advanced solid tumors, RTX-240 in relapsed/refractory AML, RTX-240 in combination with pembrolizumab, RTX-321 in HPV 16-positive cancers and RTX-224 in advanced solid tumors.\nWe have industrialized the production of RCTs by developing and scaling up a manufacturing process by which hematopoietic progenitor cells are expanded, then biologically engineered and subsequently differentiated into erythroid cells (RCTs) that express biotherapeutic proteins within the cell or on the cell surface. The RED PLATFORM allows us to generate a wide variety of allogeneic, ready-to-use RCT product candidates with a universal and proprietary process.\nIn 2021, we achieved the following manufacturing milestones:\n \u25cf increased cells produced per batch in 50L bioreactors by four times that of 2020, enabling uninterrupted clinical supply for three Phase 1 arms of the RTX-240 clinical trial and for the Phase 1 RTX-321 trial; and \n \u25cf introduced frozen drug substance for RTX-321 and RTX-224, potentially enabling inventory storage for more than two years. \nAdditional accomplishments include:\n \u25cf greater than 90% lot success rate for RTX-240 and RTX-321 clinical supply; \n \u25cf hundreds of doses administered across all three arms of our RTX-240 Phase 1/2 trial and our RTX-321 Phase 1 trial; \n \u25cf high transduction efficiency, with greater than 90% of cells transduced with therapeutic proteins; and \n \u25cf highly consistent protein expression (dual or triple). \nWe have the potential to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities and plan to stage additional investments based on future needs and in preparation for potential pivotal trial and eventual commercialization.\nSince our inception, we have focused substantially all of our resources on building our proprietary RED PLATFORM, establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research and development activities, developing our manufacturing process and manufacturing drug product material, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. To date, we have funded our operations with proceeds from the sale of preferred stock and issuance of debt and with proceeds from our public offerings.\nOn July 20, 2018, we completed our IPO pursuant to which we issued and sold 12,055,450 shares of common stock, inclusive of 1,572,450 shares pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. We received proceeds of $254.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs. In August 2019, we entered into a Distribution Agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Jefferies LLC and SVB Leerink LLC with respect to an at-the-market, or ATM, offering program under which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock, having aggregate gross proceeds of up to $100.0 million. We have not yet sold any shares of our common stock under the ATM offering program. In March 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering, or the March 2021 Offering, pursuant to which we issued and sold 6,896,552 shares of common stock. We received proceeds of $187.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate any product revenue or product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. We reported net losses of $196.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $167.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $677.0 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our expenses and capital requirements will increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if, and as, we:\n \u25cf conduct clinical trials for our product candidates and to the extent we continue to experience delays, setbacks or disruptions to our preclinical studies, clinical trials or clinical supply chain due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; \n \u25cf further develop our RED PLATFORM; \n \u25cf continue to discover and develop additional product candidates; \n \u25cf maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u25cf hire additional clinical, scientific, manufacturing and commercial personnel; \n \u25cf expand in-house manufacturing capabilities, including through the operation and any future renovation or expansion of our manufacturing facility; \n \u25cf establish a commercial manufacturing source and secure supply chain capacity sufficient to provide commercial quantities of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval; \n \u25cf acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; \n \u25cf seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; \n \u25cf establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval; and \n \u25cf add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts, as well as to continue to support the requirements of a public company. \nWe will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing and distribution. Further, we expect to continue to incur costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public and private equity financings, debt financings, borrowings under our credit facility, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution and licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain funding, we plan to implement an operating plan that scales back our operations and focuses our available capital on a reduced number of activities and programs, which we believe will enable the continued advancement of certain of our research and development programs and the preservation of our technology platform. These actions could adversely affect our business prospects.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $225.8 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2023. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nImpact of the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic\nSince March of 2020 and throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented various precautionary measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, partners and prospective clinical trial participants, to comply with applicable national, state and local governmental orders, proclamations and/or directives in effect at any time aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19 and to minimize disruption to our operations. Such measures have included, at\ncertain times, the elimination of business travel, shifting to remote work wherever possible and implementing rotating laboratory work schedules to reduce the number of people onsite at our facilities, advance ordering of certain raw materials impacted by delays in the global supply chain, as well as working with our external partners and clinical sites to utilize virtual clinical trial site training and monitoring, minimizing patient visits and instituting telemedicine to minimize patient exposure. We will continue to use these and other precautionary measures as required until such time as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including any subsequent outbreak whether or not due to emerging variants thereof, is contained.\nWhile the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted manufacturing, supply chain and clinical trial activities worldwide, including those of our suppliers, vendors and clinical trial sites, these disruptions did not significantly impact our results of operations during 2020 or 2021. The ultimate impact on our operations, however, is unknown and will depend on future developments, such as the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic, among others, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. In particular, global developments concerning COVID-19, including the identification of new strains of coronavirus, and the magnitude of interventions to contain the spread of viruses, such as government-mandated quarantines, shelter-in-place mandates, restrictions on travel, shutdowns for non-essential businesses, requirements regarding social distancing, impact of government-imposed restrictions on the global supply chain, including through use of the Defense Production Act, distribution of vaccines and other public health safety measures, will determine the impact of the pandemic on our business. We are continuing to monitor the latest developments regarding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. However, any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time and may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent Developments\nDuring 2021, we strengthened our leadership team by appointing Dannielle Appelhans as Chief Operating Officer. Ms. Appelhans brings significant experience in building organizations as they evolve from early- to late-stage development, with a particular focus on clinical and commercial manufacturing and scaling supply chains. Additionally, Dr. Laurance Turka has been promoted to chief scientific officer and head of research & translational medicine. Joining Rubius Therapeutics as chief scientific officer in January 2020, Dr. Turka is an internationally recognized physician-scientist in autoimmunity and translational immunology with a distinguished career working in academia and, more recently, in the biotechnology industry where he has built a portfolio of novel therapies targeting immune cells.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval or license or collaboration agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales, payments from collaboration or license agreements that we may enter into with third parties, or any combination thereof.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development and manufacturing of our product candidates, which include:\n \u25cf employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions; \n \u25cf expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates and research programs, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and contract research organizations, or CROs; \n \u25cf the cost of developing and scaling our manufacturing process and manufacturing drug products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including those produced in our manufacturing facility as well as components that are produced under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and any contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, that we may engage; \n \u25cf laboratory supplies and research materials; \n \u25cf facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance; and \n \u25cf payments made under third-party licensing agreements. \nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nOur direct research, manufacturing and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis for clinical candidates. These consist mostly of fees, reimbursed materials, testing and other costs paid to consultants, contractors, CMOs and CROs, as well as the cost of materials incurred for internal manufacturing. In addition, starting in the first quarter of 2020, we allocate the cost of operating our manufacturing facility to research and development program costs, consisting of associated personnel costs, other than stock-based compensation expense, and manufacturing facility costs, including depreciation. We do not allocate costs associated with our platform development, early stage research and shared research and development, including associated personnel costs, laboratory supplies, non-manufacturing facilities expenses and other indirect costs, to research and development programs, because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and our technology platform and, as such, are not separately classified.\nProduct candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially over time in connection with our planned preclinical and clinical development activities in the future. At this time, we cannot accurately estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the following:\n \u25cf the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities; \n \u25cf the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue; \n \u25cf our ability to raise the additional funds necessary to complete preclinical and clinical development of and commercialize our drug candidates; \n \u25cf the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we may enter into collaboration arrangements; \n \u25cf our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones; \n \u25cf our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements; \n \u25cf the successful initiation and completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or any comparable foreign regulatory authority; \n \u25cf the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations; \n \u25cf the receipt and related terms of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u25cf the availability of specialty raw materials for use in production of our product candidates; \n \u25cf our ability to consistently manufacture our product candidates for use in clinical trials; \n \u25cf our ability to operate a manufacturing facility, or secure manufacturing supply through relationships with third parties; \n \u25cf our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally; \n \u25cf our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u25cf the commercialization of our product candidates, if and when approved; \n \u25cf obtaining and maintaining third-party insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement; \n \u25cf the acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; \n \u25cf competition with other products; and \n \u25cf a continued acceptable safety profile of our therapies following approval. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs, as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting and audit services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses may increase in the future as we continue to build infrastructure to support the expansion of our research activities, development of our product candidates and any expanded compliance requirements.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our invested cash balances.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest owed on outstanding borrowings under our Loan Agreement (as defined below), as well as amortization of debt discount.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net"}
