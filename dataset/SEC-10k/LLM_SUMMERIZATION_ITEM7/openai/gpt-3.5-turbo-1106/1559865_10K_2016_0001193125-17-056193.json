Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) covers: (i) the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014; and (ii) the financial condition as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. See Note 1 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Company and the basis of presentation of our financial statements. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere herein. This MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements.\nOverview\nEVERTEC is a leading full-service transaction processing business in Latin America, providing a broad range of merchant acquiring, payment processing and business process management services. According to the September 2016 Nilson Report we are one of the largest merchant acquirers in Latin America based on total number of transactions and we believe we are the largest merchant acquirer in the Caribbean and Central America. We serve 18 countries in the region from our base in Puerto Rico. We manage a system of electronic payment networks that process more than two billion transactions annually, and offer a comprehensive suite of services for core bank processing, cash processing and technology outsourcing. In addition, we own and operate the ATH network, one of the leading personal identification number (\u201cPIN\u201d) debit networks in Latin America. We serve a diversified customer base of leading financial institutions, merchants, corporations and government agencies with \u201cmission-critical\u201d technology solutions that enable them to issue, process and accept transactions securely. We believe our business is well-positioned to continue to expand across the fast-growing Latin American region.\nWe are differentiated, in part, by our diversified business model, which enables us to provide our varied customer base with a broad range of transaction-processing services from a single source across numerous channels and geographic markets. We believe this single-source capability provides several competitive advantages that will enable us to continue to penetrate our existing customer base with complementary new services, win new customers, develop new sales channels and enter new markets. We believe these competitive advantages include:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Our ability to provide in one package a range of services that traditionally had to be sourced from different vendors; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Our ability to serve customers with disparate operations in several geographies with a single integrated technology solution that enables them to manage their business as one enterprise; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Our ability to capture and analyze data across the transaction processing value chain and use that data to provide value-added services that are differentiated from those offered by pure-play vendors that serve only one portion of the transaction processing value chain (such as only merchant acquiring or payment processing). </td> </tr>\n</table> Our broad suite of services spans the transaction processing value chain and includes a range of front-end customer-facing solutions such as the electronic capture and authorization of transactions at the point-of-sale, as well as back-end support services such as the clearing and settlement of transactions and account reconciliation for card issuers. These include: (i) merchant acquiring services, which enable point of sales (\u201cPOS\u201d) and e-commerce merchants to accept and process electronic methods of payment such as debit, credit, prepaid and electronic benefit transfer (\u201cEBT\u201d) cards; (ii) payment processing services, which enable financial institutions and other issuers to manage, support and facilitate the processing for credit, debit, prepaid, automated teller machines (\u201cATM\u201d) and EBT card programs; and (iii) business process management solutions, which provide \u201cmission-critical\u201d technology solutions such as core bank processing, as well as IT outsourcing and cash management services to financial institutions, corporations and governments. We provide these services through a highly scalable, end-to-end technology platform that we manage and operate in-house and that generates significant operating efficiencies that enable us to maximize profitability.\nWe sell and distribute our services primarily through a proprietary direct sales force with established customer relationships. We are also building a variety of indirect sales channels that enable us to leverage the distribution capabilities of partners in adjacent markets, including value-added resellers. We continue to pursue joint ventures and merchant acquiring alliances.\nWe benefit from an attractive business model, the hallmarks of which are recurring revenue, scalability, significant operating margins and low capital expenditure requirements. Our revenue is predominantly recurring in nature because of the mission-critical and embedded nature of the services we provide. In addition, we generally negotiate multi-year contracts with our customers. Our business model enables us to continue to grow our business organically without significant incremental capital expenditures.\nSeparation from and Key Relationship with Popular\nPrior to the Merger on September 30, 2010, EVERTEC Group was 100% owned by Popular, the largest financial institution in the Caribbean, and operated substantially as an independent entity within Popular. After the consummation of the Merger, Popular retained an approximately 49% indirect ownership interest in EVERTEC Group and is our largest customer. In connection with, and upon consummation of, the Merger, EVERTEC Group entered into a 15-year Master Services Agreement, and several related agreements with Popular. Under the terms of the Master Services Agreement, Popular agreed to continue to use EVERTEC services on an ongoing exclusive basis, for the duration of the agreement, on commercial terms consistent with those of our historical relationship. Additionally, Popular granted us a right of first refusal on the development of certain new financial technology products and services for the duration of the Master Services Agreement. As of December 31, 2016, Popular retained a 16.05% interest in EVERTEC.\n2016 Developments\nThe Company's Board of Directors approved regular quarterly dividends of $0.10 per common share in February, May, July and October of 2016.\nOn March 1, 2016, the Company completed the purchase of 65% of the share capital of Processa SAS.\nOn November 4, 2016, EVERTEC Group, together with certain other direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, entered into a third amendment to the Credit Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2013. Among other things, the amendment to the Credit Agreement extends the maturity of (a) approximately $219 million of the Borrower's existing approximately $250 million of term loan A facility to January 17, 2020 and (b) $65 million of the Borrower's existing $100 million of revolving credit facility to January 17, 2020. The remaining approximately $30 million of term loan A facility and the $35 million of revolving credit facility that were not extended will remain in place and mature as originally scheduled on April 17, 2018.\nOn December 14, 2016, the Company completed the purchase of certain assets, including the customer relationship, of Accuprint, Inc., a data management and printing services company in Puerto Rico.\nFactors and Trends Affecting the Results of Our Operations\nThe ongoing migration from cash and paper methods of payment to electronic payments continues to benefit the transaction- processing industry globally. We believe that the penetration of electronic payments in the markets in which we operate is significantly lower relative to the U.S. market, and that this ongoing shift will continue to generate substantial growth opportunities for our business. For example, currently the adoption of banking products, including electronic payments, in the Latin American and Caribbean region is lower relative to the mature U.S. and European markets. We believe that the unbanked and underbanked population in our markets will continue to shrink, and therefore drive incremental penetration and growth of electronic payments in Puerto Rico and other Latin American regions. We also benefit from the trend for financial institutions and government\nagencies to outsource technology systems and processes. Many medium- and small-size institutions in the Latin American markets in which we operate have outdated computer systems and updating these IT legacy systems is financially and logistically challenging, which presents a business opportunity for us.\nFinally, our financial condition and results of operations are, in part, dependent on the economic and general conditions of the geographies in which we operate.\nThe Puerto Rico government is experiencing a debt crisis and has defaulted on several of its debt payments, stating that it is unable to both service its debt and continue to provide essential services to its citizens. An emergency moratorium on debt payments was implemented by the Puerto Rico government to ensure continuity of essential services to Puerto Rico citizens. The Puerto Rican government is a large customer of ours and many Puerto Rican businesses and if it is unable to pay its obligations as they become due or at all, this will likely have an adverse impact on the island's economy.\nOn June 30, 2016, the U.S. President signed into law PROMESA. PROMESA establishes a fiscal oversight and the Oversight Board comprised of seven voting members appointed by the President. The Oversight Board has broad budgetary and financial powers over Puerto Rico's budget, laws, financial plans and regulations, including the power to approve restructuring agreements with creditors, file petitions for restructuring and reform the electronic system for the tax collection. The Oversight Board will have ultimate authority in preparing the Puerto Rico government's budget and any issuance of future debt by the government and its instrumentalities. In addition, PROMESA imposes an automatic stay on all litigation against Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities, as well as any other judicial or administrative actions or proceedings to enforce or collect claims against the Puerto Rico government. This stay is currently in effect up to May 2017 and can be extended by the Oversight Board or U.S. District Court of Puerto Rico.\nAs the solution to the Puerto Rican government's debt crisis remains unclear, we continue to carefully monitor our receivables with the government as well as monitor general economic trends to understand the impact the crisis has on the economy of Puerto Rico and our card payment volumes. To date our receivables with the Puerto Rican government and overall payment transaction volumes have not been significantly affected by the debt crisis, however we remain cautious.\nWe are also concerned that the crisis could further accelerate the ongoing emigration trend of Puerto Rico residents to the United States, which has a negative impact on the island's economy and our business.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, and in some instances, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period.\nWe base our assumptions, estimates, and judgments on historical experience, current events and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. However, because future events are inherently uncertain and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. A summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical; require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments; and thus result in estimates that are inherently uncertain.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company's revenue recognition policy follows the guidance from Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 605 Revenue Recognition; ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple Element Arrangements; and; ASC 985, Software, which provide guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when the following four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, (ii) delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the selling price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. For multiple deliverable arrangements, EVERTEC evaluates each arrangement to determine if the elements or deliverables within the arrangement represent separate units of accounting pursuant to ASC 605-25. If the deliverables are determined to be separate units of accounting, revenues are recognized as units of accounting are delivered and the revenue recognition criteria are met. If the deliverables are not determined to be separate units of accounting, revenues for the delivered services are combined into one unit of accounting and recognized (i) over the life of the arrangement if all services are consistently delivered over such term, or if otherwise, (ii) at the time that all services and deliverables have been delivered. The selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence (\u201cVSOE\u201d) if available, third party evidence (\u201cTPE\u201d) if VSOE is not available, or Management's best estimate of selling price (\u201cBESP\u201d) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. EVERTEC establishes VSOE of selling price using the price charged when the same element is sold separately. EVERTEC bifurcates or allocates the arrangement consideration to each of the deliverables based on the relative selling price of each unit of accounting.\nThe Company has two main categories of revenues according to the type of transactions EVERTEC enters into with the Company's customers: (a) transaction-based fees and (b) fixed fees and time and material.\nTransaction-based fees\nThe Company provides services that generate transaction-based fees. Typically transaction-based fees depend on factors such as number of accounts or transactions processed. These factors typically consist of a fee per transaction or item processed, a percentage of dollar volume processed or a fee per account on file, or some combination thereof. Revenue derived from the transaction-based fee contracts are recognized when the underlying transaction is processed, which constitutes delivery of service.\nRevenues from business contracts in the Company's Merchant Acquiring segment are primarily comprised of discount fees charged to the merchants based on the sales amount of transactions processed. Revenues include a discount fee and membership fees charged to merchants and debit network fees as well as point-of-sale (\u201cPOS\u201d) rental fees. Pursuant to the guidance from ASC 605-45-45, Revenue Recognition-Principal Agent Considerations, EVERTEC records Merchant Acquiring revenues net of interchange and assessments charged by the credit and debit card network associations and recognizes such revenues at the time of the sale (when a transaction is processed).\nPayment processing revenues are comprised of revenues related to providing access to the ATH network and other card networks to financial institutions, and related services. Payment processing revenues also include revenues from card issuer processing services (such as credit and debit card processing, authorization and settlement, and fraud monitoring and control to debit or credit card issuers), payment processing services (such as payment and billing products for merchants, businesses and financial institutions) and EBT (which principally consists of services to the Puerto Rico government for the delivery of government benefits to participants). Revenues in EVERTEC's Payment Processing segment are primarily comprised of fees per transaction processed or per account on file, or a combination of both, and are recognized at the time transactions are processed or on a monthly basis for accounts on file.\nTransaction-based fees within EVERTEC's Business Solutions segment consist of revenues from business process management solutions including core bank processing, business process outsourcing, item and cash processing, and fulfillment. Transaction-based fee revenues generated by the Company's core bank processing services are derived from fees based on various factors such as the number of accounts on file (e.g. savings or checking accounts, loans, etc.), and the number of transactions processed or registered users (e.g. for online banking services). For services dependent on the number of transactions processed, revenues are recognized as the underlying transactions are processed. For services dependent on the number of users or accounts on file, revenues are recognized on a monthly basis based on the number of accounts on file each month. Item and cash processing revenues are based upon the number of items (e.g. checks) processed and revenues are recognized when the underlying item is processed. Fulfillment services include technical and operational resources for producing and distributing variable print documents such as statements, bills, checks and benefits summaries. Fulfillment revenues are based upon the number pages for printing services and the number of envelopes processed for mailing services. Revenues are recognized as services are delivered based on a fee per page printed or envelope mailed, as applicable.\nFixed fees and time and material\nThe Company also provides services that generate a fixed fee per month or fees based on time and expenses incurred. These services are mostly provided in EVERTEC's Business Solutions segment. Revenues are generated from EVERTEC's core bank solutions, network hosting and management and IT consulting services.\nIn core bank solutions, the Company mostly provides access to applications and services such as back-up or recovery, hosting and maintenance that enable a bank to operate the related hosted services accessing the Company's IT infrastructure. These contracts generally contain multiple elements or deliverables which are evaluated by EVERTEC and revenues are recognized according to the applicable guidance. Revenue is derived from fixed fees charged for the use of hosted services and are recognized on a monthly basis as delivered. Set-up fees are billed to the customer when the service is rendered; however, they are deferred and recognized as revenues over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of the customer relationship, whichever is longer, as set-up services rarely provide value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and are interrelated with the service to be provided under the contract.\nIn network hosting and management, EVERTEC provides hosting services for network infrastructure at EVETEC's facilities; automated monitoring services; maintenance of call centers; interactive voice response solutions, among other related services. Revenues are primarily derived from monthly fees as services are delivered. Set-up fees are billed up-front to the customer when the set-up service is rendered; however, they are deferred and recognized as revenues over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of the customer relationship, whichever is longer, as set-up services rarely provide value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and are interrelated with the service under the contract. There are some arrangements under this line of service category that may contain undelivered elements. In such cases, the undelivered elements are evaluated and recognized when the services are delivered or at the time that all deliverables under the contract have been delivered.\nIT consulting services revenue primarily consists of time billings based upon the number of hours dedicated to each client. Revenue from time billings are recognized as services are delivered.\nEVERTEC also charges members of the ATH network an annual membership fee; however, these fees are deferred and recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over the year and recorded in the Company's Payment Processing segment. In addition, occasionally EVERTEC is a reseller of hardware and software products and revenues from these resale transactions are recognized when such product is delivered and accepted by the client.\nService level arrangements\nThe Company's service contracts may include service level arrangements (\u201cSLA\u201d) generally allowing the customer to receive a credit for part of the service fee when the Company has not provided the agreed level of services. The SLA performance obligation is committed on a monthly basis, thus SLA performance is monitored and assessed for compliance with arrangements on a monthly basis, including determination and accounting for its economic impact, if any.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment.\nFor 2016, the Company used a \u201cqualitative assessment\u201d option or \u201cstep zero\u201d for the goodwill impairment test for all of its reporting units. With this process, the Company first assesses whether it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the answer is no, then the fair value of the reporting unit does not need to be measured, and step one and step two, as explained below, are bypassed. In assessing the fair value of a reporting unit, which is based on the nature of the business and reporting unit's current and expected financial performance, the Company uses a combination of factors such as industry and market conditions, overall financial performance and the entity and reporting unit specific events.\nIn the past, the goodwill impairment test used was a two-step process at each reporting unit level. The first step used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis is required. The second step consists of comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, no impairment losses associated with goodwill were recognized.\nOther identifiable intangible assets with a definitive useful life are amortized using the straight-line method or an accelerated method. These intangibles are evaluated periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nOther identifiable intangible assets with a definitive useful life include a customer relationship, trademark, software packages and a non-compete agreement acquired during September 2010 when Apollo acquired a 51% indirect ownership interest in EVERTEC as part of a merger (the \u201cMerger\u201d); a customer relationship asset acquired in 2015 from a local bank in Puerto Rico, and customer relationship assets acquired as part of business combination transactions in 2016.\nThe customer relationship assets were valued using the excess earnings method under the income approach. Trademark assets were valued using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. Software packages, which include capitalized software development costs, were recorded at cost. The non-compete agreement was valued based on the estimated impact that theoretical competition would have on revenues and expenses.\nIncome Tax\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. A temporary difference refers to a difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability, determined based on recognition and measurement requirements for\ntax positions, and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future effects on income taxes that result from temporary differences and carryforwards that exist at the end of a period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and provisions of the enacted tax law and are not discounted to reflect the time-value of money. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income in the period that includes the enactment date. A deferred tax valuation allowance is established if it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nThe Company recognizes the benefit of uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement or disposition of the underlying issue with the taxing authority. Accordingly, the amount of benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements may differ from the amount taken or expected to be taken in the tax return resulting in unrecognized tax benefits (\u201cUTBs\u201d). The Company recognizes the interest and penalties associated with UTBs as part of the provision for income taxes on its consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Accrued interest and penalties are included on the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAll companies within EVERTEC are legal entities which file separate income tax returns.\nShare-based Compensation\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock-based awards, on a contemporaneous basis, at the date they are granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model for Tranche A options and the Monte Carlo simulation analysis for Tranche B and Tranche C options and market based restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) using the following assumptions: (1) stock price; (2) risk-free rate; (3) expected volatility; (4) expected annual dividend yield and (5) expected term. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Constant Maturities Treasury Interest Rate as of the grant date or the yield of a 2-year or 3-year Treasury bond, as applicable. The expected volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility and implied volatility from publicly traded companies in the Company's industry. The expected annual dividend yield is based on management's expectations of future dividends as of the grant date and, in certain cases, assumes that those dividends will be reinvested over the performance period. The expected term for stock options granted under the 2010 Plan was based on the vesting time of the options. For the stock options granted under the 2013 Plan, the simplified method was used to estimate the expected term, given that the Company did not have appropriate exercise data on which to base the estimate nor is exercise data relating to employees of comparable companies easily obtainable. Performance and time based RSUs and restricted stock are valued based on the market price of the Company's stock at the grant date.\nUpon option exercise or restricted stock or RSUs release, participants may elect to \u201cnet share settle\u201d. Rather than requiring the participant to deliver cash to satisfy the exercise price, for options exercise, and statutory minimum tax withholdings, the Company withholds a sufficient number of shares to cover these amounts and delivers the net shares to the participant. The Company recognizes the associated tax withholding obligation as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.\nAs compensation expense is recognized, a deferred tax asset is established. At the time stock options are exercised, restricted stock or RSUs are released, a current tax deduction arises based on the value at the time of exercise or release. This deduction may exceed the associated deferred tax asset, resulting in a \u201cwindfall tax benefit\u201d. The windfall is recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as an increase to additional paid-in capital, and is included in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing inflow.\nIn determining the amount of cash tax savings realized from the excess share-based compensation deductions, the Company follows the tax law ordering approach. Under this approach, the utilization of excess tax deductions\nassociated with share-based awards is dictated by provision in the tax law that identify the sequence in which such benefits are utilized for tax purposes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of recent accounting standards, see Note 2 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per common share, as presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. They are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to total revenues, net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as measures of our liquidity.\nFor more information regarding EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per common share, including a quantitative reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per common share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial performance measure, which is net income, see \u201c-Net Income Reconciliation to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per common share\u201d and \u201c-Covenant Compliance\u201d below.\nOverview of Results of Operations\nThe following briefly describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Descriptions of the revenue recognition policies are detailed in Note 1 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMerchant Acquiring, net. Merchant Acquiring revenue consists of income from services that allow merchants to accept electronic methods of payment. Our standard merchant contract has an initial term of one or three years, with automatic one-year renewal periods. In the Merchant Acquiring segment, sources of revenue include a discount fee (generally a percentage of the sales amount of a credit or debit card transaction value) and membership fees charged to merchants, debit network fees and rental income from POS devices and other equipment, net of credit card interchange and assessment fees charged by credit card associations (such as VISA or MasterCard) or payment networks.\nPayment Processing. Payment Processing revenue comprises income related to providing financial institutions access to the ATH network and other card networks, including related services such as authorization, processing, management and recording of ATM and POS transactions, and ATM management and monitoring. Payment Processing revenue also includes income from card processing services for debit or credit issuers, such as credit and debit card processing, authorization and settlement and fraud monitoring and control services; payment processing services such as payment and billing products for merchants, businesses and financial institutions; and EBT, which principally consists of services to the Puerto Rico government for the delivery of government benefits to participants. Payment products include electronic check processing, automated clearing house (\u201cACH\u201d), lockbox, interactive voice response and web-based payments through personalized websites, among others.\nWe generally enter into one to five year contracts with our private payment processing clients and one year contracts with our government payment processing clients. For ATH network and processing services, revenue is driven mainly by the number of transactions processed. Revenue is derived mainly from network fees, transaction switching and processing fees, and leasing of POS devices. For card issuer processing, revenue is dependent mostly upon the number of cardholder accounts on file, transactions and authorizations processed, the\nnumber of cards embossed and other processing services. For EBT services, revenue is derived mainly from the number of beneficiaries on file.\nBusiness Solutions. Business Solutions revenue consists of income from a full suite of business process management solutions including core bank processing, network hosting and management, IT consulting services, business process outsourcing, item and cash processing, and fulfillment. We generally enter into one to five year contracts with our private and government Business Solutions clients.\nIn addition, we are a reseller of hardware and software products; these resale transactions are generally one-time transactions. Revenue from sales of hardware or software products is recognized once the following four criteria are met: (i) evidence of an agreement exists, (ii) delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the selling price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collection of the selling price is reasonably assured or probable, as applicable.\nCost of revenues. This caption includes the costs directly associated with providing services to customers, as well as, product and software sales, including software licensing and maintenance costs; telecommunications costs; personnel and infrastructure costs to develop and maintain applications, operate computer networks and provide associated customer support; and other operating expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative. This caption consists mainly of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management, advertising and promotional costs, audit and legal fees, and other selling expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization. This caption consists of our depreciation and amortization expense. Following the completion of the Merger, our depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of the purchase price allocation adjustments to reflect the fair market value and revised useful life assigned to property and equipment and intangible assets in connection with the Merger.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth certain consolidated financial information for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. These tables and the related discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and\nThe following tables present the components of our audited consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income by business segment and the change in those amounts for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nRevenues\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollar amounts in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Merchant Acquiring, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Payment Processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111,507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business Solutions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>186,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>389,507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>373,528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Total revenues increased by $16.0 million to $389.5 million when compared with 2015.\nMerchant Acquiring revenue increased $5.8 million or 7% when compared with the prior year. The revenue growth was driven by the addition of the FirstBank of Puerto Rico (\u201cFirstBank\u201d) merchant portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2015, partially offset by a contract change for a merchant acquiring customer to payment processing, lower average ticket as well as other merchant mix shifts.\nPayment Processing revenue increased by $3.2 million or 3% primarily driven by an increase in transactions processed over the ATH\u00ae debit network and revenue related to the Processa acquisition. These increases were partially offset by a reduction related to the shift in revenue from FirstBank from payment processing to merchant acquiring in 2016, as well as a decrease in revenues due to a delayed project amounting to approximately $4.5 million and lower revenues from the government lottery tax contract terminated in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nBusiness Solutions revenue increased approximately $7.0 million or 4% when compared with 2015. The increase is primarily driven by revenues from core banking activities related to an increase in volume and new services provided. In addition, revenues grew modestly in network services, business process outsourcing and IT Consulting. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from cash and item processing services.\nOperating costs and expenses\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollar amounts in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>175,809 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>167,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,893 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,567 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,974 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,407 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating costs and expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>282,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>270,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Operating costs and expenses increased by $12.2 million or 5% to $282.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily driven by a $17.6 million increase in cost of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $5.4 million in depreciation and amortization.\nCost of revenues increased 5% to $175.8 million and was primarily driven by a $4.9 million increase in expenses for revenue sharing referral agreements with certain banks in Puerto Rico and increases in equipment expenses, professional fees and other operating taxes. These increases were partially offset by a $4.5 million decrease in compensation expense as the prior year period includes severance payments as part of voluntary termination offers extended to certain employees which included special termination benefits.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $9.7 million primarily driven by a $4.5 million increase in salaries and benefits including higher share based compensation, coupled with a $3.0 million increase in professional fees mostly due to costs incurred in connection with the restatement.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $5.4 million or 8% compared with 2015. The decrease resulted from lower amortization of software packages primarily related to software acquired as part of the Merger that became fully amortized during the third quarter of 2015.\nIncome from operations\nThe following table presents income from operations by reportable segments.\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollar amounts in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment income from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Merchant Acquiring, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,415 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-15 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Payment Processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,071 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55,429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,358 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business Solutions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment income from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>139,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142,095 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,179 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Merger related depreciation and amortization and other unallocated expenses (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32,771 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38,735 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-15 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>107,145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>103,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>Primarily represents non-operating depreciation and amortization expenses generated as a result of the Merger and certain non-recurring fees and expenses. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome from operations increased $3.8 million or 4% compared with 2015. The increase was primarily driven by Business Solutions as revenues in the segment increased year over year while maintaining operating expenses relatively stable and reducing depreciation and amortization expenses. In addition, Merger related depreciation and amortization decreased as some assets were fully amortized towards the end of the prior year. These positive variances were partially offset by a decrease in income from operations in our Merchant Acquiring segments as a result of the aforementioned contract change for a merchant acquiring customer to payment processing coupled with revenues at lower margins from FirstBank. The FirstBank relationship also resulted in increased amortization expense from the customer relationship intangible asset recognized as part of the acquisition. In addition, we experience reduced margin contribution due to increased transactions at a lower ticket price and merchant mix shifts that reduced net revenue. The Payment Processing segment was impacted by the aforementioned project delay which decreased revenues by approximately $4.5 million coupled with an increase in depreciation and amortization expense.\nSee Note 22 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the Company's reportable segments and for a reconciliation of income from operations to net income.\nNon-operating expenses\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollar amounts in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-operating income (expenses)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>377 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(118 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-24 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,617 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,266 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(351 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Losses) earnings of equity method investment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(199 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-135 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>544 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,762 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-76 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(23,748 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,318 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,430 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Total non-operating expenses increased $2.4 million when compared with the prior year. The increase is driven by the $1.5 million loss on extinguishment recorded as part of the debt refinancing transaction completed in the fourth quarter of 2016, which is included in Other income, net, coupled with a $0.4 million increase in interest\nexpense and a $0.2 million decrease in earnings from our equity method investment in the Dominican Republic, Consorcio de Tarjetas Dominicanas, S.A. (\u201cCONTADO\u201d).\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\nIncome tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to approximately $8.3 million compared with an income tax benefit of $3.3 million in 2015. The effective tax rate in 2016 was approximately 10%. The prior year tax benefit reflects the reversal of tax liability related to an uncertain tax position for which the statute of limitations expired during the third quarter of 2015.\nSee Note 18 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding income taxes.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following tables present the components of our audited consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income by business segment and the change in those amounts for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nRevenues\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollar amounts in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Merchant Acquiring, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79,136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Payment Processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,607 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business Solutions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177,939 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>373,528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>361,788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Total revenues increased by $11.7 million to $373.5 million when compared with 2014.\nMerchant Acquiring revenue increased $6.3 million or 8% when compared with the prior year. The revenue growth was primarily related to an increase in sales volumes for existing merchants coupled with the addition of the FirstBank of Puerto Rico (\u201cFirstBank\u201d) merchant portfolio and an overall improvement in spread.\nPayment Processing revenue increased by $3.6 million or 3%. Revenue growth was driven mainly by an increase in ATH and POS network and processing transactions, partially offset by reduced revenues from contracts with the Puerto Rico government.\nBusiness Solutions revenue increased $1.9 million or 1% when compared with 2014. The increase is primarily driven by an increase in revenues from core banking activities, partially offset by a decrease in IT Consulting and IT Management services.\nOperating costs and expenses\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollar amounts in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>167,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>157,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,276 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,998 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-10 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,974 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,014 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating costs and expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>270,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>264,801 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating costs and expenses increased by $5.4 million or 2% to $270.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily driven by a $10.4 million increase in cost of revenues, partially offset by a decrease of $4.0 million and $1.0 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization, respectively.\nCost of revenues increased 7% when compared with 2014. The increase was primarily driven by a $7.4 million increase in salaries and other benefits as a result of severance payments primarily related to the voluntary termination offers extended to certain employees during 2015 coupled with an increase in share based compensation. Other operating expenses increased by $2.3 million primarily driven by an increase in bad debt expense and operational losses in addition to expenses recorded as a result of the revenue sharing agreement entered into with FirstBank in connection with the purchase of the merchant portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, professional fees increased by $1.2 million as a result of an increase in project development costs related to a card issuing platform initiative.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased 10% when compared with the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by non-recurring expenses recorded in 2014 amounting to $7.9 million associated to the CEO succession and acceleration of vesting of certain stock options, and a $1.1 million decrease in professional expenses related to the debt offering that was withdrawn. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in salaries related to higher share based compensation and the impact of severance payments made related to the aforementioned voluntary termination offers.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by 2% compared with 2014. The decrease resulted from lower amortization of software packages.\nIncome from operations\nThe following table presents income from operations by reportable segments.\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollar amounts in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment income from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Merchant Acquiring, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Payment Processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55,429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,367 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business Solutions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,299 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment income from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142,095 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Merger related depreciation and amortization and other unallocated expenses (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38,735 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(44,470 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>103,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>Primarily represents non-operating depreciation and amortization expenses generated as a result of the Merger and certain non-recurring fees and expenses. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome from operations increased $6.4 million or 7% compared with 2014. The increase in income from operations was primarily driven by an increase in income from Merchant Acquiring and Business Solutions, coupled with a decrease in Merger related depreciation and amortization and other unallocated expenses, partially offset by a decrease in income from Payment Processing. Merchant Acquiring income increased by $2.1 million, primarily driven by an increase in sales volume and spread coupled with increased business from the FirstBank merchant portfolio purchased during the fourth quarter of 2015. Business Solutions income increased by $1.9 million as a result of an increase in Core Banking revenues primarily from the Doral Bank consolidation as well as new projects with Popular. Payment Processing income decreased by $3.4 million as a\nresult of certain repricings that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2014 and reduced revenues from contracts with the Puerto Rico government.\nSee Note 22 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the Company's reportable segments and for a reconciliation of income from operations to net income.\nNon-operating expenses\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollar amounts in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-operating income (expenses)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,266 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,772 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,506 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings of equity method investment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(993 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-87 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expenses)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(69 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,318 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,929 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>611 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Total non-operating expenses decreased $0.6 million when compared with the prior year. The decrease is primarily driven by a $1.5 million decrease in interest expense mainly as a result of a decrease of 25 basis points in the interest rate as a result of the senior secured leverage ratio decreasing below 3.50x coupled with a lower outstanding loan balance. The decrease was partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in earnings from our equity method investment in the Dominican Republic, CONTADO.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015 amounted to approximately $3.3 million compared with an income tax expense of $8.9 million in 2014. The $12.6 million increase in tax benefit is primarily driven by the reversal of liabilities related to an uncertain tax position for which the statute of limitations expired during the third quarter of 2015.\nSee Note 18 of the Notes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding income taxes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nOur principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operations and our primary liquidity requirements are the funding of capital expenditures, principal debt repayments and working capital needs. We also have a $100.0 million revolving credit facility, of which $72 million was available as of December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had cash of $51.9 million, of which $35.5 million resides in our subsidiaries located outside of Puerto Rico for purposes of (i) funding the respective subsidiary's current business operations and (ii) funding potential future investment outside of Puerto Rico. We intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of Puerto Rico, and based on our liquidity forecast, we will not need to repatriate this cash to fund our Puerto Rico operations or to meet debt-service obligations. However, if in the future we determine that we no longer need to maintain such cash balances within our foreign subsidiaries, we may elect to distribute such cash to the Company in Puerto Rico. Distributions from the foreign subsidiaries to Puerto Rico are likely subject to tax withholding and other tax consequences.\nOur primary use of cash is for operating expenses, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, dividend payments, share repurchases, debt service, acquisitions and other transactions as opportunities present themselves.\nBased on our current level of operations, we believe our cash flows from operations and the available senior secured revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months. However, our ability to fund future operating expenses, dividend payments, capital expenditures, mergers and acquisitions, and our ability to make scheduled payments of interest, to pay principal on or refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy any other of our present or future debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial and other factors beyond our control.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nThe following table presents our cash flows from operations, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollar amounts in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>168,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>162,419 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(54,083 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53,068 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(90,798 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(112,718 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase (decrease) in cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,367 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $168.1 million, an increase of $5.6 million compared with 2015. The increase was driven by less cash used to pay accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in unearned income.\nNet cash used in investing activities amounted to $54.1 million, primarily driven by additions to software amounting to $23.8 million, acquisitions of property and equipment of $18.5 million and the completion of the Processa and the Accuprint purchase transactions for $15.6 million in cash.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to $90.8 million, a decrease of $21.9 million when compared with the prior year. The decrease is driven by less cash used in the repurchase of common stock, coupled with an increase in cash provided by short-term borrowings partially offset by cash paid during the year for amendments made to the Company's debt agreement, credit amendment fees of $3.6 million and debt issue costs of $4.8 million.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following table presents our cash flows from operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollar amounts in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>162,419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139,819 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53,068 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,831 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(112,718 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(104,149 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Decrease) increase in cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,367 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,839 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $162.4 million, an increase of $22.6 million compared with 2014. The increase was driven by higher income from operations in 2015, coupled with less cash used to pay accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $27.2 million, primarily driven by the FirstBank merchant portfolio transaction in which the Company purchased the FirstBank merchant portfolio and certain POS machines for $11.5 million. In addition, restricted cash increased by $6.1 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 amounted to $112.7 million, an increase of $8.6 million when compared with the prior year. The increase is driven by more cash used in the repurchase of common stock, partially offset by less cash used to pay down short term borrowings during the year.\nCapital Resources\nOur principal capital expenditures are for hardware and computer software (purchased and internally developed), additions to property and equipment and business combination transactions, including the purchase of Processa and Accuprint during 2016 for $15.6 million. In connection with the Accuprint acquisition, we have recorded a $1.1 million contingent liability to be settled in two years. We invested approximately $57.9 million, $47.0 million, and $25.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash flow from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nDividend Payments\nWe currently have a policy under which we pay a regular quarterly dividend on our common stock, subject to the declaration thereof each quarter by our Board. Refer to the table below for details regarding our dividends in 2016 and 2015:\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Declaration Date\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Record Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Dividend\nper share </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> February 18, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>March 2, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>March 19, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> May 6, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>May 18, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 5, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> August 5, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>August 17, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 3, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> November 4, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>November 16, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 4, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> February 17, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>February 29, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>March 17, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> May 11, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>May 23, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 10, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> July 28, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>August 9, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 2, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 27, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>November 14, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 2, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Stock Repurchase\nDuring 2016, the Company repurchased 2,504,427 shares of the Company's common stock at a cost of $39.9 million. The Company funded such repurchase with cash on hand and borrowings under the existing revolving credit facility.\nDuring 2015, the Company repurchased 3,012,826 shares of the Company's common stock at a cost of $54.9 million. The Company funded such repurchase with cash on hand and borrowings under the existing revolving credit facility.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company repurchased 1,201,194 shares of the Company's common stock at a cost of $26.2 million. The Company funded such repurchase with cash on hand and borrowings under the existing revolving credit facility.\nRepurchases may be accomplished through open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs and other means.\nFinancial Obligations\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities\nOn April 17, 2013, EVERTEC Group entered into a credit agreement (the \u201c2013 Credit Agreement\u201d) governing the senior secured credit facilities, consisting of a $300.0 million term loan A facility (the \u201cTerm A Loan\u201d), a $400.0 million term loan B facility (the \u201cTerm B Loan\u201d) and a $100.0 million revolving credit facility.\nTerm A Loan\nThe Term A Loan requires principal payments on the last business day of each quarter equal to (a) 1.250% of the original principal amount commencing on September 30, 2013 through June 30, 2016; (b) 1.875% of the original principal amount from September 30, 2016 through June 30, 2017; (c) 2.50% of the original principal amount from September 30, 2017 through March 31, 2018; and (d) the remaining outstanding principal amount on the maturity of the Term A Loan on April 17, 2018. Interest is based on EVERTEC Group LLC's (\u201cEVERTEC Group\u201d) first lien secured net leverage ratio and payable at a rate equal to, at the Company's option, either (a) LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.00% to 2.50%, or (b) Alternate Base Rate (\u201cABR\u201d), as defined in the 2013 Credit Agreement, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.50%. The Term A Loan has no LIBOR or Base Rate minimum or floor.\nTerm B Loan\nThe Term B Loan requires principal payments on the last business day of each quarter equal to 0.250% of the original principal amount commencing on September 30, 2013 and the remaining outstanding principal amount on the maturity of the Term B Loan on April 17, 2020. Interest is based on EVERTEC Group's first lien secured net leverage ratio and payable at a rate equal to, at the Company's option, either (a) LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.50% to 2.75%, or (b) Base Rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.50% to 1.75%. The LIBOR Rate and Base Rate are subject to floors of 0.75% and 1.75%, respectively.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nThe revolving credit facility has an available balance up to $100.0 million, with an interest rate on loans calculated the same as the applicable Term A Loan rate. The facility matures on April 17, 2018 and has a \u201ccommitment fee\u201d payable one business day after the last business day of each quarter calculated based on the daily unused commitment during the preceding quarter. The commitment fee for the unused portion of this facility ranges from 0.125% to 0.375% and is based on EVERTEC Group's first lien secured net leverage ratio.\nAll loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty.\nThe senior secured credit facilities contain various restrictive covenants. As a result of the Third Amendment (as defined below), the Term A Loan and the revolving credit facility (subject to certain exceptions) require the Company to maintain on a quarterly basis a specified maximum senior secured leverage ratio of up to 4.75 to 1.00 as defined in the 2013 Credit Agreement (total first lien secured debt to adjusted EBITDA) until September 30, 2018 and 4.25 to 1.00 for any fiscal quarter ending thereafter. In addition, the 2013 Credit Agreement, among other things: (a) limits the Company's ability and the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, as all net assets are restricted, and enter into certain transactions with affiliates; (b) restricts the Company's ability to enter into agreements that would restrict the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to pay dividends or make certain payments to EVERTEC; and (c) places restrictions on the Company's ability and the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Company's assets.\nAmendments to the 2013 Credit Agreement\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, EVERTEC Group, together with certain other direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, entered into a second amendment and waiver to the outstanding Credit Agreement (the \u201cSecond Amendment\u201d). The Company paid each lender that consented to the amendment a fee equal to 0.50% of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding term loans and revolving commitments held by such lender. The credit amendment fees paid during the second quarter of 2016 amounted to $3.6 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, EVERTEC Group, together with certain other direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, entered into a third amendment (the \u201cThird Amendment\u201d) to the 2013 Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment extends the maturity of (a) approximately $219 million of EVERTEC Group's existing approximately $250 million of Term A loan facility to January 17, 2020 (the \u201c2020 Term A loan\u201d) and (b) $65 million of EVERTEC Group's existing $100 million of revolving credit facility to January 17, 2020. The remaining approximately $30 million of Term A loan (the \u201c2018 Term A loan\u201d) and the $35 million of revolving credit facility that were not extended will remain in place and mature as originally scheduled on April 17, 2018. The Term B loan facility will remain in place and mature as originally scheduled on April 17, 2020 (collectively, the \u201cSenior Secured term loans\u201d).\nUnder the terms of the Third Amendment, the 2018 Term A Loan amortizes on a basis of 1.875% of the original principal amount beginning in the third quarter of 2016 and during each of the next three quarters, and 2.50% of the original principal amount during each of the final three quarters, with the balance payable on the final maturity date. The 2020 Term A Loan amortizes on a basis of 1.50% of the original principal amount beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 and during each of the next five quarters, 1.875% of the original principal amount during each of the four subsequent quarters, and 2.50% of the original principal amount during each of the final three quarters, with the balance payable on the final maturity date.\nThe applicable margin under the 2013 Credit Agreement is based on, at EVERTEC Group's option, (i) with respect to any 2018 Term A Loan, 2.50% per annum in the case of any LIBOR Loan and 1.50% per annum in the case of any ABR Loan subject to reduction based on achievement of specific first lien secured leverage ratios, (ii) with respect to any 2020 Term A Loan, 2.50% per annum in the case of any LIBOR Loan and 1.50% per annum in the case of any ABR Loan, (iii) with respect to any Term B Loan, 2.75% per annum in the case of any LIBOR Loan and 1.75% per annum in the case of any ABR Loan subject to reduction based on achievement of specific first lien secured leverage ratios, and (iv) with respect to any Revolving Facility Loan, (A) 2.50% per annum in the case of any LIBOR Loan and (B) 1.50% per annum in the case of any ABR Loan.\nThe unpaid principal balance at December 31, 2016 of the 2018 Term A Loan, the 2020 Term A Loan and the Term B Loan was $29.5 million, $216.0 million and $386.0 million, respectively. The additional borrowing capacity for the Revolving Facility loan at December 31, 2016 was $72.0 million.\nSee Note 11 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nNote payable\nIn December 2014, June 2015, and May 2016, EVERTEC Group entered into non-interest bearing financing agreements amounting to $4.6 million, $1.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, and in October 2016 entered into an interest bearing agreement of $1.1 million, to purchase software. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the outstanding principal balance of the notes payable was $3.4 million and $4.2 million, respectively. The current portion of these notes is recorded as part of accounts payable and the long-term portion is included in other long-term liabilities.\nInterest Rate Swap\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company has the following interest rate swap agreement converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on the Company's Term B loan from variable to fixed:\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective date\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity Date </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Notional Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Variable Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fixed Rate </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>April 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>200 million </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-month LIBOR </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9225 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> The Company has accounted for this transaction as a cash flow hedge. The fair value of the Company's derivative instruments is determined using standard valuation models. The significant inputs used in these models are readily available in public markets, or can be derived from observable market transactions, and therefore have been classified as Level 2. Inputs used in these standard valuation models for derivative instruments include the applicable forward rates and discount rates.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying amount of the derivative on the Company's balance sheet is as follows:\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollar amounts in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other long-term liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>515 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The cash flow hedge is considered highly effective and no impact on earnings is expected due to hedge ineffectiveness.\nCovenant Compliance\nThe credit facilities contain various restrictive covenants. The Term A Loan and the revolving facility (subject to certain exceptions) require EVERTEC Group to maintain on a quarterly basis a specified maximum senior secured leverage ratio of up to 4.75 to 1.00 as defined in the third amendment to the 2013 Credit Agreement (total first lien senior secured debt to Adjusted EBITDA) until September 30, 2018 and 4.25 to 1.00 for any fiscal quarter ending thereafter. In addition, the 2013 Credit Agreement, among other things: (a) limits EVERTEC Group's ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments and enter into certain transactions with affiliates; (b) restricts EVERTEC Group's ability to enter into agreements that would restrict the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make certain payments to its parent company; and (c) places restrictions on EVERTEC Group's ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets. However, all of the covenants in these agreements are subject to significant exceptions. As of December 31, 2016, the senior secured leverage ratio was 3.38 to 1.00. As of the date of filing of this Form 10-K, except as otherwise disclosed to the Administrative Agent (and for which corrective action has been taken and publicly disclosed by the Company in its Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016), no event has occurred that constitutes an Event of Default or Default.\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we refer to the term \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d to mean EBITDA as so defined and calculated for purposes of determining compliance with the senior secured leverage ratio based on the financial information for the last twelve months at the end of each quarter.\nNet Income Reconciliation to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP Measures)\nWe define \u201cEBITDA\u201d as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments described below. We define \u201cAdjusted Net Income\u201d as net income adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments described below.\nWe present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we consider them important supplemental measures of our performance and believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in\nthe evaluation of companies in our industry. In addition, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is consistent with the equivalent measurements that are contained in the senior secured credit facilities in testing EVERTEC Group's compliance with covenants therein such as the senior secured leverage ratio. We use Adjusted Net Income to measure our overall profitability because it better reflects our operating performance by excluding the impact of the non-cash amortization and depreciation that was created as a result of the Merger. In addition, in evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses such as those excluded in calculating them. Further, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future operating results will not be affected by unusual or nonrecurring items.\nSome of the limitations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are as follows:\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>they do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures or future contractual commitments; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>in the case of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, they do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest, or principal payments, on indebtedness; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>in the case of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, they do not reflect income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>other companies, including other companies in our industry, may not use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income or may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income differently than as presented in this Report, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. </td> </tr>\n</table> EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share are not measurements of liquidity or financial performance under GAAP. You should not consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of cash flows, as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to operating or net income determined in accordance with GAAP.\nA reconciliation of

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) covers: (i) the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014; and (ii) the financial condition as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. See Note 1 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Company and the basis of presentation of our financial statements. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere herein. This MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements.\nOverview\nEVERTEC is a leading full-service transaction processing business in Latin America, providing a broad range of merchant acquiring, payment processing and business process management services. According to the September 2016 Nilson Report we are one of the largest merchant acquirers in Latin America based on total number of transactions and we believe we are the largest merchant acquirer in the Caribbean and Central America. We serve 18 countries in the region from our base in Puerto Rico. We manage a system of electronic payment networks that process more than two billion transactions annually, and offer a comprehensive suite of services for core bank processing, cash processing and technology outsourcing. In addition, we own and operate the ATH network, one of the leading personal identification number (\u201cPIN\u201d) debit networks in Latin America. We serve a diversified customer base of leading financial institutions, merchants, corporations and government agencies with \u201cmission-critical\u201d technology solutions that enable them to issue, process and accept transactions securely. We believe our business is well-positioned to continue to expand across the fast-growing Latin American region.\nWe are differentiated, in part, by our diversified business model, which enables us to provide our varied customer base with a broad range of transaction-processing services from a single source across numerous channels and geographic markets. We believe this single-source capability provides several competitive advantages that will enable us to continue to penetrate our existing customer base with complementary new services, win new customers, develop new sales channels and enter new markets. We believe these competitive advantages include:\n \u2022 Our ability to provide in one package a range of services that traditionally had to be sourced from different vendors; \n \u2022 Our ability to serve customers with disparate operations in several geographies with a single integrated technology solution that enables them to manage their business as one enterprise; and \n \u2022 Our ability to capture and analyze data across the transaction processing value chain and use that data to provide value-added services that are differentiated from those offered by pure-play vendors that serve only one portion of the transaction processing value chain (such as only merchant acquiring or payment processing).  Our broad suite of services spans the transaction processing value chain and includes a range of front-end customer-facing solutions such as the electronic capture and authorization of transactions at the point-of-sale, as well as back-end support services such as the clearing and settlement of transactions and account reconciliation for card issuers. These include: (i) merchant acquiring services, which enable point of sales (\u201cPOS\u201d) and e-commerce merchants to accept and process electronic methods of payment such as debit, credit, prepaid and electronic benefit transfer (\u201cEBT\u201d) cards; (ii) payment processing services, which enable financial institutions and other issuers to manage, support and facilitate the processing for credit, debit, prepaid, automated teller machines (\u201cATM\u201d) and EBT card programs; and (iii) business process management solutions, which provide \u201cmission-critical\u201d technology solutions such as core bank processing, as well as IT outsourcing and cash management services to financial institutions, corporations and governments. We provide these services through a highly scalable, end-to-end technology platform that we manage and operate in-house and that generates significant operating efficiencies that enable us to maximize profitability.\nWe sell and distribute our services primarily through a proprietary direct sales force with established customer relationships. We are also building a variety of indirect sales channels that enable us to leverage the distribution capabilities of partners in adjacent markets, including value-added resellers. We continue to pursue joint ventures and merchant acquiring alliances.\nWe benefit from an attractive business model, the hallmarks of which are recurring revenue, scalability, significant operating margins and low capital expenditure requirements. Our revenue is predominantly recurring in nature because of the mission-critical and embedded nature of the services we provide. In addition, we generally negotiate multi-year contracts with our customers. Our business model enables us to continue to grow our business organically without significant incremental capital expenditures.\nSeparation from and Key Relationship with Popular\nPrior to the Merger on September 30, 2010, EVERTEC Group was 100% owned by Popular, the largest financial institution in the Caribbean, and operated substantially as an independent entity within Popular. After the consummation of the Merger, Popular retained an approximately 49% indirect ownership interest in EVERTEC Group and is our largest customer. In connection with, and upon consummation of, the Merger, EVERTEC Group entered into a 15-year Master Services Agreement, and several related agreements with Popular. Under the terms of the Master Services Agreement, Popular agreed to continue to use EVERTEC services on an ongoing exclusive basis, for the duration of the agreement, on commercial terms consistent with those of our historical relationship. Additionally, Popular granted us a right of first refusal on the development of certain new financial technology products and services for the duration of the Master Services Agreement. As of December 31, 2016, Popular retained a 16.05% interest in EVERTEC.\n2016 Developments\nThe Company's Board of Directors approved regular quarterly dividends of $0.10 per common share in February, May, July and October of 2016.\nOn March 1, 2016, the Company completed the purchase of 65% of the share capital of Processa SAS.\nOn November 4, 2016, EVERTEC Group, together with certain other direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, entered into a third amendment to the Credit Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2013. Among other things, the amendment to the Credit Agreement extends the maturity of (a) approximately $219 million of the Borrower's existing approximately $250 million of term loan A facility to January 17, 2020 and (b) $65 million of the Borrower's existing $100 million of revolving credit facility to January 17, 2020. The remaining approximately $30 million of term loan A facility and the $35 million of revolving credit facility that were not extended will remain in place and mature as originally scheduled on April 17, 2018.\nOn December 14, 2016, the Company completed the purchase of certain assets, including the customer relationship, of Accuprint, Inc., a data management and printing services company in Puerto Rico.\nFactors and Trends Affecting the Results of Our Operations\nThe ongoing migration from cash and paper methods of payment to electronic payments continues to benefit the transaction- processing industry globally. We believe that the penetration of electronic payments in the markets in which we operate is significantly lower relative to the U.S. market, and that this ongoing shift will continue to generate substantial growth opportunities for our business. For example, currently the adoption of banking products, including electronic payments, in the Latin American and Caribbean region is lower relative to the mature U.S. and European markets. We believe that the unbanked and underbanked population in our markets will continue to shrink, and therefore drive incremental penetration and growth of electronic payments in Puerto Rico and other Latin American regions. We also benefit from the trend for financial institutions and government\nagencies to outsource technology systems and processes. Many medium- and small-size institutions in the Latin American markets in which we operate have outdated computer systems and updating these IT legacy systems is financially and logistically challenging, which presents a business opportunity for us.\nFinally, our financial condition and results of operations are, in part, dependent on the economic and general conditions of the geographies in which we operate.\nThe Puerto Rico government is experiencing a debt crisis and has defaulted on several of its debt payments, stating that it is unable to both service its debt and continue to provide essential services to its citizens. An emergency moratorium on debt payments was implemented by the Puerto Rico government to ensure continuity of essential services to Puerto Rico citizens. The Puerto Rican government is a large customer of ours and many Puerto Rican businesses and if it is unable to pay its obligations as they become due or at all, this will likely have an adverse impact on the island's economy.\nOn June 30, 2016, the U.S. President signed into law PROMESA. PROMESA establishes a fiscal oversight and the Oversight Board comprised of seven voting members appointed by the President. The Oversight Board has broad budgetary and financial powers over Puerto Rico's budget, laws, financial plans and regulations, including the power to approve restructuring agreements with creditors, file petitions for restructuring and reform the electronic system for the tax collection. The Oversight Board will have ultimate authority in preparing the Puerto Rico government's budget and any issuance of future debt by the government and its instrumentalities. In addition, PROMESA imposes an automatic stay on all litigation against Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities, as well as any other judicial or administrative actions or proceedings to enforce or collect claims against the Puerto Rico government. This stay is currently in effect up to May 2017 and can be extended by the Oversight Board or U.S. District Court of Puerto Rico.\nAs the solution to the Puerto Rican government's debt crisis remains unclear, we continue to carefully monitor our receivables with the government as well as monitor general economic trends to understand the impact the crisis has on the economy of Puerto Rico and our card payment volumes. To date our receivables with the Puerto Rican government and overall payment transaction volumes have not been significantly affected by the debt crisis, however we remain cautious.\nWe are also concerned that the crisis could further accelerate the ongoing emigration trend of Puerto Rico residents to the United States, which has a negative impact on the island's economy and our business.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, and in some instances, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period.\nWe base our assumptions, estimates, and judgments on historical experience, current events and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. However, because future events are inherently uncertain and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. A summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical; require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments; and thus result in estimates that are inherently uncertain.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company's revenue recognition policy follows the guidance from Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 605 Revenue Recognition; ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple Element Arrangements; and; ASC 985, Software, which provide guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when the following four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, (ii) delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the selling price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. For multiple deliverable arrangements, EVERTEC evaluates each arrangement to determine if the elements or deliverables within the arrangement represent separate units of accounting pursuant to ASC 605-25. If the deliverables are determined to be separate units of accounting, revenues are recognized as units of accounting are delivered and the revenue recognition criteria are met. If the deliverables are not determined to be separate units of accounting, revenues for the delivered services are combined into one unit of accounting and recognized (i) over the life of the arrangement if all services are consistently delivered over such term, or if otherwise, (ii) at the time that all services and deliverables have been delivered. The selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence (\u201cVSOE\u201d) if available, third party evidence (\u201cTPE\u201d) if VSOE is not available, or Management's best estimate of selling price (\u201cBESP\u201d) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. EVERTEC establishes VSOE of selling price using the price charged when the same element is sold separately. EVERTEC bifurcates or allocates the arrangement consideration to each of the deliverables based on the relative selling price of each unit of accounting.\nThe Company has two main categories of revenues according to the type of transactions EVERTEC enters into with the Company's customers: (a) transaction-based fees and (b) fixed fees and time and material.\nTransaction-based fees\nThe Company provides services that generate transaction-based fees. Typically transaction-based fees depend on factors such as number of accounts or transactions processed. These factors typically consist of a fee per transaction or item processed, a percentage of dollar volume processed or a fee per account on file, or some combination thereof. Revenue derived from the transaction-based fee contracts are recognized when the underlying transaction is processed, which constitutes delivery of service.\nRevenues from business contracts in the Company's Merchant Acquiring segment are primarily comprised of discount fees charged to the merchants based on the sales amount of transactions processed. Revenues include a discount fee and membership fees charged to merchants and debit network fees as well as point-of-sale (\u201cPOS\u201d) rental fees. Pursuant to the guidance from ASC 605-45-45, Revenue Recognition-Principal Agent Considerations, EVERTEC records Merchant Acquiring revenues net of interchange and assessments charged by the credit and debit card network associations and recognizes such revenues at the time of the sale (when a transaction is processed).\nPayment processing revenues are comprised of revenues related to providing access to the ATH network and other card networks to financial institutions, and related services. Payment processing revenues also include revenues from card issuer processing services (such as credit and debit card processing, authorization and settlement, and fraud monitoring and control to debit or credit card issuers), payment processing services (such as payment and billing products for merchants, businesses and financial institutions) and EBT (which principally consists of services to the Puerto Rico government for the delivery of government benefits to participants). Revenues in EVERTEC's Payment Processing segment are primarily comprised of fees per transaction processed or per account on file, or a combination of both, and are recognized at the time transactions are processed or on a monthly basis for accounts on file.\nTransaction-based fees within EVERTEC's Business Solutions segment consist of revenues from business process management solutions including core bank processing, business process outsourcing, item and cash processing, and fulfillment. Transaction-based fee revenues generated by the Company's core bank processing services are derived from fees based on various factors such as the number of accounts on file (e.g. savings or checking accounts, loans, etc.), and the number of transactions processed or registered users (e.g. for online banking services). For services dependent on the number of transactions processed, revenues are recognized as the underlying transactions are processed. For services dependent on the number of users or accounts on file, revenues are recognized on a monthly basis based on the number of accounts on file each month. Item and cash processing revenues are based upon the number of items (e.g. checks) processed and revenues are recognized when the underlying item is processed. Fulfillment services include technical and operational resources for producing and distributing variable print documents such as statements, bills, checks and benefits summaries. Fulfillment revenues are based upon the number pages for printing services and the number of envelopes processed for mailing services. Revenues are recognized as services are delivered based on a fee per page printed or envelope mailed, as applicable.\nFixed fees and time and material\nThe Company also provides services that generate a fixed fee per month or fees based on time and expenses incurred. These services are mostly provided in EVERTEC's Business Solutions segment. Revenues are generated from EVERTEC's core bank solutions, network hosting and management and IT consulting services.\nIn core bank solutions, the Company mostly provides access to applications and services such as back-up or recovery, hosting and maintenance that enable a bank to operate the related hosted services accessing the Company's IT infrastructure. These contracts generally contain multiple elements or deliverables which are evaluated by EVERTEC and revenues are recognized according to the applicable guidance. Revenue is derived from fixed fees charged for the use of hosted services and are recognized on a monthly basis as delivered. Set-up fees are billed to the customer when the service is rendered; however, they are deferred and recognized as revenues over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of the customer relationship, whichever is longer, as set-up services rarely provide value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and are interrelated with the service to be provided under the contract.\nIn network hosting and management, EVERTEC provides hosting services for network infrastructure at EVETEC's facilities; automated monitoring services; maintenance of call centers; interactive voice response solutions, among other related services. Revenues are primarily derived from monthly fees as services are delivered. Set-up fees are billed up-front to the customer when the set-up service is rendered; however, they are deferred and recognized as revenues over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of the customer relationship, whichever is longer, as set-up services rarely provide value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and are interrelated with the service under the contract. There are some arrangements under this line of service category that may contain undelivered elements. In such cases, the undelivered elements are evaluated and recognized when the services are delivered or at the time that all deliverables under the contract have been delivered.\nIT consulting services revenue primarily consists of time billings based upon the number of hours dedicated to each client. Revenue from time billings are recognized as services are delivered.\nEVERTEC also charges members of the ATH network an annual membership fee; however, these fees are deferred and recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over the year and recorded in the Company's Payment Processing segment. In addition, occasionally EVERTEC is a reseller of hardware and software products and revenues from these resale transactions are recognized when such product is delivered and accepted by the client.\nService level arrangements\nThe Company's service contracts may include service level arrangements (\u201cSLA\u201d) generally allowing the customer to receive a credit for part of the service fee when the Company has not provided the agreed level of services. The SLA performance obligation is committed on a monthly basis, thus SLA performance is monitored and assessed for compliance with arrangements on a monthly basis, including determination and accounting for its economic impact, if any.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment.\nFor 2016, the Company used a \u201cqualitative assessment\u201d option or \u201cstep zero\u201d for the goodwill impairment test for all of its reporting units. With this process, the Company first assesses whether it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the answer is no, then the fair value of the reporting unit does not need to be measured, and step one and step two, as explained below, are bypassed. In assessing the fair value of a reporting unit, which is based on the nature of the business and reporting unit's current and expected financial performance, the Company uses a combination of factors such as industry and market conditions, overall financial performance and the entity and reporting unit specific events.\nIn the past, the goodwill impairment test used was a two-step process at each reporting unit level. The first step used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis is required. The second step consists of comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, no impairment losses associated with goodwill were recognized.\nOther identifiable intangible assets with a definitive useful life are amortized using the straight-line method or an accelerated method. These intangibles are evaluated periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nOther identifiable intangible assets with a definitive useful life include a customer relationship, trademark, software packages and a non-compete agreement acquired during September 2010 when Apollo acquired a 51% indirect ownership interest in EVERTEC as part of a merger (the \u201cMerger\u201d); a customer relationship asset acquired in 2015 from a local bank in Puerto Rico, and customer relationship assets acquired as part of business combination transactions in 2016.\nThe customer relationship assets were valued using the excess earnings method under the income approach. Trademark assets were valued using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. Software packages, which include capitalized software development costs, were recorded at cost. The non-compete agreement was valued based on the estimated impact that theoretical competition would have on revenues and expenses.\nIncome Tax\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. A temporary difference refers to a difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability, determined based on recognition and measurement requirements for\ntax positions, and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future effects on income taxes that result from temporary differences and carryforwards that exist at the end of a period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and provisions of the enacted tax law and are not discounted to reflect the time-value of money. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income in the period that includes the enactment date. A deferred tax valuation allowance is established if it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nThe Company recognizes the benefit of uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement or disposition of the underlying issue with the taxing authority. Accordingly, the amount of benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements may differ from the amount taken or expected to be taken in the tax return resulting in unrecognized tax benefits (\u201cUTBs\u201d). The Company recognizes the interest and penalties associated with UTBs as part of the provision for income taxes on its consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Accrued interest and penalties are included on the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAll companies within EVERTEC are legal entities which file separate income tax returns.\nShare-based Compensation\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock-based awards, on a contemporaneous basis, at the date they are granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model for Tranche A options and the Monte Carlo simulation analysis for Tranche B and Tranche C options and market based restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) using the following assumptions: (1) stock price; (2) risk-free rate; (3) expected volatility; (4) expected annual dividend yield and (5) expected term. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Constant Maturities Treasury Interest Rate as of the grant date or the yield of a 2-year or 3-year Treasury bond, as applicable. The expected volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility and implied volatility from publicly traded companies in the Company's industry. The expected annual dividend yield is based on management's expectations of future dividends as of the grant date and, in certain cases, assumes that those dividends will be reinvested over the performance period. The expected term for stock options granted under the 2010 Plan was based on the vesting time of the options. For the stock options granted under the 2013 Plan, the simplified method was used to estimate the expected term, given that the Company did not have appropriate exercise data on which to base the estimate nor is exercise data relating to employees of comparable companies easily obtainable. Performance and time based RSUs and restricted stock are valued based on the market price of the Company's stock at the grant date.\nUpon option exercise or restricted stock or RSUs release, participants may elect to \u201cnet share settle\u201d. Rather than requiring the participant to deliver cash to satisfy the exercise price, for options exercise, and statutory minimum tax withholdings, the Company withholds a sufficient number of shares to cover these amounts and delivers the net shares to the participant. The Company recognizes the associated tax withholding obligation as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.\nAs compensation expense is recognized, a deferred tax asset is established. At the time stock options are exercised, restricted stock or RSUs are released, a current tax deduction arises based on the value at the time of exercise or release. This deduction may exceed the associated deferred tax asset, resulting in a \u201cwindfall tax benefit\u201d. The windfall is recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as an increase to additional paid-in capital, and is included in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing inflow.\nIn determining the amount of cash tax savings realized from the excess share-based compensation deductions, the Company follows the tax law ordering approach. Under this approach, the utilization of excess tax deductions\nassociated with share-based awards is dictated by provision in the tax law that identify the sequence in which such benefits are utilized for tax purposes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of recent accounting standards, see Note 2 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per common share, as presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. They are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to total revenues, net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as measures of our liquidity.\nFor more information regarding EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per common share, including a quantitative reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per common share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial performance measure, which is net income, see \u201c-Net Income Reconciliation to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per common share\u201d and \u201c-Covenant Compliance\u201d below.\nOverview of Results of Operations\nThe following briefly describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Descriptions of the revenue recognition policies are detailed in Note 1 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMerchant Acquiring, net. Merchant Acquiring revenue consists of income from services that allow merchants to accept electronic methods of payment. Our standard merchant contract has an initial term of one or three years, with automatic one-year renewal periods. In the Merchant Acquiring segment, sources of revenue include a discount fee (generally a percentage of the sales amount of a credit or debit card transaction value) and membership fees charged to merchants, debit network fees and rental income from POS devices and other equipment, net of credit card interchange and assessment fees charged by credit card associations (such as VISA or MasterCard) or payment networks.\nPayment Processing. Payment Processing revenue comprises income related to providing financial institutions access to the ATH network and other card networks, including related services such as authorization, processing, management and recording of ATM and POS transactions, and ATM management and monitoring. Payment Processing revenue also includes income from card processing services for debit or credit issuers, such as credit and debit card processing, authorization and settlement and fraud monitoring and control services; payment processing services such as payment and billing products for merchants, businesses and financial institutions; and EBT, which principally consists of services to the Puerto Rico government for the delivery of government benefits to participants. Payment products include electronic check processing, automated clearing house (\u201cACH\u201d), lockbox, interactive voice response and web-based payments through personalized websites, among others.\nWe generally enter into one to five year contracts with our private payment processing clients and one year contracts with our government payment processing clients. For ATH network and processing services, revenue is driven mainly by the number of transactions processed. Revenue is derived mainly from network fees, transaction", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) covers: (i) the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014; and (ii) the financial condition as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. See Note 1 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Company and the basis of presentation of our financial statements. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere herein. This MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements.\nOverview\nEVERTEC is a leading full-service transaction processing business in Latin America, providing a broad range of merchant acquiring, payment processing and business process management services. According to the September 2016 Nilson Report we are one of the largest merchant acquirers in Latin America based on total number of transactions and we believe we are the largest merchant acquirer in the Caribbean and Central America. We serve 18 countries in the region from our base in Puerto Rico. We manage a system of electronic payment networks that process more than two billion transactions annually, and offer a comprehensive suite of services for core bank processing, cash processing and technology outsourcing. In addition, we own and operate the ATH network, one of the leading personal identification number (\u201cPIN\u201d) debit networks in Latin America. We serve a diversified customer base of leading financial institutions, merchants, corporations and government agencies with \u201cmission-critical\u201d technology solutions that enable them to issue, process and accept transactions securely. We believe our business is well-positioned to continue to expand across the fast-growing Latin American region.\nWe are differentiated, in part, by our diversified business model, which enables us to provide our varied customer base with a broad range of transaction-processing services from a single source across numerous channels and geographic markets. We believe this single-source capability provides several competitive advantages that will enable us to continue to penetrate our existing customer base with complementary new services, win new customers, develop new sales channels and enter new markets. We believe these competitive advantages include:\n \u2022 Our ability to provide in one package a range of services that traditionally had to be sourced from different vendors; \n \u2022 Our ability to serve customers with disparate operations in several geographies with a single integrated technology solution that enables them to manage their business as one enterprise; and \n \u2022 Our ability to capture and analyze data across the transaction processing value chain and use that data to provide value-added services that are differentiated from those offered by pure-play vendors that serve only one portion of the transaction processing value chain (such as only merchant acquiring or payment processing).  Our broad suite of services spans the transaction processing value chain and includes a range of front-end customer-facing solutions such as the electronic capture and authorization of transactions at the point-of-sale, as well as back-end support services such as the clearing and settlement of transactions and account reconciliation for card issuers. These include: (i) merchant acquiring services, which enable point of sales (\u201cPOS\u201d) and e-commerce merchants to accept and process electronic methods of payment such as debit, credit, prepaid and electronic benefit transfer (\u201cEBT\u201d) cards; (ii) payment processing services, which enable financial institutions and other issuers to manage, support and facilitate the processing for credit, debit, prepaid, automated teller machines (\u201cATM\u201d) and EBT card programs; and (iii) business process management solutions, which provide \u201cmission-critical\u201d technology solutions such as core bank processing, as well as IT outsourcing and cash management services to financial institutions, corporations and governments. We provide these services through a highly scalable, end-to-end technology platform that we manage and operate in-house and that generates significant operating efficiencies that enable us to maximize profitability.\nWe sell and distribute our services primarily through a proprietary direct sales force with established customer relationships. We are also building a variety of indirect sales channels that enable us to leverage the distribution capabilities of partners in adjacent markets, including value-added resellers. We continue to pursue joint ventures and merchant acquiring alliances.\nWe benefit from an attractive business model, the hallmarks of which are recurring revenue, scalability, significant operating margins and low capital expenditure requirements. Our revenue is predominantly recurring in nature because of the mission-critical and embedded nature of the services we provide. In addition, we generally negotiate multi-year contracts with our customers. Our business model enables us to continue to grow our business organically without significant incremental capital expenditures.\nSeparation from and Key Relationship with Popular\nPrior to the Merger on September 30, 2010, EVERTEC Group was 100% owned by Popular, the largest financial institution in the Caribbean, and operated substantially as an independent entity within Popular. After the consummation of the Merger, Popular retained an approximately 49% indirect ownership interest in EVERTEC Group and is our largest customer. In connection with, and upon consummation of, the Merger, EVERTEC Group entered into a 15-year Master Services Agreement, and several related agreements with Popular. Under the terms of the Master Services Agreement, Popular agreed to continue to use EVERTEC services on an ongoing exclusive basis, for the duration of the agreement, on commercial terms consistent with those of our historical relationship. Additionally, Popular granted us a right of first refusal on the development of certain new financial technology products and services for the duration of the Master Services Agreement. As of December 31, 2016, Popular retained a 16.05% interest in EVERTEC.\n2016 Developments\nThe Company's Board of Directors approved regular quarterly dividends of $0.10 per common share in February, May, July and October of 2016.\nOn March 1, 2016, the Company completed the purchase of 65% of the share capital of Processa SAS.\nOn November 4, 2016, EVERTEC Group, together with certain other direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, entered into a third amendment to the Credit Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2013. Among other things, the amendment to the Credit Agreement extends the maturity of (a) approximately $219 million of the Borrower's existing approximately $250 million of term loan A facility to January 17, 2020 and (b) $65 million of the Borrower's existing $100 million of revolving credit facility to January 17, 2020. The remaining approximately $30 million of term loan A facility and the $35 million of revolving credit facility that were not extended will remain in place and mature as originally scheduled on April 17, 2018.\nOn December 14, 2016, the Company completed the purchase of certain assets, including the customer relationship, of Accuprint, Inc., a data management and printing services company in Puerto Rico.\nFactors and Trends Affecting the Results of Our Operations\nThe ongoing migration from cash and paper methods of payment to electronic payments continues to benefit the transaction- processing industry globally. We believe that the penetration of electronic payments in the markets in which we operate is significantly lower relative to the U.S. market, and that this ongoing shift will continue to generate substantial growth opportunities for our business. For example, currently the adoption of banking products, including electronic payments, in the Latin American and Caribbean region is lower relative to the mature U.S. and European markets. We believe that the unbanked and underbanked population in our markets will continue to shrink, and therefore drive incremental penetration and growth of electronic payments in Puerto Rico and other Latin American regions. We also benefit from the trend for financial institutions and government\nagencies to outsource technology systems and processes. Many medium- and small-size institutions in the Latin American markets in which we operate have outdated computer systems and updating these IT legacy systems is financially and logistically challenging, which presents a business opportunity for us.\nFinally, our financial condition and results of operations are, in part, dependent on the economic and general conditions of the geographies in which we operate.\nThe Puerto Rico government is experiencing a debt crisis and has defaulted on several of its debt payments, stating that it is unable to both service its debt and continue to provide essential services to its citizens. An emergency moratorium on debt payments was implemented by the Puerto Rico government to ensure continuity of essential services to Puerto Rico citizens. The Puerto Rican government is a large customer of ours and many Puerto Rican businesses and if it is unable to pay its obligations as they become due or at all, this will likely have an adverse impact on the island's economy.\nOn June 30, 2016, the U.S. President signed into law PROMESA. PROMESA establishes a fiscal oversight and the Oversight Board comprised of seven voting members appointed by the President. The Oversight Board has broad budgetary and financial powers over Puerto Rico's budget, laws, financial plans and regulations, including the power to approve restructuring agreements with creditors, file petitions for restructuring and reform the electronic system for the tax collection. The Oversight Board will have ultimate authority in preparing the Puerto Rico government's budget and any issuance of future debt by the government and its instrumentalities. In addition, PROMESA imposes an automatic stay on all litigation against Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities, as well as any other judicial or administrative actions or proceedings to enforce or collect claims against the Puerto Rico government. This stay is currently in effect up to May 2017 and can be extended by the Oversight Board or U.S. District Court of Puerto Rico.\nAs the solution to the Puerto Rican government's debt crisis remains unclear, we continue to carefully monitor our receivables with the government as well as monitor general economic trends to understand the impact the crisis has on the economy of Puerto Rico and our card payment volumes. To date our receivables with the Puerto Rican government and overall payment transaction volumes have not been significantly affected by the debt crisis, however we remain cautious.\nWe are also concerned that the crisis could further accelerate the ongoing emigration trend of Puerto Rico residents to the United States, which has a negative impact on the island's economy and our business.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, and in some instances, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period.\nWe base our assumptions, estimates, and judgments on historical experience, current events and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. However, because future events are inherently uncertain and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. A summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical; require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments; and thus result in estimates that are inherently uncertain.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company's revenue recognition policy follows the guidance from Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 605 Revenue Recognition; ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple Element Arrangements; and; ASC 985, Software, which provide guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when the following four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, (ii) delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the selling price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. For multiple deliverable arrangements, EVERTEC evaluates each arrangement to determine if the elements or deliverables within the arrangement represent separate units of accounting pursuant to ASC 605-25. If the deliverables are determined to be separate units of accounting, revenues are recognized as units of accounting are delivered and the revenue recognition criteria are met. If the deliverables are not determined to be separate units of accounting, revenues for the delivered services are combined into one unit of accounting and recognized (i) over the life of the arrangement if all services are consistently delivered over such term, or if otherwise, (ii) at the time that all services and deliverables have been delivered. The selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence (\u201cVSOE\u201d) if available, third party evidence (\u201cTPE\u201d) if VSOE is not available, or Management's best estimate of selling price (\u201cBESP\u201d) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. EVERTEC establishes VSOE of selling price using the price charged when the same element is sold separately. EVERTEC bifurcates or allocates the arrangement consideration to each of the deliverables based on the relative selling price of each unit of accounting.\nThe Company has two main categories of revenues according to the type of transactions EVERTEC enters into with the Company's customers: (a) transaction-based fees and (b) fixed fees and time and material.\nTransaction-based fees\nThe Company provides services that generate transaction-based fees. Typically transaction-based fees depend on factors such as number of accounts or transactions processed. These factors typically consist of a fee per transaction or item processed, a percentage of dollar volume processed or a fee per account on file, or some combination thereof. Revenue derived from the transaction-based fee contracts are recognized when the underlying transaction is processed, which constitutes delivery of service.\nRevenues from business contracts in the Company's Merchant Acquiring segment are primarily comprised of discount fees charged to the merchants based on the sales amount of transactions processed. Revenues include a discount fee and membership fees charged to merchants and debit network fees as well as point-of-sale (\u201cPOS\u201d) rental fees. Pursuant to the guidance from ASC 605-45-45, Revenue Recognition-Principal Agent Considerations, EVERTEC records Merchant Acquiring revenues net of interchange and assessments charged by the credit and debit card network associations and recognizes such revenues at the time of the sale (when a transaction is processed).\nPayment processing revenues are comprised of revenues related to providing access to the ATH network and other card networks to financial institutions, and related services. Payment processing revenues also include revenues from card issuer processing services (such as credit and debit card processing, authorization and settlement, and fraud monitoring and control to debit or credit card issuers), payment processing services (such as payment and billing products for merchants, businesses and financial institutions) and EBT (which principally consists of services to the Puerto Rico government for the delivery of government benefits to participants). Revenues in EVERTEC's Payment Processing segment are primarily comprised of fees per transaction processed or per account on file, or a combination of both, and are recognized at the time transactions are processed or on a monthly basis for accounts on file.\nTransaction-based fees within EVERTEC's Business Solutions segment consist of revenues from business process management solutions including core bank processing, business process outsourcing, item and cash processing, and fulfillment. Transaction-based fee revenues generated by the Company's core bank processing services are derived from fees based on various factors such as the number of accounts on file (e.g. savings or checking accounts, loans, etc.), and the number of transactions processed or registered users (e.g. for online banking services). For services dependent on the number of transactions processed, revenues are recognized as the underlying transactions are processed. For services dependent on the number of users or accounts on file, revenues are recognized on a monthly basis based on the number of accounts on file each month. Item and cash processing revenues are based upon the number of items (e.g. checks) processed and revenues are recognized when the underlying item is processed. Fulfillment services include technical and operational resources for producing and distributing variable print documents such as statements, bills, checks and benefits summaries. Fulfillment revenues are based upon the number pages for printing services and the number of envelopes processed for mailing services. Revenues are recognized as services are delivered based on a fee per page printed or envelope mailed, as applicable.\nFixed fees and time and material\nThe Company also provides services that generate a fixed fee per month or fees based on time and expenses incurred. These services are mostly provided in EVERTEC's Business Solutions segment. Revenues are generated from EVERTEC's core bank solutions, network hosting and management and IT consulting services.\nIn core bank solutions, the Company mostly provides access to applications and services such as back-up or recovery, hosting and maintenance that enable a bank to operate the related hosted services accessing the Company's IT infrastructure. These contracts generally contain multiple elements or deliverables which are evaluated by EVERTEC and revenues are recognized according to the applicable guidance. Revenue is derived from fixed fees charged for the use of hosted services and are recognized on a monthly basis as delivered. Set-up fees are billed to the customer when the service is rendered; however, they are deferred and recognized as revenues over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of the customer relationship, whichever is longer, as set-up services rarely provide value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and are interrelated with the service to be provided under the contract.\nIn network hosting and management, EVERTEC provides hosting services for network infrastructure at EVETEC's facilities; automated monitoring services; maintenance of call centers; interactive voice response solutions, among other related services. Revenues are primarily derived from monthly fees as services are delivered. Set-up fees are billed up-front to the customer when the set-up service is rendered; however, they are deferred and recognized as revenues over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of the customer relationship, whichever is longer, as set-up services rarely provide value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and are interrelated with the service under the contract. There are some arrangements under this line of service category that may contain undelivered elements. In such cases, the undelivered elements are evaluated and recognized when the services are delivered or at the time that all deliverables under the contract have been delivered.\nIT consulting services revenue primarily consists of time billings based upon the number of hours dedicated to each client. Revenue from time billings are recognized as services are delivered.\nEVERTEC also charges members of the ATH network an annual membership fee; however, these fees are deferred and recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over the year and recorded in the Company's Payment Processing segment. In addition, occasionally EVERTEC is a reseller of hardware and software products and revenues from these resale transactions are recognized when such product is delivered and accepted by the client.\nService level arrangements\nThe Company's service contracts may include service level arrangements (\u201cSLA\u201d) generally allowing the customer to receive a credit for part of the service fee when the Company has not provided the agreed level of services. The SLA performance obligation is committed on a monthly basis, thus SLA performance is monitored and assessed for compliance with arrangements on a monthly basis, including determination and accounting for its economic impact, if any.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment.\nFor 2016, the Company used a \u201cqualitative assessment\u201d option or \u201cstep zero\u201d for the goodwill impairment test for all of its reporting units. With this process, the Company first assesses whether it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the answer is no, then the fair value of the reporting unit does not need to be measured, and step one and step two, as explained below, are bypassed. In assessing the fair value of a reporting unit, which is based on the nature of the business and reporting unit's current and expected financial performance, the Company uses a combination of factors such as industry and market conditions, overall financial performance and the entity and reporting unit specific events.\nIn the past, the goodwill impairment test used was a two-step process at each reporting unit level. The first step used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis is required. The second step consists of comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, no impairment losses associated with goodwill were recognized.\nOther identifiable intangible assets with a definitive useful life are amortized using the straight-line method or an accelerated method. These intangibles are evaluated periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nOther identifiable intangible assets with a definitive useful life include a customer relationship, trademark, software packages and a non-compete agreement acquired during September 2010 when Apollo acquired a 51% indirect ownership interest in EVERTEC as part of a merger (the \u201cMerger\u201d); a customer relationship asset acquired in 2015 from a local bank in Puerto Rico, and customer relationship assets acquired as part of business combination transactions in 2016.\nThe customer relationship assets were valued using the excess earnings method under the income approach. Trademark assets were valued using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. Software packages, which include capitalized software development costs, were recorded at cost. The non-compete agreement was valued based on the estimated impact that theoretical competition would have on revenues and expenses.\nIncome Tax\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. A temporary difference refers to a difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability, determined based on recognition and measurement requirements for\ntax positions, and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future effects on income taxes that result from temporary differences and carryforwards that exist at the end of a period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and provisions of the enacted tax law and are not discounted to reflect the time-value of money. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income in the period that includes the enactment date. A deferred tax valuation allowance is established if it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nThe Company recognizes the benefit of uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement or disposition of the underlying issue with the taxing authority. Accordingly, the amount of benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements may differ from the amount taken or expected to be taken in the tax return resulting in unrecognized tax benefits (\u201cUTBs\u201d). The Company recognizes the interest and penalties associated with UTBs as part of the provision for income taxes on its consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Accrued interest and penalties are included on the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAll companies within EVERTEC are legal entities which file separate income tax returns.\nShare-based Compensation\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock-based awards, on a contemporaneous basis, at the date they are granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model for Tranche A options and the Monte Carlo simulation analysis for Tranche B and Tranche C options and market based restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) using the following assumptions: (1) stock price; (2) risk-free rate; (3) expected volatility; (4) expected annual dividend yield and (5) expected term. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Constant Maturities Treasury Interest Rate as of the grant date or the yield of a 2-year or 3-year Treasury bond, as applicable. The expected volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility and implied volatility from publicly traded companies in the Company's industry. The expected annual dividend yield is based on management's expectations of future dividends as of the grant date and, in certain cases, assumes that those dividends will be reinvested over the performance period. The expected term for stock options granted under the 2010 Plan was based on the vesting time of the options. For the stock options granted under the 2013 Plan, the simplified method was used to estimate the expected term, given that the Company did not have appropriate exercise data on which to base the estimate nor is exercise data relating to employees of comparable companies easily obtainable. Performance and time based RSUs and restricted stock are valued based on the market price of the Company's stock at the grant date.\nUpon option exercise or restricted stock or RSUs release, participants may elect to \u201cnet share settle\u201d. Rather than requiring the participant to deliver cash to satisfy the exercise price, for options exercise, and statutory minimum tax withholdings, the Company withholds a sufficient number of shares to cover these amounts and delivers the net shares to the participant. The Company recognizes the associated tax withholding obligation as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.\nAs compensation expense is recognized, a deferred tax asset is established. At the time stock options are exercised, restricted stock or RSUs are released, a current tax deduction arises based on the value at the time of exercise or release. This deduction may exceed the associated deferred tax asset, resulting in a \u201cwindfall tax benefit\u201d. The windfall is recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as an increase to additional paid-in capital, and is included in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing inflow.\nIn determining the amount of cash tax savings realized from the excess share-based compensation deductions, the Company follows the tax law ordering approach. Under this approach, the utilization of excess tax deductions\nassociated with share-based awards is dictated by provision in the tax law that identify the sequence in which such benefits are utilized for tax purposes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of recent accounting standards, see Note 2 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per common share, as presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP.
