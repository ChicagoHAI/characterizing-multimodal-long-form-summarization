Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\nThe following discussion is intended to analyze major elements of our consolidated financial statements and provide insight into important areas of management's focus. This section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Statements in the following discussion may include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d for additional discussion of these factors and risks.\nFollowing the acquisition of SwiftWater and the disposition of the Offshore Division during the three month period ended March 31, 2018, we reorganized our reporting segments and now manage our operations through three divisions: Completion Fluids & Products, Water & Flowback Services, and Compression. Our Completion Fluids & Products Division was previously reported as our Fluids Division, and included our water management services operations. Following the acquisition of SwiftWater in February 2018, our expanded water management operations are now included with our production testing operations as part of our Water & Flowback Services Division. The operations of our previous Offshore Division, consisting of our previous Offshore Services and Maritech segments, are now reported as discontinued operations following their disposal in March 2018.\nBusiness Overview\nOur consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflected the strong improvement in demand for the products and services of many of our businesses. A strong increase in demand for compression equipment and services resulted in our Compression Division contributing a $143.1 million increase to consolidated revenues compared to 2017 and generating improved gross profit compared to the prior year primarily as a result of improved pricing. Improved onshore domestic rig counts and completion activity during 2018, along with the acquisition of SwiftWater Energy Services, LLC (\"SwiftWater\") during February 2018, led to the growth of our Water & Flowback Services Division, which reported increased revenues of $131.5 million compared to 2017, along with significantly increased gross profit compared to the prior year. Our Completion Fluids & Products Division reported revenues during 2018 consistent with 2017 levels, despite benefiting in the prior year from a TETRA CS Neptune\u00ae completion fluids project, as international activity increased compared to the prior year. Future profitability levels of our Completion Fluids & Products Division will continue to be affected by the timing of future TETRA CS Neptune projects. On a consolidated basis, the increased revenues and gross profit during 2018 were partially offset by increased general and administrative cost levels, reflecting the overall growth in our operations, as well as by increased interest expense, primarily from increased borrowings by our CSI Compressco LP subsidiary (\"CCLP\"). The improved 2018 results occurred despite the impact of decreased oil prices during the fourth quarter of 2018. We are monitoring the 2019 spending plans of our customers as a result of the current reduced oil prices, and if oil prices decrease further during 2019, demand for many of our products and services could be negatively impacted. The consolidated net loss for 2018 includes the impact of the loss attributed to the March 2018 disposal of our former Offshore Division. That disposition increased our ability to focus on the growth of our core businesses.\nOur consolidated cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $18.0 million, or 27.9%, compared to the prior year. This decrease in consolidated cash provided by operating activities was driven primarily by increased working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventory, driven by the growth of certain of our businesses, and despite increased operating profitability. We and CCLP continue to maintain our efforts to manage working capital. Consolidated capital expenditures were $141.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, and included $104.0 million of capital expenditures by our Compression Division, compared to $51.9 million of consolidated capital expenditures during the prior year, which included $25.9 million by our Compression Division. Capital expenditure levels continue to be monitored carefully for each of our businesses, including CCLP, to insure that capital investments are only made for the most attractive growth opportunities. A majority of CCLP capital expenditures during 2018 were funded by additional long-term debt borrowings. As obtaining additional financing is challenging in the current debt and equity market environment, growth capital expenditures by CCLP during 2019 are expected to be primarily funded by available cash, expected cash provided by operating activities, and up to $15.0 million of new compression services equipment to be purchased by us, whereby we will lease the equipment to CCLP under a finance lease.\nDuring 2018, we continued our focus on enhancing our debt structure, as well as the debt structure of CCLP. During the third quarter of 2018, we entered into a new credit agreement (the Term Credit Agreement\u201d) which provided an initial loan in the amount of $200 million and the availability of additional loans, subject to the terms of the Term Credit Agreement, up to an aggregate amount of $75 million for acquisitions. In addition, during the third quarter of 2018, we entered into an asset-based lending credit agreement (the ABL Credit Agreement\u201d)\nthat provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to $100 million, subject to a borrowing base. As of December 31, 2018, subject to compliance with the covenants, borrowing base, and other provisions of the agreement that may limit borrowings, TETRA had an availability of $47.6 million under this agreement. Proceeds from both the Term Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement were used to repay our 11% Senior Secured Note due November 5, 2022 (the \"11% Senior Notes\") and repay all outstanding borrowings and obligations under our then existing bank credit agreement. Both the note-purchase agreement related to the 11% Senior Note and the then existing bank credit agreement were terminated. To fund its growth, during the first half of 2018, CCLP enhanced its long-term debt structure through the issuance of the CCLP 7.50% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2025 (the \"CCLP Senior Secured Notes\"), repaying and terminating CCLP's prior credit facility (the \"CCLP Prior Credit Facility\"), and entering into a Loan and Security Agreement (the \"CCLP Credit Agreement\"), which provides up to $50.0 million to fund ongoing working capital and letter of credit needs and for general business purposes. As of December 31, 2018, and subject to compliance with the covenants, borrowing base, and other provisions of the agreements that may limit borrowings under the CCLP Credit Agreement, CCLP had availability of $27.1 million. As of March 1, 2019, no borrowings are outstanding under the ABL Credit Agreement or the CCLP Credit Agreement. Key objectives associated with our separate capital structures include the ongoing management of amounts outstanding and available under our ABL Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement, and the CCLP Credit Agreement.\nWe do not analyze or manage our capital structure on a consolidated basis, as there are no cross default provisions, cross collateralization provisions, or cross guarantees between CCLP's long-term debt and TETRA's long-term debt.\nApproximately $633.0 million of our consolidated debt balance carrying value is owed by CCLP and serviced by CCLP's existing cash balances and cash provided by CCLP's operations (less its capital expenditures) and $343.2 million of which is secured by certain assets of CCLP. The following table provides condensed consolidating balance sheet information reflecting our net assets, excluding CCLP (\"TETRA\"), and CCLP's net assets that service our respective capital structures.\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Condensed Consolidating Balance Sheet\n</td> <td>TETRA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CCLP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Eliminations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, excluding restricted cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Affiliate receivables\n</td> <td>3,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,517\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets of discontinued operations\n</td> <td>1,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other current assets\n</td> <td>223,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>359,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property, plant and equipment, net\n</td> <td>212,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>641,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>853,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other assets, including investment in CCLP\n</td> <td>29,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>494,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>826,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,385,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Affiliate payables\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,517\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion of long-term debt\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other current liabilities\n</td> <td>105,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, net\n</td> <td>182,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>633,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>815,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CCLP Series A Preferred Units\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,881\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warrant liability\n</td> <td>2,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-current liabilities\n</td> <td>26,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total equity\n</td> <td>173,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>312,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities and equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>494,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>826,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,385,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTETRA's debt is serviced by existing cash balances and cash provided from operating activities (excluding CCLP) and the distributions we receive from CCLP in excess of our cash capital expenditures (excluding CCLP). During the year ended December 31, 2018, consolidated cash provided from operating activities was $46.6 million, which included approximately $30.1 million generated by CCLP. During 2018, we received $12.1 million from CCLP as our share of CCLP distributions. In December 2018,CCLP announced a significant reduction, for a period of up to four quarters, in the level of cash distributions to its common unitholders, including us, reducing the distribution to $0.04 per common unit per year. CCLP intends to use the cash savings from the reduced distributions to redeem the remaining CCLP Preferred Units outstanding. Despite this reduced level of cash distributions from CCLP to us, we believe that current increased levels of operating activity will allow us and CCLP to continue to meet our respective financial obligations and fund our respective future growth plans as needed.\nFuture demand for our products and services depends primarily on activity in the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry, particularly including the level of expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas reserves, and natural gas compression infrastructure. The future growth of certain of our businesses is dependent on improved future pricing levels of oil and natural gas. When oil and natural gas prices increase, we believe that there are growth opportunities for our products and services, supported primarily by:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increases in technologically driven deepwater oil and gas well completions in the Gulf of Mexico;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>applications for many of our products and services in the continuing exploitation and development of shale reservoirs; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increases in selected international oil and gas exploration and development activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Completion Fluids & Products Division generates revenues and cash flows by manufacturing and marketing clear brine fluids (\"CBFs\"), additives, and associated products and services to the oil and gas industry for use in well drilling, completion, and workover operations in the United States and in certain countries in Latin America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The Completion Fluids & Products Division also markets liquid and dry calcium chloride products manufactured at its production facilities or purchased from third-party suppliers to a variety of markets outside the energy industry. Completion Fluids & Products Division revenues decreased $0.4 million during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to product and services sales revenues during 2017 associated with a TETRA CS Neptune completion fluid project, and despite improving demand for CBFs and associated product sales in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during 2018. While offshore rig counts remain low, we have seen an increase in demand from our customers. In addition, international offshore fluid sales and onshore manufactured product sales increased compared to the prior year.\nOur Water & Flowback Services Division provides oil and gas operators with comprehensive water management services as well as frac flowback, production well testing, offshore rig cooling, and other associated services in many of the major oil and gas producing regions in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, as well as in oil and gas basins in certain regions in South America, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Australia. The Water & Flowback Services Division's operations are generally driven by the demand for natural gas and oil and the resulting levels of drilling and completion activities in the markets that the Water & Flowback Services Division serves. Many of the markets served by the Water & Flowback Services Division are characterized by high lifting costs for oil and natural gas, such as in certain unconventional shale gas and oil reservoirs located in certain basins in the U.S., Canada, and certain other international markets. North American onshore rig counts increased during 2018 compared to the prior year. The Water & Flowback Services Division's revenues increased by $131.5 million in 2018 compared to 2017, due to increased activity in certain domestic and international markets and due to the impact of acquired water management services businesses, particularly from the February 28, 2018 acquisition of SwiftWater. Onshore U.S. activity levels in certain markets have reflected increased rig counts compared to the prior year, although customer demand for services during the fourth quarter of 2018 has been reduced due to the recent decline in oil prices.\nOur Compression Division, through CCLP, generates revenues and cash flows by providing compression services and equipment for natural gas and oil production, gathering, transportation, processing, and storage. The Compression Division's equipment sales business includes the fabrication and sale of standard compressor packages and custom-designed compressor packages designed and fabricated at the Compression Division's facilities. The Compression Division's aftermarket business provides a wide range of services including operation, maintenance, overhaul and reconfiguration services as well as the sale of compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers. The Compression Division provides its services and equipment to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, transmission, and storage companies operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States as well as in a number of foreign countries, including Mexico, Canada and Argentina. Compression Division revenues increased $143.1 million in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to a significant increase in revenues from sales of compressor equipment, as well as increased compression and related services revenues. The overall utilization of the Compression Division's compression fleet has improved sequentially for the past two years, reflecting increasing demand for compression services.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements. We prepared these financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, estimates, and judgments that affect the amounts reported. We base these estimates on historical experience, available information, and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. We periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those related to potential impairments of long-lived assets (including goodwill), the fair value of financial instruments (our outstanding stock warrants (the \"Warrants\") and CCLP Preferred Units), the collectability of accounts receivable, the current cost of future asset retirement obligations, the allocation of acquisition purchase price consideration and the fair value of contingent acquisition consideration. Note B - \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters. The fair values of portions of our total assets and liabilities are measured using significant unobservable inputs. The combination of these factors forms the basis for our judgments made about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. These judgments and estimates may change as new events occur, as new information is acquired, and as changes in our operating environments\nare encountered. Actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates, and those differences may be material. The following critical accounting policies reflect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nDuring 2016, we issued the Warrants and CCLP issued the CCLP Preferred Units as part of equity offerings to generate proceeds that were used to reduce long-term debt outstanding. The Warrants are accounted for as a derivative liability in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 815 \"Derivatives and Hedging\" and therefore they are classified as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet at their fair value. The CCLP Preferred Units may be settled using a variable number of common units, and therefore the fair value of the CCLP Preferred Units is classified as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with ASC 480 \"Distinguishing Liabilities and Equity.\" Changes in fair value of these financial instruments during each quarterly period are charged to earnings in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Warrants are valued using the Black Scholes option valuation model that includes estimates of the volatility of the Warrants based on their trading prices. The CCLP Preferred Units are valued using market information related to debt instruments, the trading price of the CCLP common units, and lattice modeling techniques. The fair values of the Warrants and the CCLP Preferred Units will generally increase or decrease with the trading price and volatility of our common stock and the CCLP common units, respectively. Increases (or decreases) in the fair value of these financial instruments will increase (decrease) the associated liability, resulting in future adjustments to earnings for the associated valuation losses (gains), and resulting in future volatility of our earnings during the period the financial instruments are outstanding. These estimates used in the calculated fair values of these financial instruments may not be accurate. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of the Warrants was $2.1 million, and the $11.1 million change in fair value during the year was credited to earnings during the period. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of the CCLP Preferred Units was $27.0 million, and the $0.7 million change in fair value during the year was credited to earnings during the period.\nAcquisition Purchase Price Allocations\nWe account for acquisitions of businesses using the purchase method, which requires the allocation of the purchase price consideration based on the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired. We estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired using accepted valuation methods, and, in many cases, such estimates are based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows expected to be generated from the acquired assets throughout their estimated useful lives. Following the February 28, 2018 acquisition of SwiftWater and the December 6, 2018 acquisition of JRGO, we have accounted for the various assets (including intangible assets) and liabilities acquired based on our estimate of their fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition purchase price consideration over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired. Our estimates and judgments of the fair value of acquired businesses are imprecise, and the use of inaccurate fair value estimates could result in the improper allocation of the acquisition purchase price consideration to acquired assets and liabilities, which could result in asset impairments, the recording of previously unrecorded liabilities, and other financial statement adjustments. The difficulty in estimating the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities is increased during periods of economic uncertainty.\nContingent Consideration\nAs part of the purchase of SwiftWater we may be required to pay additional contingent consideration, in an aggregate amount of up to $15.0 million, calculated on EBITDA and revenue of the combined water management business of SwiftWater and our pre-existing operations in the Permian Basin in respect of the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019. The contingent consideration may be paid in cash or shares of our common stock, at our election. The fair value of the contingent consideration is based on a probability simulation utilizing forecasted revenues and EBITDA of the water management business of SwiftWater and all of our pre-existing operations in the Permian Basin (a Level 3 fair value measurement). During the period from the closing date to December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value for the liabilities associated with the contingent purchase price consideration increased to $11.0 million, resulting in $3.4 million being charged to other (income) expense, net, during the year ended December 31, 2018. As part of the purchase of JRGO, we may be required to pay additional contingent consideration, in an aggregate amount of up to $1.5 million, during 2019 based on JRGO's performance during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe determination of impairment of long-lived assets, including identified intangible assets, is conducted periodically whenever indicators of impairment are present. If such indicators are present, the determination of the amount of impairment is based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives. If an impairment of a long-lived asset is warranted, we estimate the fair value of the asset based on a present value of these cash flows or the value that could be realized from disposing of the asset in a transaction between market participants. The oil and gas industry is cyclical, and our estimates of the amount of future cash flows, the period over which these estimated future cash flows will be generated, as well as the fair value of an impaired asset, are imprecise. Our failure to accurately estimate these future operating cash flows or fair values could result in certain long-lived assets being overstated, which could result in impairment charges in periods subsequent to the time in which the impairment indicators were first present. Alternatively, if our estimates of future operating cash flows or fair values are understated, impairments might be recognized unnecessarily or in excess of the appropriate amounts. During 2018, primarily as a result of the decreased expected future cash flows from a specific customer contract, we recorded consolidated impairments and other charges of $3.6 million. During periods of economic uncertainty, the likelihood of additional material impairments of long-lived assets is higher due to the possibility of decreased demand for our products and services.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nThe impairment of goodwill is also assessed whenever impairment indicators are present, but not less than once annually at a reporting unit level. We perform the annual test of goodwill impairment as of the last day of the fourth quarter of each year. As of December 31, 2018, consolidated goodwill consists of $25.9 million attributed to our Water Management reporting unit, included as part of our Water & Flowback Services Division. The first step of the impairment test is to compare the estimated fair value with the recorded net book value (including goodwill) of our reporting units. If the estimated fair value is higher than the recorded net book value, no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required. If, however, the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill to our estimated implied fair value of that goodwill. Our estimates of reporting unit fair value, when required, are based on a combination of an income and market approach. These estimates are imprecise and are subject to our estimates of the future cash flows of each business and our judgment as to how these estimated cash flows translate into each business' estimated fair value. These estimates and judgments are affected by numerous factors, including the general economic environment at the time of our assessment, which affects our overall market capitalization. If we overestimate the fair value of our reporting units, the balance of our goodwill asset may be overstated. Alternatively, if our estimated reporting unit fair values are understated, impairments might be recognized unnecessarily or in excess of the appropriate amounts.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, global oil prices decreased significantly. An accompanying decrease in our common stock price during the fourth quarter of 2018 has also indicated an overall reduction in our market capitalization. As part of our internal annual business outlook for each of our reporting units that we performed during the fourth quarter, we considered changes in the global economic environment that affected our stock price and market capitalization.\nAs part of the first step of goodwill impairment testing for our Water Management reporting unit (part of our Water & Flowback Services Division), the only reporting unit with goodwill as of December 31, 2018, we updated our assessment of the future cash flows, applying expected long-term growth rates, discount rates, and terminal values that we consider reasonable for the reporting unit. We calculated a present value of the cash flows for the Water Management reporting unit to arrive at an estimate of fair value using a combination of the income approach and market approach. Based on these assumptions, we determined that the fair value of the Water Management reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, which includes approximately $25.9 million of goodwill, by approximately 30%. Specific uncertainties affecting the estimated fair value of our Water Management reporting unit includes the impact of competition, prices of oil and natural gas, and future overall activity levels in the regions in which we operate, the activity levels of our significant customers, and other factors affecting the rate of future growth of this reporting unit. These factors will continue to be reviewed and assessed going forward. Negative developments with regard to these factors could have a further negative effect on the fair value of the Water Management reporting unit.\nThroughout 2016, lower oil and natural gas commodity prices resulted in a decreased demand for many of the products and services of each of our reporting units. Specifically to our Compression Division, which is one reporting unit, demand for low-horsepower wellhead compression services and for sales of compressor equipment decreased significantly. During the first quarter of 2016, as the market for services of CCLP continued to decline, the market capitalization of CCLP dropped significantly from December 31, 2015. Accordingly, the fair value, including the market capitalization for CCLP, for the Compression reporting unit was less than its carrying value as of March 31, 2016.\nOur Water & Flowback Services Division has two reporting units; Production Testing and Water Management. For our Production Testing reporting unit, market activity continued to decrease during the first quarter of 2016. As a result, the fair value of the Production Testing reporting unit was also less than its carrying value as of March 31, 2016.\nAfter making the hypothetical purchase price adjustments as part of the second step of the goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2016, we concluded that a full impairment of $92.3 million of remaining recorded goodwill for our Compression reporting unit and a full impairment of $13.9 million of the remaining recorded goodwill for our Production Testing reporting unit (included in our Water & Flowback Services Division) was required as of March 31, 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are a U.S. company and are subject to income taxes in the U.S. We also operate in a number of countries under many legal forms. Our operations are taxed on various bases, including actual income before taxes, deemed profits (which are generally determined using a percentage of revenue rather than profits) and withholding taxes based on revenue. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the applicable tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing, and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the applicable tax laws, and the sources and character of income and tax credits.\nWe provide for income taxes by taking into account the differences between the financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis amounts. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. Management must make certain assumptions regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary and must estimate the timing of their reversal, and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets.\nWe establish valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances, management has considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws, as well as changes in our financial condition, could affect these estimates.\nIn addition, we maintain liabilities for estimated tax exposures and uncertainties in jurisdictions where we operate. The annual tax provision includes the impact of income tax provisions and benefits for changes to liabilities that we consider appropriate, as well as related interest and penalties. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating income tax uncertainties. These factors include an evaluation of the technical merits of the tax position as well as the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement. The actual resolution of those uncertainties will inevitably differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. We believe that an appropriate liability has been established for the estimated exposures associated with these uncertainties under the guidance in ASC 740 Income Taxes.\u201d However, the actual resolution of those uncertainties will inevitably differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nThe following data

compared to the prior year due to increased revenues in our Compression and Water & Flowback Services Divisions. Compression Division revenues increased by $143.1 million driven by increased new compressor equipment sales activity and improved pricing. Our Water & Flowback Services Division revenues increased by $131.5 million due to increased activity in certain domestic and international markets and the February 28, 2018 acquisition of SwiftWater. See Divisional Comparisons section below for additional discussion.\nConsolidated gross profit increased during 2018 compared to the prior year due to the increased revenues of our Water & Flowback Services and Compression Divisions. The increased gross profit from these divisions more than offset the lower gross profit of our Completion Fluids & Products Division, which resulted from the mix of products and services compared to the prior year. Despite the improvement in activity levels of certain of our businesses, offshore activity levels remain flat and the impact of pricing pressures continues to challenge profitability in certain onshore markets. Operating expense levels reflect the increase in consolidated revenues, although we remain aggressive in managing operating costs and minimizing increased headcount.\nConsolidated general and administrative expenses increased during 2018 compared to the prior year, primarily due to $10.1 million of increased salary related expenses, $3.3 million of insurance and other general expenses, $2.7 million of increased professional services fees, and $0.9 million of increased bad debt and marketing expenses. Due to the increased consolidated revenues discussed above, general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues decreased compared to the prior year.\nConsolidated interest expense, net, increased in 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased Compression Division interest expense. Compression Division interest expense increased due to higher CCLP outstanding debt balances and a higher interest rate on the CCLP Senior Secured Notes, a portion of the proceeds of which were used to repay the balance outstanding under the CCLP Prior Credit Facility. Increased interest expense is expected to continue compared to prior years. Corporate interest expense also increased due to the Term Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement, which were entered into in September 2018 and replaced the 11% Senior Note and the previous bank credit agreement. Interest expense during 2018 and 2017 includes $4.3 million and $4.7 million, respectively, of finance cost amortization.\nThe Warrants are accounted for as a derivative liability in accordance with ASC 815 and therefore they are classified as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet at their fair value. Increases (or decreases) in the fair value of the Warrants are generally associated with increases (or decreases) in the trading price of our common stock, resulting in adjustments to earnings for the associated valuation losses (gains), and resulting in future volatility of our earnings during the period the Warrants are outstanding.\nThe CCLP Preferred Units may be settled using a variable number of CCLP common units, and therefore the fair value of the CCLP Preferred Units is classified as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with ASC 480. Because the CCLP Preferred Units are convertible into CCLP common units at the option of the holder, the fair value of the CCLP Preferred Units will generally increase or decrease with the trading price of the CCLP common units, and this increase (decrease) in CCLP Preferred Unit fair value will be charged (credited) to earnings, as appropriate, resulting in future volatility of our earnings during the period the CCLP Preferred Units are outstanding.\nIn January 2017, our Completion Fluids & Products Division collected $12.8 million from a successful legal arbitration award, resulting in a credit to earnings. See Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation section below for additional discussion.\nConsolidated other (income) expense, net, was $7.9 million of expense during 2018 compared to $0.9 million of expense during the prior year, primarily due to $3.4 million of increased expense associated with the remeasurement of the contingent purchase price consideration for SwiftWater and $3.5 million of increased expense related to the unamortized deferred financing costs charged to earnings as a result of the termination of the CCLP Prior Credit Facility. These increased expenses were partially offset by increased foreign currency gains.\nOur consolidated provisions for income taxes during 2018 was primarily attributable to taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions and Texas gross margin taxes. Our consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 of negative 17.3% was primarily the result of losses generated in entities for which no related tax benefit has been recorded. The losses generated by these entities do not result in tax benefits due to offsetting valuation allowances being recorded against the related net deferred tax assets. We establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Included in our deferred tax assets are net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that are available to offset future income tax liabilities in the U.S. as well as in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nWe applied the guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) when accounting for the enactment-date effects of the Act. During the 4th quarter of 2017, we recorded our best estimate of the impact of the Act in our year-end income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of the Act and guidance available and as a result recorded income tax expense of $54.1 million. This income tax expense was fully offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance previously recorded on our deferred tax assets. As such, the Act resulted in no net tax expense. As of December 31, 2018, we completed our accounting analysis for all of the enactment-date income tax effects and reduced our December 31, 2017 provisional amount by $2.5 million. The decrease in the income tax expense was fully offset by an increase in the valuation allowance. As such, the Act resulted in no net tax expense.\nIn January 2018, the FASB released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") provisions of the Act. The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. The guidance indicates that either accounting for deferred taxes related to GILTI inclusions or to treat any taxes on GILTI inclusions as period costs are both acceptable methods subject to an accounting policy election. As of December 31, 2017, we had not yet completed our assessment or elected an accounting policy to either recognize deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI\nor to record GILTI as period costs if and when incurred. After further consideration in 2018, we have elected to account for GILTI as a period cost in the year the tax is incurred. See \"Note H - Income Taxes\" contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the effect on our 2018 tax provision.\nDivisional Comparisons\nCompletion Fluids & Products Division\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period to Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands, Except Percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>257,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>257,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(443\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22,347\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(831\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(599\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(546\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Litigation arbitration award income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,816\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(179\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(518\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(33,268\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before taxes as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in Completion Fluids & Products Division revenues during 2018 compared to the prior year was due to $16.7 million of decreased service revenues, largely due to a reduction in completion services activity associated with a 2017 TETRA CS Neptune completion fluid project. This decrease was offset by $16.3 million of increased product sales revenue, attributed to increased manufactured products sales and international CBF product sales, partially offset by reduced CBF product sales revenues in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.\nCompletion Fluids & Products Division gross profit during 2018 decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to the profitability associated with the mix of CBF products and services, particularly for offshore completion fluids products. Completion Fluids & Products Division profitability in future periods will continue to be affected by the mix of its products and services, including the timing of TETRA CS Neptune completion fluid projects.\nThe Completion Fluids & Products Division reported a decrease in pretax earnings during 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to the reduction in gross profit discussed above and due to the collection of a successful legal arbitration award of $12.8 million during January 2017 that was credited to earnings. Completion Fluids & Products Division administrative cost levels decreased compared to the prior year, primarily due to $2.0 million of decreased salary and employee related expenses and $0.2 million of decreased insurance and other general expenses. These decreases were partially offset by $1.1 million of increased legal and professional fees and $0.3 million of increased bad debt expense. The Completion Fluids & Products Division continues to review opportunities to further reduce its administrative costs. The Division reported other income, net, during 2018 compared to other expense, net, during the prior year period primarily due to contract income recorded during the current year.\nWater & Flowback Services Division\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period to Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands, Except Percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>303,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,282.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(296\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(724\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,816\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>324.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before taxes as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWater & Flowback Services Division revenues increased during 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased water management services activity. Water management and flowback service revenues increased $142.1 million during 2018 compared to the prior year primarily resulting from the acquisition of SwiftWater and increased completion activity. We estimate that approximately $95.2 million of the water management services revenue increase was generated from the operations of SwiftWater, which was acquired on February 28, 2018. Product sales revenue decreased by $10.6 million, as there was an international equipment sale in the prior year. We continue to focus on expanding our Water & Flowback Services Division equipment asset fleet, particularly in selected markets, which is expected to generate increased revenues going forward.\nThe Water & Flowback Services Division reflected increased gross profit during 2018 compared to the prior year due to the increase in revenues and improving customer pricing levels. This improvement was also due to the impact of a $2.9 million long-lived asset impairment during 2018 compared to $14.9 million of long-lived asset impairments during 2017. Customer pricing continues to be challenging due to excess availability of equipment in certain markets. The Water & Flowback Services Division continues to monitor its cost structure, minimizing increased costs despite increasing activity levels.\nThe Water & Flowback Services Division reported pretax income compared to a pretax loss during the prior year, primarily due to the improvement in gross profit described above. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to SwiftWater operations, with increased wage and benefit expenses of $6.2 million, increased general expenses of $0.4 million, increased professional fees of $0.4 million, and $0.5 million of increased bad debt and consulting fees.

Demand for new compressor equipment continues to increase, and the current new equipment sales backlog has increased significantly compared to the prior year period. Cumulative new equipment sales orders added to our backlog during 2018 were $188 million. New equipment sales orders generally take less than 12 months to build and deliver. In addition, 2018 revenues reflect a $44.9 million increase in service revenues from compression and aftermarket services operations. This increase in service revenues was primarily due to increasing demand for compression services, as reflected by increased compression fleet utilization rates. Overall utilization of the Compression Division's compression fleet has improved sequentially for the past two years, led by increased utilization of the high- and medium-horsepower fleet.\nCompression Division gross profit increased during 2018 compared to the prior year due to increased revenues discussed above. The increased compression fleet utilization rates have led to increases in customer contract pricing.\nThe Compression Division recorded a decreased pretax loss during 2018 compared to the prior year due to increased gross profit as discussed above. Interest expense increased compared to the prior year due to higher outstanding CCLP debt balances and a higher interest rate on the CCLP Senior Secured Notes, issued in March 2018, when compared to the CCLP Prior Credit Facility. In addition, other (income) expense, net, reflected an increased expense primarily due to $3.5 million of unamortized deferred financing costs charged to earnings as a result of the termination of the CCLP Prior Credit Facility offset by foreign currency gains and decreased income associated with insurance proceeds from the prior year. In addition, the CCLP Preferred Units fair value adjustment resulted in a decreased credit to earnings in 2018 as compared to the prior year. Changes in the fair value of the CCLP Preferred Units may generate additional volatility to our earnings going forward. General and administrative expense levels increased compared to the prior year, due to increased salary and employee-related expenses, including equity compensation, of $5.3 million, increased other general expenses of $1.6 million, and increased sales and marketing expenses of $0.2 million. These increases were offset by decreased professional fees of $1.0 million.\nCorporate Overhead\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period to Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands, Except Percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit (loss) (primarily depreciation expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(658\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(84\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(574\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(683.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warrants fair value adjustment (income) expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,128\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,301\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,827\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(61,975\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(57,721\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,254\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCorporate Overhead pretax loss increased during 2018 compared to the prior year. Interest expense increased due to increased borrowings. Corporate general and administrative expense increased primarily due to $2.3 million of increased professional fees, including $0.9 million of transaction costs, $1.5 million of increased general expenses, and $0.6 million of salary and employee-related expenses. Interest expense increased due to increased borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement, which were entered into in September 2018 and replaced the 11% Senior Note and the previous bank credit agreement. Other expense, net also increased, primarily due to $1.0 million of debt issuance fees pursuant to the new ABL Credit Agreement and the new Term Credit Agreement. These increases in expense were offset by the fair value adjustment of the outstanding Warrants liability in the current year resulting in a $5.8 million increased credit to earnings compared to the

</tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated revenues for 2017 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to increased Water & Flowback Services revenues, which increased by $66.6 million, driven by increased onshore production testing and water management services activity. In addition, our Completion Fluids & Products Division also reported increased revenues compared to the prior year. Partially offsetting these increases, our Compression Division reported a $15.8 million decrease in revenues compared to the prior year, due to decreased demand for new compressor equipment in 2017 and pricing pressures for compression services, despite recent increases in compression fleet utilization. Challenging and competitive markets and activity levels continue to impact each of our businesses, although we continue to see indicators of improving demand for many of our products and services.\nConsolidated gross profit increased significantly during 2017 compared to the prior year due to increased revenues and activity, particularly for the Completion Fluids & Products Division. Despite the improving demand for many of our products and services, the impact of pricing pressures continued to challenge the profitability of each of our businesses. While we remain aggressive in managing operating costs and maintaining reduced headcount, the results of each of our businesses reflect the impact of company-wide reinstatements during the first half of 2017 reversing wage and benefit reductions that were implemented during the first half of 2016.\nConsolidated general and administrative expenses increased during 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to $10.7 million of increased salary related expenses and $2.2 million of insurance and other general expenses, partly offset by decreased professional services fees of $4.2 million and decreased bad debt and marketing expenses of $1.6 million. Due to the increased consolidated revenues discussed above, general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues decreased compared to the prior year.\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, we updated our test of goodwill impairment in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 350-20 \"Goodwill\" due to the decreases in the price of our common stock and the common unit price of CCLP. Continued decreased oil and natural gas prices had, and were expected to have, a continuing negative impact on industry drilling and capital expenditure activity, which affects the expected demand for products and services of each of our reporting units. Specifically, demand for our Compression Division's compression services and for sales of new compressor equipment had decreased significantly and was expected to continue to be decreased for the foreseeable future. Demand for our Water & Flowback Services Division's production testing services also had decreased as a result of decreased drilling and completion activity. This expected decreased demand, along with the decreases in the price of our common stock and the common unit price of CCLP, also caused an overall reduction in the fair values of each of our reporting units, particularly our Compression and Production Testing reporting units. As part of the test of goodwill impairment, we estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units, and determined, based on these estimated values, that impairments of the remaining goodwill of our Compression and Production Testing reporting units were necessary, primarily due to the market factors discussed above. Accordingly, during the first quarter of 2016, we recorded total impairment charges of $106.2 million associated with the goodwill of these reporting units. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges during 2017.\nConsolidated interest expense, net, decreased in 2017 compared to the prior year primarily due to the decrease in Corporate interest expense, reflecting the decrease in long-term debt outstanding. Largely offsetting this decrease, Compression Division interest expense increased related to the paid in kind quarterly distributions on the CCLP Preferred Units. Interest expense during 2017 and 2016 includes $4.7 million and $4.1 million, respectively, of finance cost amortization.\nGain on sales of assets decreased during 2017 compared to the prior year primarily due to significant gains on sales of Water & Flowback Services Division assets during 2016.\nThe Warrants are accounted for as a derivative liability in accordance with ASC 815 and therefore they are classified as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet at their fair value. Increases (or decreases) in the fair value of the Warrants are generally associated with the increase (or decrease) in the trading price of our common stock, resulting in adjustments to earnings for the associated valuation losses (gains), and resulting in future volatility of our earnings during the period the Warrants are outstanding.\nThe CCLP Preferred Units may be settled using a variable number of CCLP common units, and therefore the fair value of the CCLP Preferred Units is classified as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with ASC 480. Because the CCLP Preferred Units are convertible into CCLP common units at the option of the holder, the fair value of the CCLP Preferred Units will generally increase or decrease with the trading\nprice of the CCLP common units, and this increase (decrease) in CCLP Preferred Unit fair value will be charged (credited) to earnings, resulting in future volatility of our earnings during the period the CCLP Preferred Units are outstanding.\nIn January 2017, our Completion Fluids & Products Division collected $12.8 million from a successful legal arbitration award, resulting in a credit to earnings. See Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation section below for additional discussion.\nConsolidated other (income) expense, net, was $0.9 million of expense during 2017 compared to $4.3 million of expense during 2016, with the improvement primarily due to $2.1 million of issuance costs from the CCLP Preferred Units which were issued during 2016, $1.8 million of unamortized deferred finance costs that were charged to earnings in 2016 as a result of the repayment of senior notes and senior secured notes, $1.0 million of decreased finance fees associated with warrants issued in 2016, $1.1 million of insurance recoveries and $0.9 million of increased foreign currency gains. Partially offsetting these decreases is $1.4 million of net gains on the extinguishment of certain CCLP 7.25% Senior Notes during 2016.\nOur consolidated provision for income taxes during 2017 was primarily attributable to taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions and Texas gross margin taxes. Our consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 of negative 1.7% was primarily the result of losses generated in entities for which no related tax benefit has been recorded. The losses generated by these entities do not result in tax benefits due to offsetting valuation allowances being recorded against the related net deferred tax assets. We establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Included in our deferred tax assets are net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that are available to offset future income tax liabilities in the U.S. as well as in certain foreign jurisdictions. Further, the effective tax rate during 2016 was negatively impacted by the nondeductible portion of our goodwill impairments recorded during the three month period ended March 31, 2016.\nThe Act was enacted on December 22, 2017, making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes included, but were not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. We calculated our best estimate of the impact of the Act in our year end 2017 income tax provision.

While offshore rig counts remain low, we have seen an increase in demand from our offshore customers. In addition, international offshore fluid sales and onshore manufactured product sales increased compared to the prior year. Service revenues increased $3.3 million, primarily due to increased offshore completion services associated with the U.S. Gulf of Mexico TETRA CS Neptune completion project.\nCompletion Fluids & Products Division gross profit during 2017 increased significantly compared to 2016 primarily due to the profitability associated with the mix of CBF products and services, particularly for offshore completion fluids products and increased revenues. Completion Fluids & Products Division profitability in future periods will continue to be affected by the mix of its products and services and the timing of TETRA CS Neptune completion projects.\nThe Completion Fluids & Products Division reported a significant increase in pretax earnings during 2017 compared to the prior year primarily due to the increased gross profit discussed above. In addition, pretax earnings also increased due to the collection of a successful legal arbitration award of $12.8 million during January 2017 that was credited to earnings. Completion Fluids & Products Division administrative cost levels decreased compared to 2016, primarily due to $3.7 million of decreased legal and professional fees, following the legal arbitration award. In addition, bad debt and consulting expenses decreased by $0.1 million. These decreases were partially offset by $0.8 million of increased wage and benefit related expenses. The Division reported other expense, net, during 2017 compared to other income, net, during the prior year period primarily due to increased foreign currency losses compared to the prior year.\nWater & Flowback Services Division\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period to Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands, Except Percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,586\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(114.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit (loss) as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,871\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(296\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(594\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(724\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,863\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,816\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(42,783\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before taxes as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWater & Flowback Services Division revenues increased during 2017 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased service revenues of $54.1 million during 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting increased water management services activity resulting from the impact of increased demand, reflecting the growth in domestic onshore rig count and activity in certain domestic and international markets. Onshore U.S. activity levels in certain markets, particularly the Permian Basin of Texas, have reflected the increased rig counts during the last half of 2017 compared to the prior year, although customer pricing levels in certain markets continue to be challenging due to excess availability of equipment. Water & Flowback Services revenues also increased during 2017 due to $12.4 million of product sales revenues associated with international equipment sales.\nThe Water & Flowback Services Division reported an increased gross profit during 2017 compared to a gross loss during 2016 due to the international equipment sales discussed above as well as due to the increased industry activity levels. This improvement was despite $14.9 million of long-lived asset impairments during 2017 compared to $6.4 million of long-lived asset impairments during the prior year.\nThe Water & Flowback Services Division reported a decreased pretax loss compared to the prior year, primarily due to the gross profit discussed above and due to a goodwill impairment recorded during the prior year.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased general expenses and increased salary and benefit expenses. Other income, net decreased primarily due to decreased foreign currency gains and decreased gains on disposal of assets.\nCompression Division\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period to Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands, Except Percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>295,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>311,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15,787\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,567\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,757\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92,334\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CCLP Series A Preferred fair value adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,975\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,011\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(189\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(37,246\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(136,327\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before taxes as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCompression Division revenues decreased during 2017 compared to 2016 due to reductions in both compression and related services revenues and new compressor equipment sales revenues. The $10.7 million decrease in compression and related service revenues resulted primarily from the reduction in pricing for compression services, and was realized despite increased overall compression fleet utilization. Although overall utilization of the Compression Division's compression fleet has improved sequentially for five consecutive quarterly periods, demand for low-horsepower production enhancement compression services remains challenged. Revenues from sales of compressor equipment and parts during 2017 decreased $5.1 million compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased sales of new compressor equipment.\nCompression Division gross profit decreased during 2017 compared to the prior year despite a $2.4 million insurance recovery in 2017 for equipment that was damaged in the prior year, and despite $10.2 million in impairments and other charges recorded during the prior year period. This decrease in gross profit was primarily due to compression services customer pricing pressures discussed above. Although some customer pricing still remains lower than early 2016 levels, pricing pressures have been easing, and pricing for compression services is expected to continue to improve going forward.\nThe Compression Division recorded a decreased pretax loss during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the impact of goodwill impairment recorded during the prior year. In addition, the fair value adjustment of the CCLP Preferred Units was credited to earnings during 2017 compared to a charge to earnings in the prior year. Changes in the fair value of the CCLP Preferred Units may generate additional volatility to our earnings going forward. Also, general and administrative expense levels decreased compared to the prior year, mainly due to decreased professional fees of $1.0 million, decreased bad debt expense of $0.7 million, decreased salary related expenses of $0.5 million and decreased other expenses of $0.3 million. The Compression Division recorded other income, net, during 2017 compared to other expense, net, during the prior year due to $2.1 million of CCLP Preferred Units issuance costs that were expensed during the prior year, and due to $0.6 million of insurance recoveries credited to other income during 2017. These decreased expenses were partially offset by the decreased gross profit discussed above, and due to increased interest expense, net, compared to the prior year due to the expense associated with paid in kind quarterly distributions on the CCLP Preferred Units that were issued during the third quarter of 2016.\nCorporate Overhead\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period to Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands, Except Percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit (loss) (primarily depreciation expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(84\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(430\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,080\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warrants fair value adjustment (income) expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,301\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,407\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,768\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(57,721\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(62,933\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCorporate Overhead pretax loss decreased during 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the adjustment of the fair value of the outstanding Warrants liability that resulted in a $5.3 million credit to earnings during 2017 compared to a charge to earnings during 2016. In addition, interest expense, net, during 2017 decreased compared to the prior year reflecting the reduction in outstanding long-term debt following the June and December 2016 equity offerings, the proceeds from which were primarily used to retire long-term debt outstanding. In addition, other expense, net, decreased primarily due to $1.8 million of unamortized deferred finance costs that were charged to earnings pursuant to the repayment of senior notes and senior secured notes in the prior year. Corporate general and administrative expense increased primarily due to $9.8 million of increased salary, incentives and employee related expense, $1.9 million of increased general expenses, and $0.4 million of increased professional fees. The increased salary, incentives and employee related expenses include the impact of company-wide wage and salary reinstatements during the first half of 2017 and the discontinuation of the workweek reductions that were implemented during the first half of 2016, as well as the impact of severance expense during 2017. These increases were partially offset by $0.8 million of decreased consulting marketing fees.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe reported decreased consolidated cash flows provided by operating activities during 2018 compared to the prior year. This decrease occurred despite improved profitability of our operations, due to increased working capital needs largely due to the timing of payments of accounts payable. We generated $46.6 million of consolidated operating cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2018, with CCLP providing $30.1 million of this consolidated total. We received $12.1 million of cash distributions from CCLP during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $14.2 million during the prior year. The amount of distributions we receive from CCLP is expected to decrease further in 2019, following CCLP's announcement in December 2018 of a significant reduction in distributions to its common unitholders, including us. As a result of the acquisition of SwiftWater, our operating cash flows increased during 2018, and such increase more than offset the decrease in operating cash flows following the March 2018 disposal of our Offshore Division. We believe that the capital restructuring steps we have taken during the past three years support our ability to meet our financial obligations and fund future growth as needed, despite current uncertain operating and financial markets.\nWe and CCLP are in compliance with all covenants of our respective debt agreements as of December 31, 2018. We have reviewed our financial forecasts for the twelve month period subsequent to March 4, 2019, which consider our debt covenant requirements. Based on our financial forecasts, which are based on current market conditions and certain operating and other business assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of March 4, 2019, we believe that we will have adequate liquidity, earnings, and operating cash flows to fund our operations and debt obligations and maintain compliance with our debt covenants through at least the next twelve months. With regard to CCLP, also considering financial forecasts based on current market conditions as of March 4, 2019, CCLP believes that it will have adequate liquidity, earnings, and operating cash flows to fund its operations and debt obligations and maintain compliance with the covenants under its long-term debt agreements through at least the next twelve months.\nOur consolidated sources and uses of cash during the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 are as follows:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(188,646\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47,897\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,295\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>154,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,336\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,633\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause of the level of our consolidated debt, we believe it is important to consider our capital structure and CCLP's capital structure separately, as there are no cross default provisions, cross collateralization provisions, or cross guarantees between CCLP's debt and TETRA's debt. (See Financing Activities section below for a complete discussion of the terms of our and CCLP's respective debt arrangements.) Our consolidated debt outstanding has a carrying value of approximately $815.6 million as of December 31, 2018. However, approximately $633.0 million of this consolidated debt balance is owed by CCLP and is serviced from the cash balances and cash flows of CCLP, $343.2 million of which is secured by certain of CCLP's assets. Through our approximately 35% common unit ownership interest in CCLP and ownership of an approximately 1% general partner interest, we receive our share of the distributable cash flows of CCLP through its quarterly cash distributions. Approximately $15.9 million of the $40.0 million of the cash balance reflected on our consolidated balance sheet is owned by CCLP and is not available to us. In September 2018, we entered into the ABL Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement. In connection with the closing of these debt agreements, we used a portion of the proceeds to repay all outstanding borrowings and obligations under our then existing bank credit agreement and all outstanding indebtedness under the 11% Senior Note, and both the bank credit agreement and the note purchase agreement for the 11% Senior Note were then terminated. As of December 31, 2018, subject to compliance with the covenants, borrowing base requirements, and other provisions of the agreement that may limit borrowings, we had availability of approximately $47.6 million under the ABL Credit Agreement. Following the March 2018 issuance of the CCLP Senior Secured Notes, CCLP used a portion of the proceeds to repay the outstanding borrowings under the CCLP Prior Credit Facility, which was then terminated. In June 2018, CCLP entered into the CCLP Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, and subject to compliance with the covenants, borrowing base requirements, and other provisions of the agreement that may limit borrowings under the CCLP Credit Agreement, CCLP had availability of $27.1 million. See CCLP Financing Activities below for further discussion.\nOperating Activities\nConsolidated cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $46.6 million during 2018 compared to $64.6 million during the prior year, a decrease of $18.0 million. Operating cash flows decreased despite improved operating profitability due to the use of cash for working capital changes, particularly related to the timing of payments of accounts payable. We have taken steps to aggressively manage working capital, including increased collection efforts. We continue to monitor customer credit risk and have historically focused on serving larger capitalized oil and gas operators and national oil companies. Cash utilized for increased inventory primarily relates to work in progress inventory for new compressor package sales by our Compression Division, and this increase was largely offset by advance funding by its customers.\nDemand for the vast majority of our products and services is driven by oil and gas industry activity, which is affected by oil and natural gas pricing. With the increase in oil prices in early 2018, operating plans and capital expenditure levels of many of our oil and natural gas customers increased, benefiting certain of our operating segments with improved revenues and cash flows. The acquisition of SwiftWater provided additional revenues and operating cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2018, and, along with the acquisition of JRGO in December 2018, is expected to continue to do so going forward. Growth in completion activity compared to early 2017 has resulted in improved cash provided by operating activities of our Water & Flowback Services Division. The increased capital expenditure activity of our Compression Division customers has resulted in increased demand for compression services and equipment, and related increased revenues. The improved 2018 results were realized despite the impact of decreased oil commodity prices that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2018. We are monitoring the 2019 spending plans of our customers as a result of the current reduced oil prices, and if oil prices decrease further during 2019, demand for many of our products and services, and our associated operating cash\nflows, could be negatively impacted. During early 2018, and despite increasing activity levels, our goal was to minimize growth to our operating and administrative headcount and continue to maintain a low cost structure for our businesses, particularly during the current period of volatile oil and natural gas prices.\nAs part of the sale of our Offshore Division in March 2018, Orinoco Natural Resources, LLC (\"Orinoco\") assumed all liabilities and obligations currently associated with our former Maritech subsidiary, including but not limited to all current and future decommissioning obligations related to properties owned or formerly owned by our Maritech subsidiary prior to its purchase by Orinoco.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring 2018, the total amount of our net cash utilized on investing activities was $188.6 million. Total cash capital expenditures during 2018 were $141.9 million, which is net of $10.1 million cost of equipment sold. Our Completion Fluids & Products Division spent $5.3 million on capital expenditures during 2018, the majority of which related to plant and facility additions. Our Water & Flowback Services Division spent $30.2 million on capital expenditures, primarily to add to its water management equipment fleet. Our Compression Division spent $114.0 million, primarily for growth capital expenditure projects to increase its compression fleet. The acquisition of SwiftWater included initial cash purchase price consideration of $42.0 million, plus $1.0 million which was subsequently paid in August 2018 as a working capital adjustment. The acquisition of JRGO included initial cash purchase price consideration of $7.6 million.\nGenerally, a significant majority of our planned capital expenditures has been related to identified opportunities to grow and expand our existing businesses. However, certain of these planned expenditures have been, and may continue to be, postponed or canceled as we are reviewing all capital expenditure plans carefully in an effort to conserve cash. We currently have no long-term capital expenditure commitments. The deferral of capital projects could affect our ability to compete in the future. Excluding our Compression Division, we expect to spend approximately $25 to $35 million during 2019, primarily to further expand the Water & Flowback Services Division equipment fleet. Our Compression Division expects to spend approximately $75 million to $80 million on capital expenditures during 2019, primarily to expand its compression fleet in response to increased demand for compression services. Growth capital expenditures by our Compression Division during 2019 are expected to be funded by CCLP's available cash, cash provided by operating activities, and a portion funded by TETRA. The level of future growth capital expenditures depends on forecasted demand for our products and services. If the forecasted demand for our products and services during 2019 increases or decreases, the amount of planned expenditures on growth and expansion may be adjusted accordingly.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring 2018, the total amount of consolidated cash provided by financing activities was $155.0 million, consisting primarily of the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. In September 2018, we entered into the ABL Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement, a portion of the proceeds of which were used to repay all outstanding borrowings and obligations under our then existing bank credit agreement and all outstanding indebtedness under the 11% Senior Note and both the bank credit agreement and the note purchase agreement for the 11% Senior Note were then terminated. Borrowings of up to $100 million under the ABL Credit Agreement, and up to $75 million of additional borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement will be available, subject to their availability, to fund future working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements as well as potential acquisition financing. In March 2018, CCLP issued the CCLP Senior Secured Notes, a portion of the proceeds of which were used to repay the outstanding balance under the CCLP Prior Credit Facility and provide funding for 2018 capital expenditures. In June 2018, CCLP entered into the CCLP Credit Agreement, which provides up to $50.0 million to fund ongoing working capital and letter of credit needs and for general business purposes of CCLP. We and CCLP may supplement our existing cash balances and cash flow from operating activities with short-term borrowings, long-term borrowings, leases, issuances of equity and debt securities, and other sources of capital, subject to availability. During December 2018, CCLP decided to begin redeeming a portion of the CCLP Preferred Units using cash, rather than converting using CCLP common units, beginning with the January 2019 conversion date. We and CCLP are in compliance with all covenants of our respective credit and debt agreements as of December 31, 2018.\nSee CCLP Financing Activities below for discussion of the CCLP Preferred Units and CCLP's long-term debt.\nTETRA Long-Term Debt\nAsset-Based Credit Agreement. On September 10, 2018, TETRA, as borrower, and certain of its subsidiaries, entered into the ABL Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (collectively, the \"ABL Lenders\"). The ABL Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to $100 million, subject to a borrowing base to be determined by reference to the value of inventory and accounts receivable, and includes a sublimit of $20.0 million for letters of credit and a swingline loan sublimit of $10.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, subject to compliance with the covenants, borrowing base, and other provisions of the agreement that may limit borrowings, TETRA had an availability of $47.6 million under this agreement. As of March 1, 2019, we have $32.0 million outstanding under our ABL Credit Agreement and $9.0 million letters of credit.\nBorrowings under the ABL Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TETRA, either (i) London Interbank Offering Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) plus a margin based upon a fixed charge coverage ratio or (ii) a base rate plus a margin based on a fixed charge coverage ratio. The base rate is determined by reference to the highest of (a) the prime rate of interest as announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) plus 0.5% per annum and (c) LIBOR (adjusted to reflect any required bank reserves) for a one-month period on such day plus 1.0% per annum. Borrowings outstanding have an applicable margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.25% per annum for LIBOR-based loans and 0.75% to 1.25% per annum for base-rate loans, based upon the applicable fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the ABL Credit Agreement, TETRA is required to pay certain fees.\nThe revolving loans under the ABL Credit Agreement may be voluntarily prepaid, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, subject to applicable breakage fees. The maturity date of the ABL Facility is September 10, 2023.\nThe ABL Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of TETRA and certain of its subsidiaries to take certain actions including, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, incurring debt, granting liens, engaging in mergers and other fundamental changes, making investments, entering into or amending transactions with affiliates, paying dividends and making other restricted payments, prepaying other indebtedness, and selling assets. The ABL Credit Agreement also contains a provision that requires a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.00 to 1.00 in the event that certain conditions associated with outstanding borrowings and cash availability occur. As of December 31, 2018, such conditions have not occurred. All obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement and the guarantees of those obligations are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by a security interest on substantially all of the personal property of TETRA and certain subsidiaries of TETRA, the equity interests in certain domestic subsidiaries, including CCLP, and a maximum of 65% of the equity interests in certain foreign subsidiaries.\nThe ABL Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations or warranties, cross-default to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, invalidity or impairment of security interests or invalidity of loan documents, certain ERISA events, unsatisfied or unstayed judgments, and any change of control.\nProceeds of loans under the ABL Credit Agreement were used to pay certain debt of TETRA existing on the effective date of the ABL Credit Agreement and may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The ABL Credit Agreement replaced our previous Bank Credit Agreement, as defined and discussed in further detail below.\nTerm Credit Agreement. On September 10, 2018, TETRA, as borrower, entered into the Term Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders (collectively, the Term Lenders\u201d) and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as administrative agent. The Term Credit Agreement provides an initial loan in the amount of $200 million (the Initial Term Loan\u201d) and the availability of additional loans, subject to the terms of the Term Credit Agreement, up to an aggregate amount of $75 million for certain acquisitions (the Additional Term Loans,\u201d and together with the\nInitial Term Loan, the Term Loan\u201d). As of March 1, 2019, $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our Term Credit Agreement is outstanding.\nBorrowings under the Term Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TETRA, either (i) LIBOR plus a margin of 6.25% per annum or (ii) a base rate plus a margin of 5.25% per annum. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the Term Credit Agreement, TETRA is required to pay a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments at the rate of 1.0% per annum, paid quarterly in arrears based on utilization of the commitments under the Term Credit Agreement.\nThe Term Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of TETRA and certain of its subsidiaries to take certain actions including, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, incurring debt, granting liens, engaging in mergers and other fundamental changes, making investments, entering into or amending transactions with affiliates, paying dividends and making other restricted payments, prepaying other indebtedness, and selling assets. The Term Credit Agreement also contains a requirement that the borrowers comply at the end of each fiscal quarter with a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Term Credit Agreement) of 1.00 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2018, TETRA is in compliance with the Interest Coverage Ratio requirement.\nAll obligations under the Term Credit Agreement and the guarantees of those obligations are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by a security interest for the benefit of the Term Lenders on substantially all of the personal property of TETRA and certain of its subsidiaries, the equity interests in certain domestic subsidiaries, including CCLP, and a maximum of 65% of the equity interests in certain foreign subsidiaries.\nThe Term Credit Agreement includes customary events of default including non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations or warranties, cross-default to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, invalidity or impairment of security interests or invalidity of loan documents, certain ERISA events, unsatisfied or unstayed judgments, and any change of control.\nThe net proceeds from the Initial Term Loan were used to prepay outstanding indebtedness under the 11% Senior Note and indebtedness of TETRA under our then existing bank credit agreement discussed below. Proceeds of any Additional Term Loans may be used for acquisitions, subject to the terms of the Term Credit Agreement. The loans under the Term Credit Agreement may be voluntarily prepaid, in whole or in part, subject to applicable breakage fees. Any prepayment prior to the one-year anniversary is also subject to a make-whole\u201d payment as set forth in the Term Credit Agreement. Thereafter, any prepayment during the period commencing after the one-year anniversary and ending on the two-year anniversary will have a premium of 3.0% and during the period commencing after the two-year anniversary and ending on the three-year anniversary, a premium of 1.0%. The maturity date of the Term Credit Agreement is September 10, 2025. There is no prepayment premium required after the third anniversary.\nPrior Bank Credit Agreement. On September 10, 2018, in connection with the closing of the above-described loans, TETRA repaid all outstanding borrowings and obligations under our then existing bank credit agreement with a portion of the net proceeds from the above-described loans and terminated the existing bank credit agreement. Certain of the ABL Lenders were lenders under the then existing bank credit agreement and, accordingly, received a portion of the proceeds from the above-described loans in connection with the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under the then existing bank credit agreement.\n11% Senior Note. On September 10, 2018, in connection with the closing of the above-described loans, TETRA repaid all outstanding indebtedness under the 11% Senior Note with a portion of the proceeds from the above-described loans and terminated its obligations under the 11% Senior Note. Affiliates of certain Term Lenders were holders of the 11% Senior Note and, accordingly, received a portion of the proceeds from the Term Credit Agreement in connection with the repayment of the outstanding indebtedness under the 11% Senior Note. In connection with the early termination of the 11% Senior Note, TETRA paid $7 million of \"make-whole\" prepayment fee in accordance with the terms of the 11% Senior Note.\nCCLP Financing Activities\nIn March 2018, CCLP issued an aggregate $350.0 million of its CCLP Senior Secured Notes, and the net proceeds of $342.5 million were partially used to repay the remaining outstanding balance of $258.0 million under the CCLP Prior Credit Facility, which was then terminated. See below for a further discussion of the CCLP Senior Secured Notes. The remaining proceeds are being used to fund CCLP capital expenditures, as well as for general partnership needs.\nCCLP Preferred Units. During 2016, CCLP issued an aggregate of 6,999,126 of CCLP Preferred Units for a cash purchase price of $11.43 per CCLP Preferred Unit (the Issue Price\u201d), resulting in total 2016 net proceeds of approximately $77.3 million. We purchased 874,891 of the CCLP Preferred Units at the aggregate Issue Price of $10.0 million.\nIn connection with the closing of the Initial Private Placement, CSI Compressco GP Inc (our wholly owned subsidiary) executed the Second Amended and Restated CCLP Partnership Agreement to, among other things, authorize and establish the rights and preferences of the CCLP Preferred Units. The CCLP Preferred Units are a new class of equity security that rank senior to all classes or series of equity securities of CCLP with respect to distribution rights and rights upon liquidation. We and the other holders of CCLP Preferred Units (each, a CCLP Preferred Unitholder\u201d) receive quarterly distributions, which are paid in kind in additional CCLP Preferred Units, equal to an annual rate of 11.00% of the Issue Price ($1.2573 per unit annualized) of the outstanding CCLP Preferred Units, subject to certain adjustments. The rights of the CCLP Preferred Units include certain anti-dilution adjustments, including adjustments for economic dilution resulting from the issuance of common units in the future below a set price.\nUnless otherwise redeemed for cash, a ratable portion of the CCLP Preferred Units has been, and will be, converted into CCLP common units on the eighth day of each month over a period of thirty months that began in March 2017 (each, a Conversion Date\u201d), subject to certain provisions of the Second Amended and Restated CCLP Partnership Agreement that may delay or accelerate all or a portion of such monthly conversions. On each Conversion Date, a portion of the CCLP Preferred Units will convert into, at CCLP's election, cash or CCLP common units representing limited partner interests in CCLP in an amount equal to, with respect to each CCLP Preferred Unitholder, the number of CCLP Preferred Units held by such CCLP Preferred Unitholder divided by the number of Conversion Dates remaining, subject to adjustment described in the Second Amended and Restated CCLP Partnership Agreement, with the conversion price (the \"Conversion Price\") determined by the trading prices of the common units over the prior month, among other factors, and as otherwise impacted by the existence of certain conditions related to the CCLP common units. The maximum aggregate number of CCLP common units that could be required to be issued pursuant to the conversion provisions of the CCLP Preferred Units is potentially unlimited; however, CCLP may, at its option, pay cash, or a combination of cash and CCLP common units, to the CCLP Preferred Unitholders instead of issuing CCLP common units on any Conversion Date, subject to certain restrictions as described in the Second Amended and Restated CCLP Partnership Agreement and the CCLP Credit Agreement (defined below). On December 20, 2018, CCLP announced that, given the decline in its common unit price, CCLP was reducing its common unit distributions from $0.75 per unit per year (or $0.1875 per quarter) to $0.04 per unit per year (or $0.01 per quarter) for a period of up to four quarters, beginning with the fourth quarter of 2018 distribution. Beginning with the January 2019 conversion date, CCLP intends to use the approximately $34 million of savings from the reduced distribution to redeem the remaining CCLP Preferred Units for cash and avoid the dilution to CCLP's common unitholders that would occur if the remaining CCLP Preferred Units were converted into CCLP common units.\nIncluding the impact of paid in kind distributions of CCLP Preferred Units and previous conversions of CCLP Preferred Units into CCLP common units, the total number of CCLP Preferred Units outstanding as of December 31, 2018 was 2,732,981, of which we held 343,232.\nBecause the CCLP Preferred Units may be settled using a variable number of CCLP common units, the fair value of the CCLP Preferred Units is classified as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with ASC 480 \"Distinguishing Liabilities and Equity.\" The fair value of the CCLP Preferred Units as of December 31, 2018 was $30.9 million. Changes in the fair value during each quarterly period, if any, are charged or credited to earnings in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Charges or credits to earnings for changes in the fair value of the CCLP Preferred Units, along with the interest expense for the accrual and payment of paid-in-kind distributions associated with the CCLP Preferred Units, are non-cash charges and credits associated with the CCLP Preferred Units.\nCCLP Bank Credit Facility. On June 29, 2018, CCLP and two of its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively the \"CCLP Borrowers\"), and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries named therein as guarantors (the \"CCLP Credit Agreement Guarantors\"), entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the \"CCLP Credit Agreement\") with the lenders thereto (the \"Lenders\"), and Bank of America, N.A., in its capacity as administrative agent, collateral agent, letter of credit issuer, and swing line lender. All of the CCLP Borrowers' obligations under the CCLP Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of their existing and future domestic subsidiaries. The CCLP Credit Agreement includes a maximum credit commitment of $50.0 million which is available for loans, letters of credit (with a sublimit of $25.0 million), and swingline loans (with a sublimit of $5.0 million), subject to a borrowing base determined by reference to the value of CCLP's and any other borrowers' accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2018, and subject to compliance with the covenants, borrowing base, and other provisions of the agreements that may limit borrowings under the CCLP Credit Agreement, CCLP had availability of $27.1 million. Such maximum credit commitment may be increased by $25.0 million in accordance with the terms and conditions of the CCLP Credit Agreement.\nThe CCLP Borrowers may borrow funds under the CCLP Credit Agreement to pay fees and expenses related to the CCLP Credit Agreement and for the Borrowers' ongoing working capital needs and for general partnership purposes. The revolving loans under the CCLP Credit Agreement may be voluntarily prepaid, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, subject to breakage or similar costs. The maturity date of the CCLP Credit Agreement is June 29, 2023. As of December 31, 2018, no balance was outstanding under the CCLP Credit Agreement. As of March 1, 2019, CCLP has no balance outstanding under the CCLP Credit Agreement and $3.5 million letters of credit.\nBorrowings under the CCLP Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of the CCLP Borrowers, either (i) LIBOR plus a margin based on average daily excess availability or (ii) a base rate plus a margin based on average daily excess availability. LIBOR-based loans will have an applicable margin ranging between 1.75% and 2.25% per annum and base-rate loans will have an applicable margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.25% per annum, according to average daily excess availability when financial statements are delivered. In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the CCLP Credit Agreement, the CCLP Borrowers are required to pay certain fees.\nThe CCLP Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of the CCLP Borrowers, the CCLP Credit Agreement Guarantors, and certain of their subsidiaries to take certain actions including, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, incurring debt, granting liens, making investments, entering into or amending transactions with affiliates, paying dividends, and selling assets. The CCLP Credit Agreement also contains a provision that requires compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the CCLP Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 in the event that certain conditions associated with outstanding borrowings and cash availability occur. As of December 31, 2018, such conditions have not occurred.\nAll obligations under the CCLP Credit Agreement and the guarantees of those obligations are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by a first priority security interest for the benefit of the Lenders in the CCLP Borrowers' and the CCLP Credit Agreement Guarantors' present and future accounts receivable, inventories and related assets, and proceeds of the foregoing.\nCCLP Senior Secured Notes. The obligations under the CCLP Senior Secured Notes are jointly and severally, and fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of our domestic restricted subsidiaries (other than CSI Compressco Finance) that guarantee its other indebtedness (the \"CCLP Senior Secured Notes Guarantors\" and together with CCLP and CSI Compressco Finance Inc, the \"CCLP Senior Secured Notes Obligors\"). The CCLP Senior Secured Notes and the subsidiary guarantees thereof (together, the \"CCLP Senior Secured Notes Securities\") were issued pursuant to an indenture described below. As of March 1, 2019, $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the CCLP Senior Secured Notes are outstanding. The CCLP Senior Secured Notes Securities are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of CCLP Senior Secured Notes Obligors' assets (the \"Collateral\"), subject to certain permitted encumbrances and exceptions.\nThe CCLP Senior Secured Notes accrue interest at a rate of 7.50% per annum. Interest on the CCLP Senior Secured Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The CCLP Senior Secured Notes are scheduled to mature on April 1, 2025.\nThe CCLP Senior Secured Notes Indenture contains customary covenants restricting CCLP's ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to: (i) pay distributions on, purchase, or redeem CCLP common units or purchase or redeem any subordinated debt; (ii) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain kinds of preferred equity securities; (iii) create or incur certain liens securing indebtedness; (iv) sell assets, including dispositions of the Collateral; (v) consolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of CCLP's assets; (vi) enter into transactions with affiliates; and (vii) enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from CCLP's restricted subsidiaries to CCLP. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions, including certain provisions permitting CCLP, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to transfer assets to certain of its unrestricted subsidiaries. Moreover, if the CCLP Senior Secured Notes receive an investment grade rating from at least two rating agencies and no default has occurred and is continuing under the CCLP Senior Secured Notes indenture, many of the restrictive covenants in the CCLP Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be terminated. The CCLP Senior Secured Notes Indenture also contains customary events of default and acceleration provisions relating to events of default, which provide that upon an event of default under the CCLP Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding CCLP Senior Secured Notes may declare all of the CCLP Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable immediately. CCLP is in compliance with all covenants of the CCLP Senior Secured Notes Indenture as of December 31, 2018.\nCCLP Senior Notes. The obligations under the CCLP 7.25% Senior Notes (the \"CCLP Senior Notes\") are jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally, guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of CCLP's domestic restricted subsidiaries (other than CSI Compressco Finance) that guarantee CCLP's other indebtedness (the \"Guarantors\" and together with the Issuers, the \"Obligors\"). The CCLP Senior Notes and the subsidiary guarantees thereof (together, the \"CCLP Senior Note Securities\") were issued pursuant to an indenture described below. As of March 1, 2019, $295.9 million in aggregate principal amount of the CCLP Senior Notes are outstanding.\nThe Obligors issued the CCLP Senior Note Securities pursuant to the Indenture dated as of August 4, 2014 (the \"CCLP Senior Notes Indenture\") by and among the Obligors and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the \"Trustee\"). The CCLP Senior Notes accrue interest at a rate of 7.25% per annum. Interest on the CCLP Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The CCLP Senior Notes are scheduled to mature on August 15, 2022.\nThe CCLP Senior Notes Indenture contains customary covenants restricting CCLP's ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to: (i) pay dividends and make certain distributions, investments and other restricted payments; (ii) incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares; (iii) create certain liens; (iv) sell assets; (v) merge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets; (vi) enter into transactions with affiliates; and (vii) designate its subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries under the CCLP Senior Notes Indenture. The CCLP Senior Notes Indenture also contains customary events of default and acceleration provisions relating to such events of default, which provide that upon an event of default under the CCLP Senior Notes Indenture, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the CCLP Senior Notes then outstanding may declare all amounts owing under the CCLP Senior Notes to be due and payable. CCLP is in compliance with all covenants of the CCLP Senior Note Purchase Agreement as of December 31, 2018.\nOther Sources and Uses\nIn addition to the aforementioned credit facilities and senior notes, we and CCLP fund our respective short-term liquidity requirements from cash generated by our respective operations, leases, and from short-term vendor financing. Should additional capital be required, we believe that we have the ability to raise such capital through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities. However, instability or volatility in the capital markets at the times we need to access capital may affect the cost of capital and the ability to raise capital for an indeterminable length of time.\nTETRA's ABL Credit Agreement, matures in September 2023, TETRA's Term Credit Agreement matures in September 2025, the CCLP Senior Notes mature in August 2022, the CCLP Senior Secured Notes mature in April 2025, and the CCLP Credit Agreement matures in June 2023. The replacement of these capital sources on similar or more favorable terms is not certain. If it is necessary to issue additional equity to fund our capital needs, additional dilution to our common stockholders will occur.\nAlthough near-term growth plans pursuant to our long-term growth strategy have resumed, they are being reviewed carefully and are subject to our continuing efforts to conserve cash. CCLP has also increased its growth capital expenditure activity in response to increased demand for compression services. CCLP's long-term growth objectives are funded from its available cash, cash provided by operations, financing transactions with TETRA, other borrowings, and cash generated from the issuance of equity or debt securities.\nAs part of long-term strategic growth plans, we and CCLP evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses and assets. Such acquisitions may be funded with existing cash balances, borrowings under credit facilities, or cash generated from the issuance of equity or debt securities or the issuance of equity securities to the seller.\nThe Second Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement of CCLP requires that within 45 days after the end of each quarter, CCLP distribute all of its available cash, as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, to its unitholders of record on the applicable record date. During the year ended December 31, 2018, CCLP distributed approximately $31.3 million in cash, including approximately $19.2 million to its public unitholders. The amount of quarterly distributions is determined based on a variety of factors, including estimates of CCLP's cash needs to fund its future operating, investing, and debt service requirements. The amount of distributions we receive from CCLP is expected to decrease further in 2019, following CCLP's announcement in December 2018 of a significant reduction in distributions to its common unitholders, including us. There can be no assurance that quarterly distributions from CCLP will increase from this amount per unit going forward.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAn off balance sheet arrangement\u201d is defined as any contractual arrangement to which an entity that is not consolidated with us is a party, under which we have, or in the future may have:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>any obligation under a guarantee contract that requires initial recognition and measurement under U.S. GAAP;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity, or market risk support to that entity for the transferred assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>any obligation under certain derivative instruments; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>any obligation under a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services with us.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no off balance sheet arrangements\u201d that may have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. For a discussion of operating leases, including the lease of our corporate headquarters facility, see Note G - \"Leases\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nLitigation\nWe are named defendants in several lawsuits and respondents in certain governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of lawsuits or other proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not consider it reasonably possible that a loss resulting from such lawsuits or other proceedings in excess of any amounts accrued has been incurred that is expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\nOn March 18, 2011, we filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Union County, Arkansas, asserting claims of professional negligence, breach of contract and other claims against the engineering firm we hired for engineering design, equipment, procurement, advisory, testing and startup services for our El Dorado, Arkansas chemical production facility. The engineering firm disputed our claims and promptly filed a motion to compel the matter to arbitration. After a lengthy procedural dispute in Arkansas state court, arbitration proceedings were initiated on November 15, 2013. Ultimately, on December 16, 2016, the arbitration panel ruled in our favor, declared us as the prevailing party, and awarded us a total net amount of $12.8 million. We received full payment of the $12.8 million final award on January 5, 2017.\nEnvironmental\nOne of our subsidiaries, TETRA Micronutrients, Inc. (TMI), previously owned and operated a production facility located in Fairbury, Nebraska. TMI is subject to an Administrative Order on Consent issued to American Microtrace, Inc. (n/k/a/ TETRA Micronutrients, Inc.) in the proceeding styled In the Matter of American Microtrace Corporation, EPA I.D. No. NED00610550, Respondent, Docket No. VII-98-H-0016, dated September 25, 1998 (the Consent Order), with regard to the Fairbury facility. TMI is liable for ongoing environmental monitoring at the Fairbury facility under the Consent Order; however, the current owner of the Fairbury facility is responsible for costs associated with the closure of that facility. While the outcome cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not consider it reasonably possible that a loss in excess of any amounts accrued has been incurred or is expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\nProduct Purchase Obligations\nIn the normal course of our Completion Fluids & Products Division operations, we enter into supply agreements with certain manufacturers of various raw materials and finished products. Some of these agreements have terms and conditions that specify a minimum or maximum level of purchases over the term of the agreement. Other agreements require us to purchase the entire output of the raw material or finished product produced by the manufacturer. Our purchase obligations under these agreements apply only with regard to raw materials and finished products that meet specifications set forth in the agreements. We recognize a liability for the purchase of such products at the time we receive them. As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate amount of the fixed and determinable portion of the purchase obligation pursuant to our Completion Fluids & Products Division's supply agreements was approximately $104.0 million, extending through 2029.\nContingencies of Discontinued Operations\nDuring 2011, in connection with the sale of a significant majority of Maritech's oil and gas producing properties, the buyers of the properties assumed the associated decommissioning liabilities pursuant to the purchase and sale agreements. To the extent that a buyer of these properties fails to perform the abandonment and decommissioning work required, a previous owner, including Maritech, may be required to perform the abandonment and decommissioning obligation. As the former parent company of Maritech, we also may be responsible for performing these abandonment and decommissioning obligations. In March 2018, we closed the Maritech Asset Purchase Agreement with Orinoco that provided for the purchase by Orinoco of the Maritech Properties. Also in March 2018, we finalized the Maritech Equity Purchase Agreement with Orinoco that provided for the purchase by Orinoco of the Maritech Equity Interests. As a result of these transactions, we have effectively exited the businesses of our Maritech segment and Orinoco assumed all of Maritech's remaining abandonment and decommissioning obligations.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\nThe following discussion is intended to analyze major elements of our consolidated financial statements and provide insight into important areas of management's focus. This section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Statements in the following discussion may include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d for additional discussion of these factors and risks.\nFollowing the acquisition of SwiftWater and the disposition of the Offshore Division during the three month period ended March 31, 2018, we reorganized our reporting segments and now manage our operations through three divisions: Completion Fluids & Products, Water & Flowback Services, and Compression. Our Completion Fluids & Products Division was previously reported as our Fluids Division, and included our water management services operations. Following the acquisition of SwiftWater in February 2018, our expanded water management operations are now included with our production testing operations as part of our Water & Flowback Services Division. The operations of our previous Offshore Division, consisting of our previous Offshore Services and Maritech segments, are now reported as discontinued operations following their disposal in March 2018.\nBusiness Overview\nOur consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflected the strong improvement in demand for the products and services of many of our businesses. A strong increase in demand for compression equipment and services resulted in our Compression Division contributing a $143.1 million increase to consolidated revenues compared to 2017 and generating improved gross profit compared to the prior year primarily as a result of improved pricing. Improved onshore domestic rig counts and completion activity during 2018, along with the acquisition of SwiftWater Energy Services, LLC (\"SwiftWater\") during February 2018, led to the growth of our Water & Flowback Services Division, which reported increased revenues of $131.5 million compared to 2017, along with significantly increased gross profit compared to the prior year. Our Completion Fluids & Products Division reported revenues during 2018 consistent with 2017 levels, despite benefiting in the prior year from a TETRA CS Neptune\u00ae completion fluids project, as international activity increased compared to the prior year. Future profitability levels of our Completion Fluids & Products Division will continue to be affected by the timing of future TETRA CS Neptune projects. On a consolidated basis, the increased revenues and gross profit during 2018 were partially offset by increased general and administrative cost levels, reflecting the overall growth in our operations, as well as by increased interest expense, primarily from increased borrowings by our CSI Compressco LP subsidiary (\"CCLP\"). The improved 2018 results occurred despite the impact of decreased oil prices during the fourth quarter of 2018. We are monitoring the 2019 spending plans of our customers as a result of the current reduced oil prices, and if oil prices decrease further during 2019, demand for many of our products and services could be negatively impacted. The consolidated net loss for 2018 includes the impact of the loss attributed to the March 2018 disposal of our former Offshore Division. That disposition increased our ability to focus on the growth of our core businesses.\nOur consolidated cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $18.0 million, or 27.9%, compared to the prior year. This decrease in consolidated cash provided by operating activities was driven primarily by increased working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventory, driven by the growth of certain of our businesses, and despite increased operating profitability. We and CCLP continue to maintain our efforts to manage working capital. Consolidated capital expenditures were $141.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, and included $104.0 million of capital expenditures by our Compression Division, compared to $51.9 million of consolidated capital expenditures during the prior year, which included $25.9 million by our Compression Division. Capital expenditure levels continue to be monitored carefully for each of our businesses, including CCLP, to insure that capital investments are only made for the most attractive growth opportunities. A majority of CCLP capital expenditures during 2018 were funded by additional long-term debt borrowings. As obtaining additional financing is challenging in the current debt and equity market environment, growth capital expenditures by CCLP during 2019 are expected to be primarily funded by available cash, expected cash provided by operating activities, and up to $15.0 million of new compression services equipment to be purchased by us, whereby we will lease the equipment to CCLP under a finance lease.\nDuring 2018, we continued our focus on enhancing our debt structure, as well as the debt structure of CCLP. During the third quarter of 2018, we entered into a new credit agreement (the Term Credit Agreement\u201d) which provided an initial loan in the amount of $200 million and the availability of additional loans, subject to the terms of the Term Credit Agreement, up to an aggregate amount of $75 million for acquisitions. In addition, during the third quarter of 2018, we entered into an asset-based lending credit agreement (the ABL Credit Agreement\u201d)\nthat provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to $100 million, subject to a borrowing base. As of December 31, 2018, subject to compliance with the covenants, borrowing base, and other provisions of the agreement that may limit borrowings, TETRA had an availability of $47.6 million under this agreement. Proceeds from both the Term Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement were used to repay our 11% Senior Secured Note due November 5, 2022 (the \"11% Senior Notes\") and repay all outstanding borrowings and obligations under our then existing bank credit agreement. Both the note-purchase agreement related to the 11% Senior Note and the then existing bank credit agreement were terminated. To fund its growth, during the first half of 2018, CCLP enhanced its long-term debt structure through the issuance of the CCLP 7.50% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2025 (the \"CCLP Senior Secured Notes\"), repaying and terminating CCLP's prior credit facility (the \"CCLP Prior Credit Facility\"), and entering into a Loan and Security Agreement (the \"CCLP Credit Agreement\"), which provides up to $50.0 million to fund ongoing working capital and letter of credit needs and for general business purposes. As of December 31, 2018, and subject to compliance with the covenants, borrowing base, and other provisions of the agreements that may limit borrowings under the CCLP Credit Agreement, CCLP had availability of $27.1 million. As of March 1, 2019, no borrowings are outstanding under the ABL Credit Agreement or the CCLP Credit Agreement. Key objectives associated with our separate capital structures include the ongoing management of amounts outstanding and available under our ABL Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement, and the CCLP Credit Agreement.\nWe do not analyze or manage our capital structure on a consolidated basis, as there are no cross default provisions, cross collateralization provisions, or cross guarantees between CCLP's long-term debt and TETRA's long-term debt.\nApproximately $633.0 million of our consolidated debt balance carrying value is owed by CCLP and serviced by CCLP's existing cash balances and cash provided by CCLP's operations (less its capital expenditures) and $343.2 million of which is secured by certain assets of CCLP. The following table provides condensed consolidating balance sheet information reflecting our net assets, excluding CCLP (\"TETRA\"), and CCLP's net assets that service our respective capital structures.\n\nTETRA's debt is serviced by existing cash balances and cash provided from operating activities (excluding CCLP) and the distributions we receive from CCLP in excess of our cash capital expenditures (excluding CCLP). During the year ended December 31, 2018, consolidated cash provided from operating activities was $46.6 million, which included approximately $30.1 million generated by CCLP. During 2018, we received $12.1 million from CCLP as our share of CCLP distributions. In December 2018,CCLP announced a significant reduction, for a period of up to four quarters, in the level of cash distributions to its common unitholders, including us, reducing the distribution to $0.04 per common unit per year. CCLP intends to use the cash savings from the reduced distributions to redeem the remaining CCLP Preferred Units outstanding. Despite this reduced level of cash distributions from CCLP to us, we believe that current increased levels of operating activity will allow us and CCLP to continue to meet our respective financial obligations and fund our respective future growth plans as needed.\nFuture demand for our products and services depends primarily on activity in the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry, particularly including the level of expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas reserves, and natural gas compression infrastructure. The future growth of certain of our businesses is dependent on improved future pricing levels of oil and natural gas. When oil and natural gas prices increase, we believe that there are growth opportunities for our products and services, supported primarily by:\n \u2022 increases in technologically driven deepwater oil and gas well completions in the Gulf of Mexico; \n \u2022 applications for many of our products and services in the continuing exploitation and development of shale reservoirs; and \n \u2022 increases in selected international oil and gas exploration and development activities. \nOur Completion Fluids & Products Division generates revenues and cash flows by manufacturing and marketing clear brine fluids (\"CBFs\"), additives, and associated products and services to the oil and gas industry for use in well drilling, completion, and workover operations in the United States and in certain countries in Latin America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The Completion Fluids & Products Division also markets liquid and dry calcium chloride products manufactured at its production facilities or purchased from third-party suppliers to a variety of markets outside the energy industry. Completion Fluids & Products Division revenues decreased $0.4 million during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to product and services sales revenues during 2017 associated with a TETRA CS Neptune completion fluid project, and despite improving demand for CBFs and associated product sales in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during 2018. While offshore rig counts remain low, we have seen an increase in demand from our customers. In addition, international offshore fluid sales and onshore manufactured product sales increased compared to the prior year.\nOur Water & Flowback Services Division provides oil and gas operators with comprehensive water management services as well as frac flowback, production well testing, offshore rig cooling, and other associated services in many of the major oil and gas producing regions in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, as well as in oil and gas basins in certain regions in South America, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Australia. The Water & Flowback Services Division's operations are generally driven by the demand for natural gas and oil and the resulting levels of drilling and completion activities in the markets that the Water & Flowback Services Division serves. Many of the markets served by the Water & Flowback Services Division are characterized by high lifting costs for oil and natural gas, such as in certain unconventional shale gas and oil reservoirs located in certain basins in the U.S., Canada, and certain other international markets. North American onshore rig counts increased during 2018 compared to the prior year. The Water & Flowback Services Division's revenues increased by $131.5 million in 2018 compared to 2017, due to increased activity in certain domestic and international markets and due to the impact of acquired water management services businesses, particularly from the February 28, 2018 acquisition of SwiftWater. Onshore U.S. activity levels in certain markets have reflected increased rig counts compared to the prior year, although customer demand for services during the fourth quarter of 2018 has been reduced due to the recent decline in oil prices.\nOur Compression Division, through CCLP, generates revenues and cash flows by providing compression services and equipment for natural gas and oil production, gathering, transportation, processing, and storage. The Compression Division's equipment sales business includes the fabrication and sale of standard compressor packages and custom-designed compressor packages designed and fabricated at the Compression Division's facilities. The Compression Division's aftermarket business provides a wide range of services including operation, maintenance, overhaul and reconfiguration services as well as the sale of compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers. The Compression Division provides its services and equipment to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, transmission, and storage companies operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States as well as in a number of foreign countries, including Mexico, Canada and Argentina. Compression Division revenues increased $143.1 million in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to a significant increase in revenues from sales of compressor equipment, as well as increased compression and related services revenues. The overall utilization of the Compression Division's compression fleet has improved sequentially for the past two years, reflecting increasing demand for compression services.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements. We prepared these financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, estimates, and judgments that affect the amounts reported. We base these estimates on historical experience, available information, and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. We periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those related to potential impairments of long-lived assets (including goodwill), the fair value of financial instruments (our outstanding stock warrants (the \"Warrants\") and CCLP Preferred Units), the collectability of accounts receivable, the current cost of future asset retirement obligations, the allocation of acquisition purchase price consideration and the fair value of contingent acquisition consideration. Note B - \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters. The fair values of portions of our total assets and liabilities are measured using significant unobservable inputs. The combination of these factors forms the basis for our judgments made about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. These judgments and estimates may change as new events occur, as new information is acquired, and as changes in our operating environments\nare encountered. Actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates, and those differences may be material. The following critical accounting policies reflect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nDuring 2016, we issued the Warrants and CCLP issued the CCLP Preferred Units as part of equity offerings to generate proceeds that were used to reduce long-term debt outstanding. The Warrants are accounted for as a derivative liability in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 815 \"Derivatives and Hedging\" and therefore they are classified as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet at their fair value. The CCLP Preferred Units may be settled using a variable number of common units, and therefore the fair value of the CCLP Preferred Units is classified as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with ASC 480 \"Distinguishing Liabilities and Equity.\" Changes in fair value of these financial instruments during each quarterly period are charged to earnings in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Warrants are valued using the Black Scholes option valuation model that includes estimates of the volatility of the Warrants based on their trading prices. The CCLP Preferred Units are valued using market information related to debt instruments, the trading price of the CCLP common units, and lattice modeling techniques. The fair values of the Warrants and the CCLP Preferred Units will generally increase or decrease with the trading price and volatility of our common stock and the CCLP common units, respectively. Increases (or decreases) in the fair value of these financial instruments will increase (decrease) the associated liability, resulting in future adjustments to earnings for the associated valuation losses (gains), and resulting in future volatility of our earnings during the period the financial instruments are outstanding. These estimates used in the calculated fair values of these financial instruments may not be accurate. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of the Warrants was $2.1 million, and the $11.1 million change in fair value during the year was credited to earnings during the period. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of the CCLP Preferred Units was $27.0 million, and the $0.7 million change in fair value during the year was credited to earnings during the period.\nAcquisition Purchase Price Allocations\nWe account for acquisitions of businesses using the purchase method, which requires the allocation of the purchase price consideration based on the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired. We estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired using accepted valuation methods, and, in many cases, such estimates are based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows expected to be generated from the acquired assets throughout their estimated useful lives. Following the February 28, 2018 acquisition of SwiftWater and the December 6, 2018 acquisition of JRGO, we have accounted for the various assets (including intangible assets) and liabilities acquired based on our estimate of their fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition purchase price consideration over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired. Our estimates and judgments of the fair value of acquired businesses are imprecise, and the use of inaccurate fair value estimates could result in the improper allocation of the acquisition purchase price consideration to acquired assets and liabilities, which could result in asset impairments, the recording of previously unrecorded liabilities, and other financial statement adjustments. The difficulty in estimating the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities is increased during periods of economic uncertainty.\nContingent Consideration\nAs part of the purchase of SwiftWater we may be required to pay additional contingent consideration, in an aggregate amount of up to $15.0 million, calculated on EBITDA and revenue of the combined water management business of SwiftWater and our pre-existing operations in the Permian Basin in respect of the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019. The contingent consideration may be paid in cash or shares of our common stock, at our election. The fair value of the contingent consideration is based on a probability simulation utilizing forecasted revenues and EBITDA of the water management business of SwiftWater and all of our pre-existing operations in the Permian Basin (a Level 3 fair value measurement). During the period from the closing date to December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value for the liabilities associated with the contingent purchase price consideration increased to $11.0 million, resulting in $3.4 million being charged to other (income) expense, net, during the year ended December 31, 2018. As part of the purchase of JRGO, we may be required to pay additional contingent consideration, in an aggregate amount of up to $1.5 million, during 2019 based on JRGO's performance during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe determination of impairment of long-lived assets, including identified intangible assets, is conducted periodically whenever indicators of impairment are present. If such indicators are present, the determination of the amount of impairment is based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives. If an impairment of a long-lived asset is warranted, we estimate the fair value of the asset based on a present value of these cash flows or the value that could be realized from disposing of the asset in a transaction between market participants. The oil and gas industry is cyclical, and our estimates of the amount of future cash flows, the period over which these estimated future cash flows will be generated, as well as the fair value of an impaired asset, are imprecise. Our failure to accurately estimate these future operating cash flows or fair values could result in certain long-lived assets being overstated, which could result in impairment charges in periods subsequent to the time in which the impairment indicators were first present. Alternatively, if our estimates of future operating cash flows or fair values are understated, impairments might be recognized unnecessarily or in excess of the appropriate amounts. During 2018, primarily as a result of the decreased expected future cash flows from a specific customer contract, we recorded consolidated impairments and other charges of $3.6 million. During periods of economic uncertainty, the likelihood of additional material impairments of long-lived assets is higher due to the possibility of decreased demand for our products and services.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nThe impairment of goodwill is also assessed whenever impairment indicators are present, but not less than once annually at a reporting unit level. We perform the annual test of goodwill impairment as of the last day of the fourth quarter of each year. As of December 31, 2018, consolidated goodwill consists of $25.9 million attributed to our Water Management reporting unit, included as part of our Water & Flowback Services Division. The first step of the impairment test is to compare the estimated fair value with the recorded net book value (including goodwill) of our reporting units. If the estimated fair value is higher than the recorded net book value, no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required. If, however, the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill to our estimated implied fair value of that goodwill. Our estimates of reporting unit fair value, when required, are based on a combination of an income and market approach. These estimates are imprecise and are subject to our estimates of the future cash flows of each business and our judgment as to how these estimated cash flows translate into each business' estimated fair value. These estimates and judgments are affected by numerous factors, including the general economic environment at the time of our assessment, which affects our overall market capitalization. If we overestimate the fair value of our reporting units, the balance of our goodwill asset may be overstated. Alternatively, if our estimated reporting unit fair values are understated, impairments might be recognized unnecessarily or in excess of the appropriate amounts.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, global oil prices decreased significantly. An accompanying decrease in our common stock price during the fourth quarter of 2018 has also indicated an overall reduction in our market capitalization. As part of our internal annual business outlook for each of our reporting units that we performed during the fourth quarter, we considered changes in the global economic environment that affected our stock price and market capitalization.\nAs part of the first step of goodwill impairment testing for our Water Management reporting unit (part of our Water & Flowback Services Division), the only reporting unit with goodwill as of December 31, 2018, we updated our assessment of the future cash flows, applying expected long-term growth rates, discount rates, and terminal values that we consider reasonable for the reporting unit. We calculated a present value of the cash flows for the Water Management reporting unit to arrive at an estimate of fair value using a combination of the income approach and market approach. Based on these assumptions, we determined that the fair value of the Water Management reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, which includes approximately $25.9 million of goodwill, by approximately 30%. Specific uncertainties affecting the estimated fair value of our Water Management reporting unit includes the impact of competition, prices of oil and natural gas, and future overall activity levels in the regions in which we operate, the activity levels of our significant customers, and other factors affecting the rate of future growth of this reporting unit. These factors will continue to be reviewed and assessed going forward. Negative developments with regard to these factors could have a further negative effect on the fair value of the Water Management reporting unit.\nThroughout 2016, lower oil and natural gas commodity prices resulted in a decreased demand for many of the products and services of each of our reporting units. Specifically to our Compression Division, which is one reporting unit, demand for low-horsepower wellhead compression services and for sales of compressor equipment decreased significantly. During the first quarter of 2016, as the market for services of CCLP continued to decline, the market capitalization of CCLP dropped significantly from December 31, 2015. Accordingly, the fair value, including the market capitalization for CCLP, for the Compression reporting unit was less than its carrying value as of March 31, 2016.\nOur Water & Flowback Services Division has two reporting units; Production Testing and Water Management. For our Production Testing reporting unit, market activity continued to decrease during the first quarter of 2016. As a result, the fair value of the Production Testing reporting unit was also less than its carrying value as of March 31, 2016.\nAfter making the hypothetical purchase price adjustments as part of the second step of the goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2016, we concluded that a full impairment of $92.3 million of remaining recorded goodwill for our Compression reporting unit and a full impairment of $13.9 million of the remaining recorded goodwill for our Production Testing reporting unit (included in our Water & Flowback Services Division) was required as of March 31, 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are a U.S. company and are subject to income taxes in the U.S. We also operate in a number of countries under many legal forms. Our operations are taxed on various bases, including actual income before taxes, deemed profits (which are generally determined using a percentage of revenue rather than profits) and withholding taxes based on revenue. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the applicable tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing, and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the applicable tax laws, and the sources and character of income and tax credits.\nWe provide for income taxes by taking into account the differences between the financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis amounts. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. Management must make certain assumptions regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary and must estimate the timing of their reversal, and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets.\nWe establish valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances, management has considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws, as well as changes in our financial condition, could affect these estimates.\nIn addition, we maintain liabilities for estimated tax exposures and uncertainties in jurisdictions where we operate. The annual tax provision includes the impact of income tax provisions and benefits for changes to liabilities that we consider appropriate, as well as related interest and penalties. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating income tax uncertainties. These factors include an evaluation of the technical merits of the tax position as well as the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement. The actual resolution of those uncertainties will inevitably differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. We believe that an appropriate liability", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\nThe following discussion is intended to analyze major elements of our consolidated financial statements and provide insight into important areas of management's focus. This section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Statements in the following discussion may include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d for additional discussion of these factors and risks.\nFollowing the acquisition of SwiftWater and the disposition of the Offshore Division during the three month period ended March 31, 2018, we reorganized our reporting segments and now manage our operations through three divisions: Completion Fluids & Products, Water & Flowback Services, and Compression. Our Completion Fluids & Products Division was previously reported as our Fluids Division, and included our water management services operations. Following the acquisition of SwiftWater in February 2018, our expanded water management operations are now included with our production testing operations as part of our Water & Flowback Services Division. The operations of our previous Offshore Division, consisting of our previous Offshore Services and Maritech segments, are now reported as discontinued operations following their disposal in March 2018.\nBusiness Overview\nOur consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflected the strong improvement in demand for the products and services of many of our businesses. A strong increase in demand for compression equipment and services resulted in our Compression Division contributing a $143.1 million increase to consolidated revenues compared to 2017 and generating improved gross profit compared to the prior year primarily as a result of improved pricing. Improved onshore domestic rig counts and completion activity during 2018, along with the acquisition of SwiftWater Energy Services, LLC (\"SwiftWater\") during February 2018, led to the growth of our Water & Flowback Services Division, which reported increased revenues of $131.5 million compared to 2017, along with significantly increased gross profit compared to the prior year. Our Completion Fluids & Products Division reported revenues during 2018 consistent with 2017 levels, despite benefiting in the prior year from a TETRA CS Neptune\u00ae completion fluids project, as international activity increased compared to the prior year. Future profitability levels of our Completion Fluids & Products Division will continue to be affected by the timing of future TETRA CS Neptune projects. On a consolidated basis, the increased revenues and gross profit during 2018 were partially offset by increased general and administrative cost levels, reflecting the overall growth in our operations, as well as by increased interest expense, primarily from increased borrowings by our CSI Compressco LP subsidiary (\"CCLP\"). The improved 2018 results occurred despite the impact of decreased oil prices during the fourth quarter of 2018. We are monitoring the 2019 spending plans of our customers as a result of the current reduced oil prices, and if oil prices decrease further during 2019, demand for many of our products and services could be negatively impacted. The consolidated net loss for 2018 includes the impact of the loss attributed to the March 2018 disposal of our former Offshore Division. That disposition increased our ability to focus on the growth of our core businesses.\nOur consolidated cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $18.0 million, or 27.9%, compared to the prior year. This decrease in consolidated cash provided by operating activities was driven primarily by increased working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventory, driven by the growth of certain of our businesses, and despite increased operating profitability. We and CCLP continue to maintain our efforts to manage working capital. Consolidated capital expenditures were $141.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, and included $104.0 million of capital expenditures by our Compression Division, compared to $51.9 million of consolidated capital expenditures during the prior year, which included $25.9 million by our Compression Division. Capital expenditure levels continue to be monitored carefully for each of our businesses, including CCLP, to insure that capital investments are only made for the most attractive growth opportunities. A majority of CCLP capital expenditures during 2018 were funded by additional long-term debt borrowings. As obtaining additional financing is challenging in the current debt and equity market environment, growth capital expenditures by CCLP during 2019 are expected to be primarily funded by available cash, expected cash provided by operating activities, and up to $15.0 million of new compression services equipment to be purchased by us, whereby we will lease the equipment to CCLP under a finance lease.\nDuring 2018, we continued our focus on enhancing our debt structure, as well as the debt structure of CCLP. During the third quarter of 2018, we entered into a new credit agreement (the Term Credit Agreement\u201d) which provided an initial loan in the amount of $200 million and the availability of additional loans, subject to the terms of the Term Credit Agreement, up to an aggregate amount of $75 million for acquisitions. In addition, during the third quarter of 2018, we entered into an asset-based lending credit agreement (the ABL Credit Agreement\u201d)\nthat provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to $100 million, subject to a borrowing base. As of December 31, 2018, subject to compliance with the covenants, borrowing base, and other provisions of the agreement that may limit borrowings, TETRA had an availability of $47.6 million under this agreement. Proceeds from both the Term Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement were used to repay our 11% Senior Secured Note due November 5, 2022 (the \"11% Senior Notes\") and repay all outstanding borrowings and obligations under our then existing bank credit agreement. Both the note-purchase agreement related to the 11% Senior Note and the then existing bank credit agreement were terminated. To fund its growth, during the first half of 2018, CCLP enhanced its long-term debt structure through the issuance of the CCLP 7.50% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2025 (the \"CCLP Senior Secured Notes\"), repaying and terminating CCLP's prior credit facility (the \"CCLP Prior Credit Facility\"), and entering into a Loan and Security Agreement (the \"CCLP Credit Agreement\"), which provides up to $50.0 million to fund ongoing working capital and letter of credit needs and for general business purposes. As of December 31, 2018, and subject to compliance with the covenants, borrowing base, and other provisions of the agreements that may limit borrowings under the CCLP Credit Agreement, CCLP had availability of $27.1 million. As of March 1, 2019, no borrowings are outstanding under the ABL Credit Agreement or the CCLP Credit Agreement. Key objectives associated with our separate capital structures include the ongoing management of amounts outstanding and available under our ABL Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement, and the CCLP Credit Agreement.\nWe do not analyze or manage our capital structure on a consolidated basis, as there are no cross default provisions, cross collateralization provisions, or cross guarantees between CCLP's long-term debt and TETRA's long-term debt.\nApproximately $633.0 million of our consolidated debt balance carrying value is owed by CCLP and serviced by CCLP's existing cash balances and cash provided by CCLP's operations (less its capital expenditures) and $343.2 million of which is secured by certain assets of CCLP. The following table provides condensed consolidating balance sheet information reflecting our net assets, excluding CCLP (\"TETRA\"), and CCLP's net assets that service our respective capital structures.\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Condensed Consolidating Balance Sheet\n</td> <td>TETRA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CCLP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Eliminations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, excluding restricted cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Affiliate receivables\n</td> <td>3,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,517\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets of discontinued operations\n</td> <td>1,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other current assets\n</td> <td>223,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>359,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property, plant and equipment, net\n</td> <td>212,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>641,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>853,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other assets, including investment in CCLP\n</td> <td>29,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>494,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>826,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,385,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Affiliate payables\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,517\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion of long-term debt\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other current liabilities\n</td> <td>105,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, net\n</td> <td>182,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>633,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>815,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CCLP Series A Preferred Units\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,881\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warrant liability\n</td> <td>2,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-current liabilities\n</td> <td>26,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total equity\n</td> <td>173,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>312,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities and equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>494,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>826,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,385,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTETRA's debt is serviced by existing cash balances and cash provided from operating activities (excluding CCLP) and the distributions we receive from CCLP in excess of our cash capital expenditures (excluding CCLP). During the year ended December 31, 2018, consolidated cash provided from operating activities was $46.6 million, which included approximately $30.1 million generated by CCLP. During 2018, we received $12.1 million from CCLP as our share of CCLP distributions. In December 2018,CCLP announced a significant reduction, for a period of up to four quarters, in the level of cash distributions to its common unitholders, including us, reducing the distribution to $0.04 per common unit per year. CCLP intends to use the cash savings from the reduced distributions to redeem the remaining CCLP Preferred Units outstanding. Despite this reduced level of cash distributions from CCLP to us, we believe that current increased levels of operating activity will allow us and CCLP to continue to meet our respective financial obligations and fund our respective future growth plans as needed.\nFuture demand for our products and services depends primarily on activity in the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry, particularly including the level of expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas reserves, and natural gas compression infrastructure. The future growth of certain of our businesses is dependent on improved future pricing levels of oil and natural gas. When oil and natural gas prices increase, we believe that there are growth opportunities for our products and services, supported primarily by:\n \u2022 increases in technologically driven deepwater oil and gas well completions in the Gulf of Mexico; \n \u2022 applications for many of our products and services in the continuing exploitation and development of shale reservoirs; and \n \u2022 increases in selected international oil and gas exploration and development activities. \nOur Completion Fluids & Products Division generates revenues and cash flows by manufacturing and marketing clear brine fluids (\"CBFs\"), additives, and associated products and services to the oil and gas industry for use in well drilling, completion, and workover operations in the United States and in certain countries in Latin America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The Completion Fluids & Products Division also markets liquid and dry calcium chloride products manufactured at its production facilities or purchased from third-party suppliers to a variety of markets outside the energy industry. Completion Fluids & Products Division revenues decreased $0.4 million during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to product and services sales revenues during 2017 associated with a TETRA CS Neptune completion fluid project, and despite improving demand for CBFs and associated product sales in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during 2018. While offshore rig counts remain low, we have seen an increase in demand from our customers. In addition, international offshore fluid sales and onshore manufactured product sales increased compared to the prior year.\nOur Water & Flowback Services Division provides oil and gas operators with comprehensive water management services as well as frac flowback, production well testing, offshore rig cooling, and other associated services in many of the major oil and gas producing regions in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, as well as in oil and gas basins in certain regions in South America, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Australia. The Water & Flowback Services Division's operations are generally driven by the demand for natural gas and oil and the resulting levels of drilling and completion activities in the markets that the Water & Flowback Services Division serves. Many of the markets served by the Water & Flowback Services Division are characterized by high lifting costs for oil and natural gas, such as in certain unconventional shale gas and oil reservoirs located in certain basins in the U.S., Canada, and certain other international markets. North American onshore rig counts increased during 2018 compared to the prior year. The Water & Flowback Services Division's revenues increased by $131.5 million in 2018 compared to 2017, due to increased activity in certain domestic and international markets and due to the impact of acquired water management services businesses, particularly from the February 28, 2018 acquisition of SwiftWater. Onshore U.S. activity levels in certain markets have reflected increased rig counts compared to the prior year, although customer demand for services during the fourth quarter of 2018 has been reduced due to the recent decline in oil prices.\nOur Compression Division, through CCLP, generates revenues and cash flows by providing compression services and equipment for natural gas and oil production, gathering, transportation, processing, and storage. The Compression Division's equipment sales business includes the fabrication and sale of standard compressor packages and custom-designed compressor packages designed and fabricated at the Compression Division's facilities. The Compression Division's aftermarket business provides a wide range of services including operation, maintenance, overhaul and reconfiguration services as well as the sale of compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers. The Compression Division provides its services and equipment to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, transmission, and storage companies operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States as well as in a number of foreign countries, including Mexico, Canada and Argentina. Compression Division revenues increased $143.1 million in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to a significant increase in revenues from sales of compressor equipment, as well as increased compression and related services revenues. The overall utilization of the Compression Division's compression fleet has improved sequentially for the past two years, reflecting increasing demand for compression services.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements. We prepared these financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, estimates, and judgments that affect the amounts reported. We base these estimates on historical experience, available information, and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. We periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those related to potential impairments of long-lived assets (including goodwill), the fair value of financial instruments (our outstanding stock warrants (the \"Warrants\") and CCLP Preferred Units), the collectability of accounts receivable, the current cost of future asset retirement obligations, the allocation of acquisition purchase price consideration and the fair value of contingent acquisition consideration. Note B - \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters. The fair values of portions of our total assets and liabilities are measured using significant unobservable inputs. The combination of these factors forms the basis for our judgments made about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. These judgments and estimates may change as new events occur, as new information is acquired, and as changes in our operating environments\nare encountered. Actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates, and those differences may be material. The following critical accounting policies reflect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nDuring 2016, we issued the Warrants and CCLP issued the CCLP Preferred Units as part of equity offerings to generate proceeds that were used to reduce long-term debt outstanding. The Warrants are accounted for as a derivative liability in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 815 \"Derivatives and Hedging\" and therefore they are classified as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet at their fair value. The CCLP Preferred Units may be settled using a variable number of common units, and therefore the fair value of the CCLP Preferred Units is classified as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with ASC 480 \"Distinguishing Liabilities and Equity.\" Changes in fair value of these financial instruments during each quarterly period are charged to earnings in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Warrants are valued using the Black Scholes option valuation model that includes estimates of the volatility of the Warrants based on their trading prices. The CCLP Preferred Units are valued using market information related to debt instruments, the trading price of the CCLP common units, and lattice modeling techniques. The fair values of the Warrants and the CCLP Preferred Units will generally increase or decrease with the trading price and volatility of our common stock and the CCLP common units, respectively. Increases (or decreases) in the fair value of these financial instruments will increase (decrease) the associated liability, resulting in future adjustments to earnings for the associated valuation losses (gains), and resulting in future volatility of our earnings during the period the financial instruments are outstanding. These estimates used in the calculated fair values of these financial instruments may not be accurate. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of the Warrants was $2.1 million, and the $11.1 million change in fair value during the year was credited to earnings during the period. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of the CCLP Preferred Units was $27.0 million, and the $0.7 million change in fair value during the year was credited to earnings during the period.\nAcquisition Purchase Price Allocations\nWe account for acquisitions of businesses using the purchase method, which requires the allocation of the purchase price consideration based on the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired. We estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired using accepted valuation methods, and, in many cases, such estimates are based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows expected to be generated from the acquired assets throughout their estimated useful lives. Following the February 28, 2018 acquisition of SwiftWater and the December 6, 2018 acquisition of JRGO, we have accounted for the various assets (including intangible assets) and liabilities acquired based on our estimate of their fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition purchase price consideration over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired. Our estimates and judgments of the fair value of acquired businesses are imprecise, and the use of inaccurate fair value estimates could result in the improper allocation of the acquisition purchase price consideration to acquired assets and liabilities, which could result in asset impairments, the recording of previously unrecorded liabilities, and other financial statement adjustments. The difficulty in estimating the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities is increased during periods of economic uncertainty.\nContingent Consideration\nAs part of the purchase of SwiftWater we may be required to pay additional contingent consideration, in an aggregate amount of up to $15.0 million, calculated on EBITDA and revenue of the combined water management business of SwiftWater and our pre-existing operations in the Permian Basin in respect of the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019. The contingent consideration may be paid in cash or shares of our common stock, at our election. The fair value of the contingent consideration is based on a probability simulation utilizing forecasted revenues and EBITDA of the water management business of SwiftWater and all of our pre-existing operations in the Permian Basin (a Level 3 fair value measurement). During the period from the closing date to December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value for the liabilities associated with the contingent purchase price consideration increased to $11.0 million, resulting in $3.4 million being charged to other (income) expense, net, during the year ended December 31, 2018. As part of the purchase of JRGO, we may be required to pay additional contingent consideration, in an aggregate amount of up to $1.5 million, during 2019 based on JRGO's performance during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe determination of impairment of long-lived assets, including identified intangible assets, is conducted periodically whenever indicators of impairment are present. If such indicators are present, the determination of the amount of impairment is based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives. If an impairment of a long-lived asset is warranted, we estimate the fair value of the asset based on a present value of these cash flows or the value that could be realized from disposing of the asset in a transaction between market participants. The oil and gas industry is cyclical, and our estimates of the amount of future cash flows, the period over which these estimated future cash flows will be generated, as well as the fair value of an impaired asset, are imprecise. Our failure to accurately estimate these future operating cash flows or fair values could result in certain long-lived assets being overstated, which could result in impairment charges in periods subsequent to the time in which the impairment indicators were first present. Alternatively, if our estimates of future operating cash flows or fair values are understated, impairments might be recognized unnecessarily or in excess of the appropriate amounts. During 2018, primarily as a result of the decreased expected future cash flows from a specific customer contract, we recorded consolidated impairments and other charges of $3.6 million. During periods of economic uncertainty, the likelihood of additional material impairments of long-lived assets is higher due to the possibility of decreased demand for our products and services.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nThe impairment of goodwill is also assessed whenever impairment indicators are present, but not less than once annually at a reporting unit level. We perform the annual test of goodwill impairment as of the last day of the fourth quarter of each year. As of December 31, 2018, consolidated goodwill consists of $25.9 million attributed to our Water Management reporting unit, included as part of our Water & Flowback Services Division. The first step of the impairment test is to compare the estimated fair value with the recorded net book value (including goodwill) of our reporting units. If the estimated fair value is higher than the recorded net book value, no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required. If, however, the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill to our estimated implied fair value of that goodwill. Our estimates of reporting unit fair value, when required, are based on a combination of an income and market approach. These estimates are imprecise and are subject to our estimates of the future cash flows of each business and our judgment as to how these estimated cash flows translate into each business' estimated fair value. These estimates and judgments are affected by numerous factors, including the general economic environment at the time of our assessment, which affects our overall market capitalization. If we overestimate the fair value of our reporting units, the balance of our goodwill asset may be overstated. Alternatively, if our estimated reporting unit fair values are understated, impairments might be recognized unnecessarily or in excess of the appropriate amounts.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, global oil prices decreased significantly. An accompanying decrease in our common stock price during the fourth quarter of 2018 has also indicated an overall reduction in our market capitalization. As part of our internal annual business outlook for each of our reporting units that we performed during the fourth quarter, we considered changes in the global economic environment that affected our stock price and market capitalization.\nAs part of the first step of goodwill impairment testing for our Water Management reporting unit (part of our Water & Flowback Services Division), the only reporting unit with goodwill as of December 31, 2018, we updated our assessment of the future cash flows, applying expected long-term growth rates, discount rates, and terminal values that we consider reasonable for the reporting unit. We calculated a present value of the cash flows for the Water Management reporting unit to arrive at an estimate of fair value using a combination of the income approach and market approach. Based on these assumptions, we determined that the fair value of the Water Management reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, which includes approximately $25.9 million of goodwill, by approximately 30%. Specific uncertainties affecting the estimated fair value of our Water Management reporting unit includes the impact of competition, prices of oil and natural gas, and future overall activity levels in the regions in which we operate, the activity levels of our significant customers, and other factors affecting the rate of future growth of this reporting unit. These factors will continue to be reviewed and assessed going forward. Negative developments with regard to these factors could have a further negative effect on the fair value of the Water Management reporting unit.\nThroughout 2016, lower oil and natural gas commodity prices resulted in a decreased demand for many of the products and services of each of our reporting units. Specifically to our Compression Division, which is one reporting unit, demand for low-horsepower wellhead compression services and for sales of compressor equipment decreased significantly. During the first quarter of 2016, as the market for services of CCLP continued to decline, the market capitalization of CCLP dropped significantly from December 31, 2015. Accordingly, the fair value, including the market capitalization for CCLP, for the Compression reporting unit was less than its carrying value as of March 31, 2016.\nOur Water & Flowback Services Division has two reporting units; Production Testing and Water Management. For our Production Testing reporting unit, market activity continued to decrease during the first quarter of 2016. As a result, the fair value of the Production Testing reporting unit was also less than its carrying value as of March 31, 2016.\nAfter making the hypothetical purchase price adjustments as part of the second step of the goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2016, we concluded that a full impairment of $92.3 million of remaining recorded goodwill for our Compression reporting unit and a full impairment of $13.9 million of the remaining recorded goodwill for our Production Testing reporting unit (included in our Water & Flowback Services Division) was required as of March 31, 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are a U.S. company and are subject to income taxes in the U.S. We also operate in a number of countries under many legal forms. Our operations are taxed on various bases, including actual income before taxes, deemed profits (which are generally determined using a percentage of revenue rather than profits) and withholding taxes based on revenue. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the applicable tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing, and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the applicable tax laws, and the sources and character of income and tax credits.\nWe provide for income taxes by taking into account the differences between the financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis amounts. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. Management must make certain assumptions regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary and must estimate the timing of their reversal, and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets.\nWe establish valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances, management has considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws, as well as changes in our financial condition, could affect these estimates.\nIn addition, we maintain liabilities for estimated tax exposures and uncertainties in jurisdictions where we operate. The annual tax provision includes the impact of income tax provisions and benefits for changes to liabilities that we consider appropriate, as well as related interest and penalties. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating income tax uncertainties. These factors include an evaluation of the technical merits of the tax position as well as the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement. The actual resolution of those uncertainties will inevitably differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. We believe that an appropriate liability"}
